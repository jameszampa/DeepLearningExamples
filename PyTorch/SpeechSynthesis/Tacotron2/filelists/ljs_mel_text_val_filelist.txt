mels/004899.pt|how about we let you buy up
mels/006584.pt|sort of calls into question the
mels/014250.pt|but i don't blame them for good business they can do that if it works but in ludwig's case i think it was a mistake i think
mels/024243.pt|that supposed to be like a branding ad where
mels/000947.pt|the factor today by the way i'll
mels/009547.pt|that they have to ban the right champions bands are just so incredibly important in i mean bands are important in pro play

mels/021850.pt|he ended up buying twitch instead and basically planting his balls across seattle
mels/002638.pt|do something and then i spend money on it there has to be some kind of game
mels/007171.pt|if you guys don't know i was talking about chic sheik's never ever ever won an event a
mels/015758.pt|the biggest right now but it's also the um
mels/011961.pt|and you start getting text messages from the actors that you've either met or done things with and it's it's obviously not them writing
mels/011162.pt|you put on that tv whose leg is that to the left oh that's just my girl
mels/002185.pt|it to get this twist job and i got it and i
mels/017764.pt|of twitch how does he do that what is different about him he doesn't have
mels/001813.pt|it's called visionaries the visionaries podcast and i was like
mels/004213.pt|gas before we get to that
mels/017549.pt|they are nowhere close to what apple has accomplished in the
mels/006851.pt|there's even a slightly high curb i stop and get off
mels/008556.pt|you know like profit loss revenue and in that report they say they estimate they have about five percent of their users as bots which is actually a really high number
mels/001686.pt|getting rid of that idea or not i want to be clear grandpa joe is
mels/029031.pt|and the rest of the group
mels/017959.pt|how was your monday i was busy my sunday though
mels/022176.pt|well we started off with a bang let's
mels/028530.pt|but like all attack i call like
mels/030176.pt|the the foot race which there is a video of but i think only ludwig has it on his
mels/026732.pt|with the great deals so pretty soon
mels/015312.pt|to sell more toilet paper because that's the strategy here the thing that makes amazon unique among all
mels/003285.pt|what it was a win for unique interpretations of events never saw heat waves like this before the vaccine makes you wonder so that could be a win because
mels/004029.pt|that's uh that's a wins and
mels/008473.pt|up quickly because honestly this is a big is a big boost so as long as he pays
mels/018365.pt|just the thing i do all the time i'm not sure if it's the perfect answer but in general my advice is always include hey i'm happy here i love this place
mels/012532.pt|that's my overall review end of the day i think disney didn't steal my
mels/023113.pt|of the milk and then went to bed all right people didn't give a
mels/022792.pt|that was dumb but they also acquired
mels/017896.pt|and i can't get out now what is your emergency
mels/026749.pt|there is no world where microsoft
mels/016334.pt|do you guys were gonna say it and we all said it together in solidarity kim
mels/015594.pt|of this competition okay they just they don't need to beat walmart and target they just need to grab some cheap stuff
mels/019445.pt|so let's see how effective it was but the promo worked like magic saving the wheaties brand from
mels/014515.pt|into a rough idea of red version if you wouldn't mind looking at it if it's not too late into a rough idea of red version if you wouldn't mind looking at it if it's not too late to make my skyfall thank you man i appreciate that
mels/010813.pt|talks about tax fraud a little bit and that's
mels/025708.pt|if the company full of clowns the whole the whole message becomes that like you have a weird scary dark restaurant full of clowns on halloween if you want a safe
mels/029158.pt|they had the little thing where you could press on them to see how full they
mels/010267.pt|my team but then they asked clint to be his
mels/018487.pt|billion dollars one of the largest acquisitions in the gaming space ever for reference let me try to draw you up
mels/030477.pt|was uncharacteristic but i was feeling like just i
mels/019986.pt|we're doing terribly marvel at the time it was acquired had one movie in marvel studios iron man and most of
mels/021187.pt|in general most of that is owned by very old people so you might be asking why if i just told you that do i predict that it's going to be a good year for millennials the answer is boomers are starting to die if you'll notice it has started to turn
mels/028730.pt|we're getting closer and closer and closer
mels/011049.pt|did they start do they get
mels/007124.pt|asking especially in places like that with like recycled air and
mels/027385.pt|well company that's been stealing sonic
mels/030787.pt|yeah that's actually a subtle take on the current geopolitical climate in iran i'm glad you picked up on that what did you mean by that's an awfully hot coffee pot i was just trying to say the situation in the united states is like that of a coffee pot and it's about to boil over you know
mels/003102.pt|improper a amazon as the number one company
mels/013347.pt|we sort of a hero for being brave enough to tell about it like i would rather be someone who had murdered someone and come clean and said
mels/019259.pt|interested in gimmicks bill today we have the
mels/027460.pt|the official tumblr account was hanging
mels/000586.pt|wait they're all small yeah you can

mels/022079.pt|what the bank is this one why is my balance so low bank
mels/007341.pt|the and that's that was a story but anyway after every sick combo that j mooc would do aidan would one over to my my the and that's that was the story but anyway after every sick combo that mook would
mels/030122.pt|is the perfect example actually getting a
mels/020882.pt|don't have what it takes this is legit advice people who tell you to start a business are not thinking about what that means
mels/006164.pt|whenever i play that fruit matching game i just alter
mels/003500.pt|tips bill that went through congress to it's basically going to all go to intel to make foundries which are the factories that make chips
mels/025784.pt|do it we're just not gonna
mels/025233.pt|we watching streams and streaming themselves uh they've already banned if
mels/003347.pt|and and loan debt and what we're starting to see if you keep a real close eye on the ball is
mels/023957.pt|why not branding they can save costs because marketing is expensive
mels/027056.pt|the same thing as the matt
mels/011098.pt|what are we talking about oh my god what a waste
mels/031641.pt|it was like an extra special
mels/029534.pt|and he's wearing a suit for the first time i think i've seen him on commentary

mels/020672.pt|kind of crass kind of low brow but thank you congratulations
mels/010121.pt|was like a disaster waiting to happen pro tip don't get pepper sprayed
mels/023057.pt|kind of a sacrifice they're kind of a martyr
mels/030144.pt|two weeks i think i said on stream like hey if you guys want other content pass
mels/000100.pt|we movie brother can't wait to see there i pants next thing we movie brother can't wait to see you there
mels/020937.pt|you can get rich quick this is this
mels/006620.pt|far but at a farm four five six banana farm
mels/012401.pt|the the die they warned us that like if the red alarm goes off it's part of the immersion because otherwise you'd be
mels/025308.pt|give out some fails oh yeah
mels/028495.pt|private johnson you could go you could get out and i'm like well
mels/002588.pt|every marketer hey keep it up king and godspeed let's roll it classic kyle classic oh kyle i think the
mels/018748.pt|noticeable camera change in the back and
mels/027356.pt|the nucleus what's the core thing that is
mels/015679.pt|while them are going to look to either merge or require someone else to get bigger
mels/024120.pt|at the pump those numbers up the comments are that came out of nowhere really random to have happened but okay and that's it
mels/005432.pt|trump to this joke everything is planned now that i've spoken to
mels/008908.pt|talk to pay the musician by the way hey update
mels/031384.pt|and he was just a delight
mels/022916.pt|i was under the impression there was no movement with microsoft either
mels/026040.pt|with the world's largest private employer by
mels/031148.pt|more than any streamer that's the real problem okay and i think other streamers in the same position would have been less generous i think he did a good thing with the mods i think
mels/012410.pt|so so anyway we were like off in our group and but luckily luckily on our side is like a bunch of
mels/025780.pt|we said that and she quit three months in then they cancelled
mels/024707.pt|in per minute when you're subbed so you can convert your useless
mels/001517.pt|at everyone's had a good positive
mels/022135.pt|it's a miserable thankless job corporate emails are the worst so it's a miserable job i remember
mels/020823.pt|wow this is an honor and
mels/005617.pt|he lied way more than i thought
mels/011858.pt|the bed was comfy and it was cool so
mels/009697.pt|is as easy to flow off the tongue as it was
mels/029497.pt|brett there might not even be bread under
mels/009250.pt|but i will you know what i'll do i want to bring back so like right when
mels/021472.pt|for another rise now again my recommendation as always is
mels/001181.pt|i say i've been using factor for a long time now and i like i like it i think it's like when when my
mels/024798.pt|they had a promo where if you took
mels/005206.pt|it'll make me better it'll make me stronger and so that's that's how we ended up
mels/023619.pt|these bars they sent me a care package a few months ago for the first go around and
mels/027605.pt|got to retain talent and so employer reactions
mels/006658.pt|compared to like compare the seven hours i spent on teresa in my mind in my mind
mels/005679.pt|say the story as an outsider who still had a
mels/031431.pt|was almost lost to the sea like
mels/019137.pt|the zone and it'll be here by tomorrow
mels/005160.pt|it does look like it you just can't i'm
mels/029309.pt|i would love to work on riot he's like you can come i'm
mels/011391.pt|watch ads to make up for that
mels/019218.pt|realizing there was a god when I saw this on like
mels/028777.pt|it will probably wouldn't even give me the job i was making so little that like they would think i'm not serious
mels/005904.pt|at the time dinner had lapsed
mels/002945.pt|where was like i'm kind of interested and
mels/023335.pt|and i know that it's been a long time coming but i just mean i think we're really starting to see within the past year or two that the democratization of the internet into all these different hyper niches create sort of micro celebrities with still massive massive value because they can capture attention in ways that
mels/009997.pt|i don't want to be a bully
mels/021466.pt|now they could still lose it tomorrow because what happened
mels/032427.pt|if the the gatekeeping is a disease
mels/022687.pt|be hands off the first thing she said was
mels/025254.pt|i can't wait to see a very
mels/019493.pt|that advertising in general is just becoming a tax on the poor it's becoming a world where you can avoid almost all ads it used to be pervasive
mels/003281.pt|when actual win here i'm being serious okay
mels/020429.pt|where you buy pepsi only because you
mels/005836.pt|i had to have the only awkward conversation that i had to have
mels/022461.pt|greatness is no more unique to us than breathing we're all capable of it just one minute long unbroken shot of a guy starting his jogging regime it's such a powerful image it's such a break from what they normally do with the best
mels/030783.pt|i mean when you wrote i know i said i was top
mels/029874.pt|he was that guy for music
mels/004892.pt|so you'd want to watch it kind of
mels/027741.pt|are now I do now I
mels/022598.pt|if the forward the playstation flow body dryer it'll draw you
mels/011999.pt|it's wanted to help out kroy
mels/028653.pt|comes in the door okay unlocks it looks
mels/011878.pt|thought to explore the ship and the ship's pretty cool i go look there's i mean again this
mels/019079.pt|outnumbering real ones but i think we are close to a world where we have a fake influencer who has the reach and impact of the top real influencers at the end of the day it's just
mels/017273.pt|dub so quickly it turns out disney's lawyers have gotten their hooks into it and made it very clear that disney's depiction of winnie the pooh is still under copyright only the character from the books has entered the public domain he created this nice little rhyme red shirt on the bear artist beware if
mels/007974.pt|elusive target and i bet you guys
mels/017811.pt|if you learned a little thing or two about way to think about marketing through the clock model and
mels/021536.pt|in a lot of people who don't have the money getting hurt of that's why i'm i'm i'm ambivalent we don't talk about is that there's there's other in a lot of people who don't have the money getting hurt so that's why i'm i'm i'm uh ambivalent
mels/012192.pt|like doing something you were like she was
mels/029058.pt|was my ride he drove me to the theater he's my friend he was my only way home so at this point i think i'm
mels/018436.pt|this is why this circle here is why this
mels/011830.pt|if the five racks for two nights and i tried it
mels/032277.pt|and everybody i mean even jess
mels/019317.pt|this kid was clearly from day one not going to do any work on this project the other kid was named jason he was you know sure
mels/008887.pt|i they want to make this buyout to begin with
mels/027877.pt|i think of like um let's
mels/019612.pt|i want to put little caesars up here up here
mels/007682.pt|they just won't move off the shelves
mels/007398.pt|but i think because of the way when they had
mels/024587.pt|and i thought that was a pretty good
mels/031582.pt|ambushes it in the middle of
mels/028358.pt|ash bros that's what i hope
mels/028656.pt|you want to look around you want
mels/011395.pt|our wars cocktail that you can get i didn't buy it okay i ordered it there's a difference okay i did i
mels/013092.pt|wanna call it a little early get ready for marketing monday sevens i'm glad to be back i hope you enjoyed the tale of my five thousand dollar disney adventure truly assorted one but i did have a good time
mels/005856.pt|we all of it i think that's all of it uh
mels/001817.pt|the problem is visionary doesn't go far enough it's like am i just
mels/003108.pt|uniquely negative experiences or the fact that euro there's hundreds
mels/013509.pt|well as is half empty and let
mels/003783.pt|so they have a game plan
mels/020430.pt|because you might have a chance to win cash
mels/011075.pt|not true not true my friend uh another
mels/028815.pt|i realized very quickly that sf rents
mels/031769.pt|well a little bit deep on these uh
mels/007950.pt|what makes you so awesome is it perhaps your
mels/029833.pt|or the story is look how wrong he was
mels/001565.pt|i thought it was stumping for sure
mels/025192.pt|clever and like get people on their side
mels/027101.pt|empire with an absolute ruler they inflated the currency steadily for
mels/010990.pt|myself a accomplished chef by most metrics
mels/011897.pt|i do this dude i'm gonna be
mels/002863.pt|over the difference in the in the in the fall
mels/026202.pt|i had to watch it on stanz's tv which
mels/012619.pt|is there were like talking about galaxies they were like talking about galaxies
mels/021005.pt|i'm already ready real album wait really
mels/014867.pt|with everything we love is gonna
mels/016445.pt|get our shitty company for low wages
mels/023555.pt|and then they just use their dominant market share to win other things so for example
mels/024679.pt|so what is particularly interesting is that so much of crypto is owned and
mels/010330.pt|you guys are still suggesting people even though we've got way over budget here
mels/000439.pt|that you've ever won in vegas ever
mels/019985.pt|i was doing great in animation we're doing
mels/021634.pt|a lot of mixed opinions in the
mels/025757.pt|to answered for so they always go absolutely over the top with making you feel something
mels/004664.pt|the office to give us a speech and like you know rally the marketing troops
mels/031451.pt|but stanz did survive poseidon's wrath
mels/023392.pt|when my boomer boss's boss made me print out emails print them out and take a red marker and go through
mels/008696.pt|their lawsuit that i'm looking at here is like pretty open about it like they they
mels/015008.pt|so yeah they're done but now let's let's
mels/025726.pt|horror into a candy commercial so it is a cool idea it probably got some buzz
mels/012046.pt|this time it's just a very obvious like the wall lights up
mels/028784.pt|that line i practiced it okay so she asked me the question comes and she goes
mels/002862.pt|so it'll be you know it could be 12 to
mels/004464.pt|it's not for me the big
mels/026777.pt|if you have a kidney you could sell these are all and then even if the whatever you buy turns out to be stupid and it's cratering just say huddle diamond hands
mels/015904.pt|we have to spend all this money that's correct
mels/030664.pt|in lake so i write it down lake baikal
mels/000823.pt|during today's stream i will think of other
mels/002450.pt|with the whole backstory for jeff and then the
mels/002861.pt|but for the difference between the current share price and the share price he promised to pay for so basically here's what it is now
mels/024622.pt|let's get to the final win and this is a really important win like this
mels/021443.pt|yeah dude more power to you but if you do need the money if you think oh this is how i'm
mels/019450.pt|see before but it's really important most people seem to think that if an ad doesn't get you to buy the thing immediately then it has failed if i watch a car ad and i don't go buy a car that ad failed
mels/030338.pt|to that this is my dad's
mels/004589.pt|the full reset to make sure the new viewers can start from the beginning
mels/006429.pt|for a deep run in the wilderness in old school
mels/012863.pt|so depressed i was so sad
mels/005897.pt|it's crazy that was pretty much of the stuff that i feel comfortable saying
mels/013077.pt|that's the thing is with youtube it's the
mels/010162.pt|i didn't i didn't really like it
mels/012675.pt|elden ring and then i want to do ori and then maybe
mels/022221.pt|in your mind sad it was a ghost i don't like it especially for
mels/000257.pt|if the we're going to be there so now we
mels/007758.pt|if the think embarrassing to say
mels/001582.pt|all right well here we go
mels/002772.pt|a different time zone but at 6
mels/001150.pt|ten minutes ago there were two
mels/023580.pt|at each movie that the weekend that that that the
mels/017067.pt|this week because they've been piling up
mels/015371.pt|what half a billion dollars for each emmy that means to get high quality content amazon has to spend
mels/010702.pt|yeah we're mr b shows up and says i will give you a
mels/022781.pt|now you could be forgiven for not knowing countrywide banking and home
mels/001747.pt|looks at the guy falling and he thinks about it and he's like oh what was that and he said something to his son and his son's like okay grandpa
mels/023854.pt|it was in the 80s but 1995
mels/021795.pt|in kansas all are more than welcome it's no secret the middle has been a hard place to get to lately
mels/018247.pt|six the first six it's the greatest
mels/030051.pt|we've been hoisted by your own petard because
mels/021922.pt|i mean in my early streams i had
mels/003924.pt|at the battle jeb v hunter
mels/000719.pt|but i've been watching like he's seen
mels/026779.pt|lose money when their stock value goes down it's a good question no but having a
mels/025947.pt|we're going to three million dollars franchise in the
mels/019569.pt|to have like a bad idea everyone wants to feel like they're contributing so if you show an executive an idea and it's perfect they don't want to
mels/013349.pt|in the murder then somebody just was innocent the whole time
mels/009961.pt|will be disappointed but who cares i'll have content
mels/005487.pt|we even have a comeback or i didn't say anything because i was i didn't
mels/018574.pt|alex when they lose and listen here's the most important thing if there's one thing you take away from all this it's this
mels/029691.pt|like that that's actually exactly what i said i will call you the people's
mels/016700.pt|we'll go back to work it is this trend
mels/027516.pt|i always wondered like this entire building it's like you know 12 stories massive
mels/031481.pt|i still firmly believe that the world would be a better place where that wealth
mels/016104.pt|i taught you nothing i apologize i regret
mels/023240.pt|finally i can have my my cake and eat it too it's
mels/021864.pt|or metrics and numbers you you become very fixed on what you know works already okay you get very much locked in
mels/031092.pt|cause i remember me and st
mels/019590.pt|it was i guess they had the free credit
mels/015598.pt|and they don't have gigantic ambitions
mels/000421.pt|he was like he was annoyed and like
mels/025739.pt|you just make a good short that has no
mels/014783.pt|don't then it's not really this is like this is mostly for people who are
mels/031901.pt|be a good friend all right
mels/010666.pt|if you guys don't know my smite name
mels/028718.pt|i have no money and no real connections i need to get to this vip area so i go to my guys at team liquid and
mels/006413.pt|this one comes to what i think is the single greatest linkedin post i've ever seen and that's a high bar because you
mels/012656.pt|it's on your mother and her proclivities in the bedroom it is a very in-depth presentation with video so i would not show up if you don't want to really learn the details but
mels/011198.pt|it is a money it costs no effort and the money just flows in
mels/014440.pt|thanks they've already won but i think youtube
mels/032426.pt|in this game and feel threatened by someone else getting praise for doing them
mels/031778.pt|i really got me great post
mels/025094.pt|like this is a baby game now
mels/013198.pt|these tweets you're going to laugh until you
mels/019145.pt|i think that this is not the most inspired brand partnership you know I'm not but
mels/023531.pt|they have raised the perceived value so high let me see
mels/021858.pt|is running the company flat flat flat barely anything flat a truck h truck joins amazon
mels/014249.pt|kind of predatory and it's like we're not going
mels/027121.pt|the great financial crisis happened we were set for a pretty big depression and what stopped it
mels/013465.pt|that's a crazy that's a crazy
mels/009204.pt|was one of those games where watching
mels/028020.pt|it's still he's still not yet a
mels/027057.pt|it's like and people went to the moon and people sailed uncharted waters and you can buy
mels/016609.pt|important because this is uh a trend
mels/010062.pt|it's because on saturday we get smarter by watching youtube videos the only way that zoomers are
mels/029296.pt|i was like dude i love your stuff he worked on some back to the future game for
mels/031187.pt|with the gym streams and the walk
mels/002096.pt|and then doing that again and again every single season in
mels/019272.pt|literally everything they posted this one you know
mels/004157.pt|if the the god he feels shame for you
mels/024997.pt|you know i don't like their service it's like they're doing something that pisses me off in the moment alaska hates starbucks
mels/000448.pt|introduces me to pineapple vodka which i guess is not a crazy
mels/028102.pt|if you guys don't know china's continuing its
mels/014552.pt|job but like begin exploratory talks but my twitch contract is not in a place currently where i could even think about looking at other offers so
mels/028058.pt|that literally turned around a dying company apple was a dying small company basically kept afloat by microsoft who was giving them money every year to use office so that they could say they had competition literally apple was being kept afloat so that microsoft could go to
mels/021576.pt|we shake hands on it and i'm like
mels/012584.pt|one time every line the entire trip so now i have i click disney every time because i was
mels/004715.pt|help with the video and i told him in discord
mels/023076.pt|that makes me hungry and i constantly have to find new food to fill that gap and marketers can compete basically through differentiation in their brands to get me to buy it i want you to compare this to tech real quick i want you to imagine that you are a rich gamer like the kind of gamer
mels/006785.pt|you know there's it's a split audience here and i could talk about that how miserable that game was forever and i have to get into the
mels/019502.pt|in the football game or a soccer game or something and you'll see just like a logo like like walls of logos around the edge of the stadium like what does that really do what
mels/013139.pt|are they want to have killer ip and then put it everywhere across every platform and all of the old media companies are trying to get into games like they already have movies and
mels/017810.pt|massive yep clock spam i hope you
mels/027089.pt|is one of the best investors in history pretty old but he has one of the best track records in history
mels/022110.pt|never we've talked about examples before just don't do it it never works now the final thing i want to talk about
mels/004560.pt|i'm getting a water yeah water
mels/017014.pt|in the first time watching market money live
mels/005749.pt|a meter that's filling up at all times any moment that he doesn't have the
mels/004785.pt|it could just walk away and as we remember from his first tweet that i just showed
mels/003551.pt|i don't like it personally this is my opinion but i understand it and i don't try to like shut it down i just don't
mels/006771.pt|when they got stands to even
mels/032339.pt|the necessary a set remember this phrase remember the phrase that descending dark is essentially necessary to make radiant radiance and
mels/024013.pt|we're stopping them from getting the lines of credit and the size of accounts they would need to pay out all their creators and only fans was very worried because
mels/002192.pt|never work a day in your life and there's
mels/016553.pt|as this continues to drop a lot of things in society are
mels/022213.pt|immediately following this stream yeah i
mels/004075.pt|it's like oh thanks for the four months and you
mels/023490.pt|are perceived value ferrari literally limits car sales this is an actual article that i found ferrari actually on purpose
mels/002724.pt|with the wedding because of this i want you to know that one
mels/012141.pt|and i started to pick all the evil options like the
mels/008393.pt|and i just kept noticing they put in actual
mels/029655.pt|when he was like explain he's getting ready
mels/006729.pt|she asked me to decide something
mels/019942.pt|what a million dollars is nothing in business that would
mels/011882.pt|look pretty cool and it really it's like
mels/004750.pt|in for the whole company that's what he's going to
mels/021419.pt|it's okay and it was hurting
mels/011896.pt|like all right i'm gonna commit
mels/015639.pt|in the shows on twitch that and star trek fans i actually
mels/030259.pt|the supplies and i i clean myself
mels/027248.pt|it on this receiving actually most of the
mels/000715.pt|but in high school i always thought you were
mels/009076.pt|way we'd be like not the non-pal
mels/005676.pt|i have been making it big all right
mels/000200.pt|he will only gamble when he can bet against basically everyone else at the
mels/009091.pt|i know i'm so close to finding them
mels/014138.pt|that they won that people can't leave people can't leave and take their audience with them so twitch started to
mels/005441.pt|specifically i mean some of these are fine but this one specifically
mels/009026.pt|this is what i see i think i played resident evil village all week but on this day specifically i just
mels/005105.pt|it's been it's been so much less it's
mels/017786.pt|and post purchase after you become part of the mango nation
mels/003509.pt|now in the long run over hundreds of years the stock market trends upwards and real estate prices have turned
mels/014271.pt|talk about where we're going next with the streaming wars because now things are
mels/031075.pt|starting to feel this and so i threw i threw some games to go back to like down
mels/027355.pt|and you try to find out the core where's
mels/004167.pt|in which case hell yes hell yeah brother crawl
mels/022875.pt|and screaming at the top of their lungs to a federal judge
mels/020766.pt|i bet you know it's lit it's so lit
mels/014643.pt|what the first market ones that i've never done a marketing wednesday i've never done a
mels/025489.pt|a little secret that comes out halfway through so let's watch it
mels/027709.pt|which is awesome overall cool app
mels/004804.pt|for whatever reason things stop he actually
mels/009607.pt|or should lose you gold if you kill them
mels/008563.pt|and everything he's requested they've sent
mels/031955.pt|key figure of the smash bros community and me and ludwig are his friends and we were invited to roast him this is also tough you may know who i pranked with a fake
mels/022514.pt|you know it's like all right but the end of the day does it look gross cause then we have another piece you know it's like all right but at the end of the day does it look gross
mels/009159.pt|three hours or whatever it'll be like it'll rank it by how many views it
mels/007795.pt|that's actually not a bad idea for 500k
mels/017598.pt|figure advertising company but they really have
mels/026061.pt|and struggling a group that's been
mels/022497.pt|we really roasted on previous marketing monday and that of course is burger king we really laid into burger king about
mels/011330.pt|it's all in just for a little bit thank
mels/019862.pt|the be neo the games were huge i mean the the
mels/022970.pt|realistically epic games had two years where they made absolute infinity
mels/026447.pt|if any other email people want to be
mels/025639.pt|i think about it that could work for everyone and if you're hungry right now
mels/024616.pt|but later that might be in in calling
mels/016358.pt|the the hundreds of billions of dollars a vast amount of
mels/005743.pt|it's almost like he was built in a lab to be a good just chatting streamer he
mels/002152.pt|i am not in conservative video
mels/015789.pt|just like they're like skeleton crew small operated services that
mels/005398.pt|in youtubers that featured ryan trahan
mels/020743.pt|i looked at a lot of ads
mels/018379.pt|it's and he owned the paid sites
mels/013456.pt|never stop the grind once married
mels/017872.pt|but they're not it's not their focus anymore
mels/003829.pt|it's concessions from the parties that win the election and it could lead to progress i do think the internet as a positive force for change could lead to something as something people could use to organize
mels/007141.pt|every single cough the whole flight i'm hearing like
mels/024642.pt|one portion of that of their giant growth in gdp has been real estate construction so like if you're a small city in china you can make more money just selling land to real estate developers than
mels/008256.pt|basically where you can sort of
mels/030534.pt|at one point we were all walking
mels/023682.pt|what i'm saying is the easiest way to get free likes
mels/020052.pt|nothing but make me really happy
mels/001862.pt|super excited and he's like i can't wait to make it happen and
mels/016777.pt|just a twitch boomer okay wait till i i'm
mels/018478.pt|i talk about that xbox mall they didn't get
mels/026176.pt|anyway that's one option the other
mels/002890.pt|if anybody has and it's a that's gonna cause him to have to
mels/022139.pt|in mailchimp and so like i didn't know what i was writing about yet so i just put
mels/008892.pt|boggles the mind and it's going to lead to him being in court like
mels/019758.pt|and most overhyped games of all time we're
mels/016361.pt|of america over the last two years the federal government approved a historic
mels/032229.pt|and let me tell you when you're doing it it feels different than when you're watching someone do
mels/007482.pt|is so i don't know if you guys know
mels/030692.pt|next day i'm at recess and i hear some some
mels/009780.pt|expecting to they have to hard cap temperatures in households so you can't have a temperature over like i
mels/024963.pt|it's was measured by negative comments about the brand on social media that's what it was okay for example one of the consistently most hated brands in the entire country is comcast people people that actually use the product consistently hate it because it's a dominant monopoly that overcharges and under delivers on service but
mels/026718.pt|we had all the mobile games number three of course game pass their major strategy and we've mentioned
mels/007824.pt|with the song and to do
mels/014121.pt|which are still by far the highest deals by the way i can't comment on specific deal numbers of anybody
mels/010899.pt|i'm also okay i don't know if i need to do i have to say
mels/002832.pt|well because if he can drag this uh
mels/031489.pt|that's how deep starcraft is there is no
mels/018196.pt|because people being afraid of pronouncing something is enough to deter them from even bringing it up if you're at a car
mels/012246.pt|so i'm furious but it's fine
mels/023777.pt|and it's a minute long this better be
mels/029329.pt|and then like they pointed out the guy
mels/030422.pt|i would have got a better one anywhere else she was literally like i'm gonna tell you this is honest she's like an older gal
mels/015667.pt|the safest bet though is probably disney because you can't really bet against the biggest movies in the world for the past 10 years
mels/009511.pt|this is a full-on route there are no
mels/002303.pt|with the next marketing monday maybe a targeting tuesday this week i don't know we're almost there i've been working on it it's
mels/018221.pt|if the the commercial which is crazy um
mels/028588.pt|this is the way back machine to the season two ladder back before they had
mels/000548.pt|you know we all have these
mels/010210.pt|i just asked my friend to do it so i could stream it on the internet
mels/006528.pt|we face on it right they
mels/017033.pt|i make sense that makes sense that makes
mels/028394.pt|write that down actually when i worked at twitch one of the big buzzwords was move the needle well that's not
mels/007419.pt|can i join in and then that's we have to do you
mels/006463.pt|it was like dystopia rebranded let's get to an actual fail let's get to actual fail and
mels/019189.pt|massive success Sega tried to go for
mels/007206.pt|one stage and i'm totally down i'll pay for your flight or flight for
mels/005616.pt|i do apologizing for it uh understandably
mels/031283.pt|he's not having any of it like he really the charm is not working but i can tell that like i'm truly pleading and i think he can feel this is not what he thought it was like this is not this is not a criminal something's going on here and then i find my in because he asked me how i got in he if he didn't ask me this i would have just it wouldn't it
mels/028023.pt|i regularly i give wins and fails updates
mels/002548.pt|or luck try to get a full aaa game perhaps or do you walk away with an easy
mels/030686.pt|and then we had a big
mels/013727.pt|do me i want only the most toxic to get
mels/007602.pt|it would be really cringe in person so i
mels/000599.pt|they have this scene where the entire
mels/028283.pt|stop and go to a little bit of
mels/031995.pt|i say it is the same
mels/022227.pt|goofing around walking along you know a
mels/024463.pt|in mind to talk about hearty
mels/007021.pt|well i've ever had it's so clean it matches the hat
mels/013612.pt|i know that everyone's already given a million hot takes today right
mels/019702.pt|well here is that he seems like he's way way way way way too nice and i'm so toxic and my community two things i i picked up from that
mels/024857.pt|is what you do this is how games like clash of clans make a lot of money this is how like hearthstone makes its money competitive advantage and this is what works on me okay then for
mels/003245.pt|a publicly traded company where individuals could buy stock in it and as the franchise grows these stocks become more valuable if this were the case someone who purchased
mels/027423.pt|but thankfully thankfully you know what
mels/006751.pt|we go together i love darman
mels/018101.pt|oh come on this makes me hate pepsi more than anything in the world i cannot believe
mels/002464.pt|like extreme purchasers and they would categorize people in that and they made
mels/007595.pt|was it fails are we do about the bigger i'm down from wins it fails all right we doing this no
mels/012040.pt|so powerful in the force so he turns it off
mels/024852.pt|we item they want to feel they want to fill that hole
mels/029401.pt|again i haven't planned and i call my mommy i call my mommy back in california and i
mels/020799.pt|while they did it pretty well there's funnier ads there's more emotional ads but i think that one felt truly nike while still being a powerful ad only barely edged out friends
mels/017467.pt|they were flooded with fake job applications by
mels/019568.pt|something for the client to say no to it's actually true it's always good to
mels/009254.pt|and so yeah we'll do a happy crunch miss kind of thing and i'll just buy a bunch of games for
mels/000313.pt|it'll blow it and saturday comes in and from
mels/012291.pt|so i'm playing my ass off
mels/032196.pt|or minimum you either bet banker or player you bet yes or no and then they just deal two hands of cards
mels/031783.pt|and what's changed but i think i'll summarize it by talking about the three horsemen of the apocalypse amaranth
mels/029263.pt|your honor yes i threw a brick through his window but big dig your honor
mels/020034.pt|because he thinks vr is the only thing that can break away from how much google owns phones this is
mels/014369.pt|hold their interest in marketing and launch on twitch because they were able to do drops and dominate the conversation
mels/015129.pt|okay this is working let's let's double down so this guy
mels/021940.pt|what that means is you can go back okay so stop stressing so much about it a business example uses like
mels/025054.pt|if i had to guess they say facebook is also huge hashtag delete facebook was trending and people try to get
mels/000629.pt|i was thinking through the whole thing it was like it was a real
mels/015733.pt|and it's applying to basically everybody but netflix and they're starting to freak out
mels/011782.pt|i didn't i didn't like look at spoilers or anything all i know
mels/006142.pt|now lyric by the way still gracious
mels/005397.pt|i learned that jarvis was formerly in a discord group for
mels/013633.pt|you're investing in the future of hulu
mels/012741.pt|people don't like that so they get mad
mels/032286.pt|it's all of our chips off
mels/024395.pt|these ads are pretty big waste of money i think if you feel like
mels/012167.pt|it's space poker and like they're having a space poker tournament
mels/011491.pt|the bit of a different thing where we don't
mels/030110.pt|he's a little bit mad that he had to go and get it on today and he's also a little bit
mels/006593.pt|a lot of people did actually end up seeing morbius because
mels/025595.pt|cut off her boss did she ask him a question
mels/015933.pt|it'll put her in the thumbnail and so you'll be like oh
mels/001554.pt|the should everyone knows we get a bonus question
mels/014171.pt|we can start to get over the audience does that
mels/028596.pt|okay so i got quite high but
mels/015529.pt|that makes them a lot of money okay if you're in the apple
mels/001276.pt|it's difficult wow we've done a lot okay look at all these game posters
mels/005918.pt|was the one that leaked or would recognize me or would know she was on stage
mels/029281.pt|today streams are all equally as big as ddp
mels/010604.pt|i gotta say this again later
mels/004104.pt|this was fine and nobody nobody there was no bad outcome
mels/017818.pt|so that's that thank you thank you for listening
mels/015141.pt|good enough book there is no limit to how far that can go
mels/001361.pt|he would play game let's play a game let's play a game
mels/032140.pt|his residency we don't have the money a
mels/018734.pt|it has amazing margins it makes a ton of
mels/022318.pt|or we could shut them all down
mels/026951.pt|it was the highest rated ad of the super bowl
mels/028623.pt|okay now uh it was quite a busy time at twitch i
mels/017286.pt|at stories begin here is edward
mels/015586.pt|they failed spectacularly it was one of the biggest dumpster fires in history they lost all
mels/018628.pt|the beginning i mean it's not the end it is the beginning microsoft is very likely going to spend more money to acquire more studios and more exclusives and try to get a completely unbeatable cloud gaming service
mels/009423.pt|dead wrong i think you have to understand that the newer a player is the difference between their best
mels/025944.pt|it's innovative in the same year this is overwatch league
mels/017458.pt|sort of putting their physical health at risk to take a stand against a corporation resonated quite
mels/009777.pt|living in germany expecting oh dude
mels/007797.pt|where i take off a dream mask that's
mels/006962.pt|it all adds up it all it's all
mels/017699.pt|users who have bought apple products have used
mels/023864.pt|this is another win this campaign from
mels/023127.pt|if there was a locust plague and the government was like
mels/024241.pt|not associate with microsoft at all it's not a
mels/022123.pt|what the people i hate to be that guy however these
mels/012373.pt|if you like he's not into it at all
mels/007422.pt|you can see it right here
mels/018932.pt|targeted at zoomers now i don't want to
mels/002545.pt|also need an answer quick tick tick tick tick
mels/021980.pt|okay somebody has to wake up early and stand off camera with a gun pointed at this woman
mels/018554.pt|weapon they have is game pass sony's trying to make
mels/014163.pt|it's like hey we'll give you a better
mels/012775.pt|pro team in college like this is when i'm grinding every day top of the ladder like like optimizing for i would do i would wake up and do like
mels/023766.pt|sketch where he's the one that doesn't know what's going on he's like trying to be normal
mels/001480.pt|on a stream and doesn't look at chat everybody looks at
mels/013902.pt|i had to watch it on stanz's tv which
mels/028203.pt|i get a lot of viewers on twitch
mels/013235.pt|i just wish they would do it
mels/029842.pt|his favorite way to wind down
mels/021270.pt|as and they're calling it views it's not real youtube has seen steady growth and growth at actually a faster rate than
mels/026349.pt|describing what it would look like if
mels/006227.pt|if you win flip it over
mels/023876.pt|this sucks because we were already
mels/031930.pt|know people could even like really notice us because i was in my own zone but they could and it was awkward and
mels/005881.pt|it'd be careful right because i don't want
mels/011646.pt|caribbean cruise do you know what i'm saying you can get like for
mels/018986.pt|was they didn't fundamentally understand how the phone attention span thing works they didn't understand about the second
mels/003139.pt|just a few years ago when kylie jenner i know
mels/008684.pt|if the people that have done m a uh
mels/019468.pt|and that is a sexy banana
mels/008247.pt|get a career and opportunity at twitch uh
mels/030049.pt|it's absolutely good thing because it's
mels/026124.pt|welcome welcome to marketing monday but first we open as always with some wins and fails in the past week of business
mels/007259.pt|i didn't want to do that so it's better that's my opinion but i don't think that's everybody's
mels/002806.pt|you guys ever had a long-term friend where you were so close you you had similar passions and interests and and times together and then you just
mels/007452.pt|and one of the people at
mels/031801.pt|him out of nowhere showing up amaranth
mels/003017.pt|and so we have no idea what's going on literally no idea what's going on
mels/024131.pt|why does every like did ninja
mels/015420.pt|these companies if you don't know are owned by disney hulu is not
mels/008361.pt|by yourself it's the hair i could be it
mels/003181.pt|and youtube and everything but it's killing facebook first and foremost and so
mels/015961.pt|because xbox game pass for pc sounded stupid but you know
mels/022834.pt|with him years later he said i'd like to forget it i almost didn't do this interview
mels/012190.pt|the show up here i'm already the latest person so i call ari and i'm like ari please get down there please ari we need you
mels/031028.pt|are from my tales and sf by the way
mels/014351.pt|is up both these companies and it's not about
mels/015290.pt|it's a massive massive market size they've tossed a lot of money at the problem
mels/025098.pt|large divisions in the country that cause extreme negative feelings about one brand or the other fox at number two and then number one and i'm surprised by this but this is again this is based on actual customer interviews employee satisfaction detail analytics yeah i mean this
mels/011573.pt|if the content cat now after stance farmed
mels/028774.pt|by the way they asked me what i was making now
mels/013252.pt|if anyone okay nobody on twitch makes it
mels/006656.pt|i might squeeze in balloons let's go
mels/016395.pt|we have existed to benefit either either
mels/028614.pt|dude when i joined twitch everyone was playing league at the office a lot and i was like i'm the best player at twitch i'm the
mels/020669.pt|well over here and the award goes to
mels/026924.pt|think it'd be higher of the of the mid tier
mels/017650.pt|so if you look at google search volume apple store near me is more popular than supermarket near me haircut near me convenience store near me and often especially lately church near me they're i mean they're like temples they
mels/011826.pt|worse now so everything's all star wars and it gives you like the map of the ship and it gives you like
mels/007168.pt|soft you know open but i do think that
mels/005713.pt|like a public mall we're like on
mels/028493.pt|why don't get yelled at but i
mels/012239.pt|we're really late we're running very late i showed up late
mels/005252.pt|you know like let's do it again this part is
mels/003279.pt|in spain both day and night
mels/002066.pt|but i'll get really into jesus
mels/003069.pt|jump into something else the problem is here's the problem
mels/002167.pt|we should research them find his or her
mels/013449.pt|his roommate would know that he already can't leave and his
mels/017731.pt|as rewards um so overall in some you can
mels/004068.pt|and months brando i can't believe we finally gave
mels/012019.pt|i think of the biggest minus the biggest minus from the first day was
mels/006102.pt|even one i don't like he
mels/001041.pt|bachelor party invitation might have got lost in the
mels/025153.pt|get a taste of the new flow this is so weird because
mels/002178.pt|for all five people in the interview and i got the job okay so i don't regret it one bit
mels/007199.pt|i found out from someone else that he was too shy he was too shy so i i think it was
mels/016659.pt|age and it wasn't growing nearly as fast so
mels/025962.pt|as like year and a half these are all
mels/015940.pt|all my thumbnails on netflix are guns
mels/027840.pt|people don't want to invest in a company that owes a lot of money has no plan to get
mels/028974.pt|so i took this back to my dorm room and i stared at it just like just give it a stare down dude
mels/011469.pt|someone else in my program did uh
mels/006704.pt|and i said it's no problem i said
mels/028481.pt|my dad is his superior officer
mels/030194.pt|he got like i fell backwards
mels/010498.pt|well rushed um i really want another season it's the
mels/012615.pt|oh yeah on the way out
mels/005448.pt|you know really put on a smile for the
mels/023663.pt|at me by a lot they bought bitcoin america
mels/010846.pt|no singed the most cringe champ
mels/015036.pt|who had this no late fees remember that the the blockbuster killer i wonder
mels/027323.pt|the game sold millions of copies but most of those millions never beat the game what that creates with
mels/027311.pt|but i think is the the downside you know this is
mels/032208.pt|it was we were all gonna
mels/007649.pt|a cool thumbnail check out my thumbnail
mels/012734.pt|but not get extra money or promotion or or anything
mels/029325.pt|because i had gone to worlds and bought the merch so i'm wearing like a
mels/015541.pt|it has no real adoption none of their shows have reached
mels/023658.pt|of dollars in federal income taxes and actually received
mels/024491.pt|oh they did and i'm gonna
mels/017144.pt|the deal it's part of the wheeling
mels/025038.pt|like they don't have cheese or something i'm not sure what it is but they make it different and it tastes way worse what is canada
mels/022481.pt|what the stairs we get a lot of smokes
mels/015666.pt|keep you stuck in prime these are good business models
mels/010477.pt|they also kind of like ride with my vibe and do it anyway so there's no actual solution except for to ignore it completely from the beginning which is too late it's too late they're either problem facing and doing
mels/032392.pt|i don't want to make a youtube video about this
mels/023333.pt|second win is the following i
mels/011865.pt|one more thing that i don't
mels/023172.pt|with grill marks painted on and you can
mels/004385.pt|is that you are right here i will rightfully pay you that is a guarantee i am guaranteeing
mels/009904.pt|go down you probably would go complain people are just like
mels/005327.pt|i thought there was like security right it's like
mels/018572.pt|now neither side are flopping out of the
mels/000815.pt|there but like i didn't get the either i got
mels/021653.pt|is this canon cause like i i i run a a fan fiction webpage is this i need to
mels/025520.pt|again doing extremely well with the
mels/003277.pt|are they caused in the last month so theoretically they can go for a third chance and that's awesome it's forgiveness okay yes two in a month but in their defense
mels/003513.pt|world there are many things that are going in the right direction
mels/019817.pt|this is a spreadsheet of all the things they probably this
mels/012681.pt|a person in real life and not get banned from wow after the
mels/016983.pt|as we enter a possible global
mels/008769.pt|twitter has the upper hand this legal
mels/025283.pt|the ride in a movie and um
mels/009863.pt|if the in europe for for quite a few years and i got to see you know the pros and cons and the differences and
mels/010979.pt|is not even going to the cinema but renting us
mels/012263.pt|yeah here it is like the like in the in the in the in the previous round we were playing with
mels/021897.pt|is boring okay but the general idea is it's like a wheel where everything on the wheel makes the next thing easier and it should loop back to the original thing that's the idea i think like this all the time for a lot of things and i'm
mels/012039.pt|if the four and a half minutes
mels/027844.pt|targets of the everything bubble popping it's going to be though it seems to be
mels/011479.pt|because the creative director had a crush on her moved across the crunchy and broke up with me because the creative director had a crush on her moved across the country and broke up with me
mels/012685.pt|put out first and then i can go do some more
mels/031791.pt|in the thick the lines are between minecraft
mels/027414.pt|that the free version exists in fact they
mels/003781.pt|it was a pretty good climate change bill
mels/030540.pt|watch i never take i needed that but her dad uh brought
mels/017862.pt|is not infrequent there's infrequent updates the developers don't give you
mels/022662.pt|it just works do you want to meet ron in
mels/019766.pt|under hype is is irrelevance no one buys it overhype means people
mels/022095.pt|the early days of social so here's what happened originally a pastor came into an applebee's and instead of tipping his waitress after a meal he had
mels/014311.pt|at all levels and it incentivizes people to start
mels/027833.pt|the burning cash so if you're ever looking at a balance sheet probably the most important thing to take a look at every time is free cash flow if you see a company that has positive free cash flow
mels/018055.pt|this is human beings trapped in a fire needing first aid pepsi man's whole shtick is that he goes to vending machines that are empty and fills them up so you can get more pepsi these people do not need pepsi pepsi man your antics will only
mels/002978.pt|jordan peele is a genius he's showing
mels/028732.pt|axel these jobs and i'm not going to
mels/002003.pt|if they're just not like they're not a massive investment and you can make a ton of money
mels/028720.pt|and they're like oh yeah let's check it out
mels/021963.pt|we get better at editing and
mels/006115.pt|if the counter pop off is like the most nine head maneuver
mels/016026.pt|why we did the marketing monday i thank you
mels/007240.pt|and i was like bro so there's two options when he said that the first one is like um excuse me put
mels/031104.pt|he'll make more than us combined i remember saying that and that was back when he had like no viewers and that's not something you say about somebody that's going to be
mels/021179.pt|where i believe millennials are hitting their prime so on the left you can see what advertisers and news articles think millennials look like on the right you can see what you guys think millennials look like and
mels/002651.pt|it's a win potentially infinite dollars who will take home this incredible prize this phenomenal prize by the way thank you for the five months ceo of
mels/023671.pt|in the drywall won't stop screaming at us i
mels/020924.pt|we is make it to the lcs be in a season or two and then get
mels/013454.pt|hidden from when you're under 18 the
mels/010589.pt|the world's in chaos this country is
mels/017897.pt|at the farm i broke my leg straight down 21
mels/015156.pt|the most google thing ever i think it was so successful that yeah it was successful it was
mels/028603.pt|i thought i made the whole thing up they got super
mels/004708.pt|of the one month anniversary of the time i spent
mels/024179.pt|not for just the biggest sizes the only thing i think twitch really has that's unbeatable right now is prime if prime goes away or if youtube finds a counter
mels/017024.pt|go back to school today which is the
mels/012391.pt|i know this was coming but
mels/031281.pt|going to call the police i really really really like turn on everything i've got in all of my
mels/015539.pt|apple tv is is by far
mels/024894.pt|i have ever read the book thinking fast and slow it's a great book i would recommend checking it out but the main idea
mels/014850.pt|is that you own and make your game popular the real problem larger than this is that ubisoft's games
mels/010932.pt|and a limited edition minions cheese
mels/027820.pt|and retail investors which is what you and i are average people not hedge funds or big
mels/022876.pt|the court could not properly mute all
mels/031800.pt|we crushing it and so between
mels/017629.pt|would be on someone else's terms it would be
mels/011343.pt|yeah that was one of the
mels/021800.pt|act together and then the great people at the jeep corporation to save this great country with the most powerful
mels/017405.pt|it's right there it's just one of the images and because it looks similar enough the people writing just
mels/004474.pt|and then i'll get on my scooter and
mels/001374.pt|and join the you know i'll just
mels/020312.pt|be something in it and you guys will spam that person should die we can't not we
mels/017580.pt|of itself but that model has changed the world of marketing has changed
mels/009444.pt|in a good chunk of damage from tyler1
mels/012960.pt|i was like people use grad school to ride out
mels/011813.pt|what are they not break character they are actively in character the entire time they yeah
mels/017493.pt|there's going to be back and forth and up and down but hopefully the
mels/023639.pt|big corporations doing it to where it's like okay even if you're an
mels/026773.pt|what of businesses that relied on uh ad
mels/002447.pt|example customers so you'll like say this is jeff he's
mels/025618.pt|and immediately roblox went down but i
mels/017724.pt|well users please don't forget that a green bubble is a real person the green and blue bubble
mels/011711.pt|go through a checkpoint and we go into like this prison
mels/016136.pt|get to see all good to see you all
mels/003247.pt|book would be a billionaire now what a ridiculous and stupid example by
mels/027367.pt|well that really summed it up for me that it
mels/023458.pt|you can raise this and then you can get fat margins okay now the second part of this is market share the difference between price and perceived value and
mels/004282.pt|whatsapp what's up what's up what's
mels/022067.pt|or to tell unless you check the little tiny
mels/015984.pt|and that's what game pass is
mels/010664.pt|i on learning and if you're
mels/024971.pt|the bad sony product so let me give you an
mels/031050.pt|i mean i don't know i don't
mels/023707.pt|i can't help you i can't help you it's that that i thought it was fake too but it's got
mels/010372.pt|i takes us you know i went live on time
mels/001096.pt|it's and parties and started a club and it was fun and then at the summer break after freshman year i got into a little game called league of legends and so really freshman
mels/031363.pt|ryan seacrest with a spray tan i had a pretty fun birthday and i'm here to tell you about it
mels/000195.pt|it's coming my brother is the most fun gambler in the world he's a
mels/026082.pt|to get the image you go to google images and unfortunately when they went to google images and searched
mels/002804.pt|if the for once holy moly we're gonna kick
mels/027925.pt|i want to give a third win to the lost art
mels/028181.pt|like their revenue like their profit like their chances of survival
mels/018888.pt|i love watching I love talking about ads and I
mels/023430.pt|you have a lot more energy and people want to be around you more and low energy just sucks circumstances but i i would say for most people that i
mels/029177.pt|to the game i i'll say it i was against
mels/005256.pt|knows me which again is fine which again is fine but they don't know me okay they don't know me it's like it's
mels/003442.pt|is are very high in taiwan uh i have no more information
mels/021094.pt|just like we do and this is the white and gold dress that caused the civil war but most amazing of all are the avocados
mels/013122.pt|as what really gives me the fuel i need to succeed
mels/000228.pt|we're talking about the future and i haven't caught up with lorenzo in
mels/006000.pt|i played mail with him and i thought that
mels/018627.pt|what i'm trying to say to you is if microsoft believes in this strategy
mels/000222.pt|it's arrive and i have a sip and it's the
mels/020291.pt|i yeah uh yeah let's let's lock that in it
mels/000173.pt|and we're missing one of our friends
mels/029861.pt|your house first of all you
mels/008739.pt|as sorry and twitter forgives him
mels/025429.pt|gambit style a viewer i'm glad one of you was watching average jonas in your spare time hello from paris that i miss gambit style a truck viewer i'm glad one of you was watching average jonas in
mels/004692.pt|get excited and having a good day and ready into a good weekend i truly mean that you know
mels/015391.pt|every warner brothers movie day and date same as theatrical release online okay so when dune comes out in theaters you can instead watch it as it's meant
mels/031061.pt|what he was like kind of
mels/002217.pt|we don't belong here too he said some of
mels/029436.pt|look a little office chair to the side of his desk like a dwight and he's talking to me he's like yo
mels/028612.pt|upon joining twitch this is all story
mels/021447.pt|and and at the end of the day gamestop stock is not worth this much that is the core thing that's the reason i didn't do it we're all just trying to be the first one out we're trying to hold it long
mels/027166.pt|it's all starting to hit right now do you think this will increase the
mels/008444.pt|seven or eight i was on you know little league soccer i was like you know played as a kid and apparently
mels/014966.pt|sign up in the link below
mels/027073.pt|they'd show a cute animal climbing down to the forest floor to eat a dorito and then
mels/011884.pt|it's scope and scale of some of the things and like it didn't feel like i was
mels/023983.pt|they are stupid for other reasons that
mels/029514.pt|it was their whole life mission
mels/000888.pt|how about i pick someone else
mels/007463.pt|had never lost a set to marth
mels/016041.pt|i might not be live for a few days because i
mels/009823.pt|finally europe's way ahead of us on buying electric cars
mels/000821.pt|now that we spent was worth it was worth it
mels/028960.pt|but mostly me and i don't know any of them they weren't part of my friend group so
mels/027872.pt|we to buy calls on this stock uh
mels/031770.pt|you know the lore because if there's a
mels/026806.pt|we can't track data on ios and apple still can apple's advertising business is
mels/012444.pt|in order i think you got general written all over you the way you've been
mels/003906.pt|the that the democratic side um
mels/000325.pt|it's like you have an actual gun and you can move it was pretty sick it was it was like one of the better vr experience i've ever done because it feels really cool
mels/017165.pt|one more run to make up for their egregious
mels/009628.pt|and years you'll beat me bro people used to
mels/014824.pt|so only a few weeks later they
mels/029421.pt|or something it was like yo i'm sorry i'm not sure i
mels/031740.pt|disney was okay disney's trying to get and get their hands on everything the name
mels/016714.pt|way to reduce commutes and let people live farther away and still get to the
mels/025293.pt|it's the same win it's netflix
mels/013715.pt|i want to give him a dub for this because i looked
mels/032329.pt|by the way i've completed both i'm i
mels/012921.pt|and like what does that mean for money like
mels/009256.pt|the with the nine months dark crescent over the two
mels/023831.pt|monday marketing monday marketing monday now
mels/028068.pt|on each one of those it
mels/003240.pt|your readers i assume there's maybe one of you among the five thousand i'm sure
mels/029501.pt|good the gods were when he you know the friend of the producer famous scene
mels/004654.pt|i'm a lot excited for the weekend you know a busy week and all that blah
mels/026563.pt|it sticks to his guns and doesn't sell and just
mels/032204.pt|watch then then we get greedy we're so confident we're so up we go to a
mels/003546.pt|i grew up on dumerism as
mels/032207.pt|yet but we're all up like two three four grand if we just take this money and double up tonight and
mels/008449.pt|so you're taking the piss okay that's okay there's no chance even if you're not paying attention it's very obvious which side's the goal
mels/009975.pt|that means you got an open seat and
mels/008565.pt|is higher than five percent and even if it is higher than five percent which he hasn't shown the evidence
mels/013450.pt|that's funny that's funny that's funny that's funny that's
mels/007410.pt|i walk around this tournament you know i know i know people i know a lot of the faces but there's a ton of new people there's a ton of slippy kids that are coming up
mels/018947.pt|one marketing and as a marketer i hate that i want people to spend
mels/013904.pt|i want to poor shame stands but his tv is
mels/031876.pt|it's been huge so like if you want to look at the past month on twitch that's the stories now if only clint stevens has streamed
mels/011859.pt|is that you have your own space because you
mels/026060.pt|he needs it though can i just give a win for a second to someone who's been
mels/008421.pt|those was finally one find me one find me an
mels/018522.pt|was going to do is not make their own they're going to buy studios and then and then
mels/015416.pt|and so they're kind of upset about it so it's
mels/012709.pt|you're playing and it's just drip feeding you new gear new stats new level
mels/029035.pt|little bit i guess ah you don't go back and i'm like whoa little bit like this you know i go back and i'm like oh what
mels/013323.pt|and i can't throw you very far
mels/030944.pt|words the blank space like i do you're right singing the first verse for
mels/014659.pt|can you do one right now
mels/018372.pt|you feel better about your job but if your job yeah quantifiable your job needs to be quantifiable in
mels/005721.pt|so but yeah he had also headed to like
mels/030099.pt|the gimmick of this game in
mels/023646.pt|that's crazy yeah i was reading about the history of billboards and marketing and because i had the same question i
mels/014488.pt|what's next the last thing is what's next and for that i have
mels/012847.pt|a year i mean a year plus i
mels/011025.pt|that possibly mean what the hell could that mean sounds like some sort of secret code
mels/028765.pt|is a recruiter the way she said it and i'm older and wiser now was
mels/012185.pt|and i'm like please let me enter please
mels/022559.pt|to users to remind them to practice practice
mels/016958.pt|code it's a very cool app i recommend it they've been very supportive marketing monday and i do appreciate it
mels/019596.pt|ban them quack can you find them stupidest thing i've
mels/005533.pt|quit balling i started working at twitch and then all my friends became gamer nerds
mels/029376.pt|he's got a lot there's people that
mels/028159.pt|the big question here is what are they spending the money on how are they spending 80 million dollars and i looked
mels/018597.pt|i decided yet here's the actual answer is i can't predict it because they haven't
mels/028538.pt|i only hope and i don't know if that got through to
mels/020276.pt|if the product which is usually a huge no-no but i think it actually makes the ad because you get the joke so quickly
mels/028788.pt|and she pauses for a second there's like this very long silence it's just a few
mels/031608.pt|sleep on the floor like they just play
mels/029604.pt|the old mall and built a new
mels/023992.pt|these money to grow you go to these big outside investors hedge funds rich people and you get millions of dollars and they get a cut of your company outside investors in general some of them were scared off by only fans being adult content focused later that day after that report comes out the company out of the blue sort of abruptly announces that it's going to prohibit users from
mels/028027.pt|with tons of views in fact i'll give a win
mels/032347.pt|what's the situation that i chose
mels/018117.pt|actually hate this part for real because it doesn't make any sense
mels/001048.pt|the bread and butter dota streams isn't it crazy how this stream was originally
mels/025257.pt|exclusive first leak clip from the movie
mels/000791.pt|if the one thousand and i say look i want to pay i got i
mels/019334.pt|people who want like an expensive laptop for flights the workhorse market people who use laptops every single day and then the
mels/008640.pt|i can just basically do it for any kind of pretext it
mels/031699.pt|with the question like hey have
mels/019343.pt|compute u was going for workhorse and
mels/026611.pt|i get dunked on social so they always pay so you know they're probably not going
mels/015671.pt|better at making content for whatever reason they can make
mels/009799.pt|says that our country may be headed for the worst economic crisis since the founding of the federal republic of germany frederick
mels/005621.pt|at all i wanted was for a friend of mine's
mels/005806.pt|i have ever since because as a friend as a person
mels/020461.pt|in the past and made money what is it
mels/027864.pt|going down the thing is great companies amazon for example apple these are
mels/011810.pt|it's cool and then i get to meet the actors and i'm gonna give you the second plus the second plus and probably the biggest plus of the entire thing is that there is a series of actors who
mels/023548.pt|you killed taxis a lot of cities don't even have
mels/001497.pt|population you're going to argue with me
mels/016121.pt|this past few weeks have been um
mels/010538.pt|bring the whole team together um it's just not something that you're
mels/012014.pt|the first day because again there's like
mels/018363.pt|if the deeper problems i mean it's all about leverage
mels/018500.pt|a year in net income this is not like people i think that don't know the console wars think that microsoft and sony are similar sized companies and they are not it is not close microsoft's yearly income would not fit
mels/028663.pt|it's all diamonds okay basically all these jewels i buy a bunch of those i go to work now at 11 probably
mels/027850.pt|if there's entertainment oh man that's that's
mels/008975.pt|two people so since the deal has been signed to now twitter fired two big executives
mels/003532.pt|that would be unadvised cars are very
mels/009189.pt|and again that that level of i give obviously a
mels/012582.pt|you got four dollars of disney or whatever whatever and so i was doing
mels/030127.pt|where i'm still a kid that loves the game the next day my dad comes down
mels/005075.pt|is that he's good at which i think tesla is a
mels/020414.pt|flash forward 20 minutes and this
mels/000070.pt|that's that's fine we'll take that
mels/031531.pt|feel like because half the game is micro like
mels/018834.pt|at and his wife smiling at him and he looks at it and his
mels/019318.pt|at glasses he was a little nerdy but he was smart okay i liked his energy okay he had good energy and so me and jason
mels/004106.pt|i started as an nvidia intern today
mels/025276.pt|every single one of those combined does not add up to the popularity of squid games and
mels/024842.pt|we're all let's say we've all started um
mels/002481.pt|for parties what is that what does that mean squeak to that
mels/014599.pt|from they would never do a like a broadcaster
mels/026691.pt|if the and remember thinking was really stupid now
mels/014042.pt|would try he is a streamer streamer he's an influencers influencer
mels/003689.pt|that moment you start to see changes
mels/011728.pt|let me tell you let me tell you see these guys in blue so this is important there is two types of staff at the galactic star cruiser that i that we stayed at
mels/001990.pt|well they wouldn't be too different you know
mels/016254.pt|into score tweet from the laker social media
mels/014911.pt|he must have made a lot of money off
mels/032373.pt|it five times straight easy easy easy and then i would get into the
mels/008932.pt|using my own logic my own judgment looking at
mels/020843.pt|that i've heard in a long time powerful advice that i think inspired me when i read it
mels/002780.pt|it'd be really tired but it'll be worth it because i think we want to do it before
mels/024673.pt|for one human being to know all the different domino
mels/019671.pt|wait so they've asked you to do these for like corporate meetings like that they oh that's awesome after you
mels/025087.pt|well cheated by the education they receive and their ability to get a job after graduation they feel like they've been scammed out of their money and
mels/001342.pt|i don't use cars primitive technology
mels/012948.pt|over the next year and a half of all time and
mels/030028.pt|and i said yeah he's like
mels/032404.pt|in freak out and then you give it twice
mels/015996.pt|i every star wars movie every marvel movie every
mels/013852.pt|if the threats and this includes all of us as gamers every threat
mels/009973.pt|and here's why i should be a contender
mels/020466.pt|a little bit buggy there's a lot of reasons
mels/017492.pt|if the for me this week was the success of the kellogg's strike
mels/015211.pt|new path forward number of languages supported netflix
mels/016922.pt|that's great universities are worth it now
mels/018569.pt|and so xbox won that one

mels/009694.pt|more quincy w today no not playing any balloons but i will say that i ordered
mels/016385.pt|and then they blame things like the paychecks to every person the the
mels/008494.pt|i don't know about big brand content
mels/018159.pt|hurry before the iconic baseline kicks
mels/031514.pt|it's like you send out a guy and
mels/032034.pt|you don't smoke weed all day
mels/004792.pt|is committed to closing the transaction on
mels/027191.pt|we hired uh coder at fromsoft
mels/014124.pt|big company was getting into this they didn't understand how this market worked and it was assumed that if you bought the biggest people their audience would transfer over it was proven very quickly but not after all these guys got their bag
mels/026962.pt|but with these goggles you can enjoy a fake version of the world you remembered
mels/025253.pt|and please look forward to mario as performed by the very talented chris if next princess peach but he played by and and please look forward to mario as performed by the very talented chris son next princess peach will be played by
mels/020520.pt|there's a lot of developers out there and the only way you get

mels/003259.pt|will get in early enough for this to
mels/003332.pt|and they're seeing forward progress at some major companies
mels/000679.pt|i think we have some photos let me see okay yeah i'll show you
mels/007418.pt|it's just it's it's you have to be comfortable walking up to a setup
mels/009198.pt|in the first we're gonna do a lot of stuff it's a pretty big saturday we're
mels/000834.pt|yeah he's like yeah and then one day i decided i would hire a bunch of people in my fake family
mels/023801.pt|the sports fans sports fans love them
mels/030580.pt|that i don't know what kahoot is and you
mels/023667.pt|day we're supposed to arrive and then

mels/007969.pt|one tomorrow i'm excited about it it'll be good
mels/009217.pt|what's that everybody wants to blame their team and they
mels/031435.pt|mine was that i had perfect spirals with great velocity that always went above your head all of my shots went above your head
mels/000012.pt|i think he just looks only at me and everyone else
mels/007733.pt|drop to your door knock on it twice dance a little jig and then
mels/001367.pt|if the thing and then i was gonna give you
mels/019760.pt|now from a marketing pov let's go into a
mels/022677.pt|in dollars for a lot of furry porn that's that's essentially it so
mels/018712.pt|if we lose this console war we've got no
mels/000830.pt|i don't really know your history you how did you get into doing all the weird stuff you're doing like when
mels/006624.pt|oh my god i was this close to buying the
mels/010285.pt|is apparently about apparently he walked around with photos of me and
mels/008455.pt|we'll think about young enough soccer i mean if you're like little league age they can't make it to the goal goalie or not
mels/017957.pt|it's up with what's up what's up
mels/014794.pt|we will be doing a couple
mels/020695.pt|what was this this won so many awards
mels/006597.pt|i don't think it's gonna lead
mels/005540.pt|where i got like hey congratulations congrats congrats on the wedding i know that i couldn't get a seat but
mels/008931.pt|but it's going to play well with the court and i think they're i think i mean i
mels/015763.pt|black widow right and it wasn't that successful wasn't black widow's same day
mels/006229.pt|flip the table and leave either way they'll be talking about you
mels/021535.pt|even if we get them it's
mels/021606.pt|it out of his child's mouth when he kisses him on it is working so i
mels/026312.pt|if the things they've done but the key thing that's
mels/003268.pt|what cut can i get yeah i
mels/026369.pt|and of users who have bought apple products
mels/006784.pt|with the basketball i'm not gonna go
mels/005277.pt|where people are all loudly talking to each
mels/031156.pt|it must be really killing him and it's like bro the people that were saying that uh type people that stay up
mels/023073.pt|the get it okay so marketing is not going to affect very much what i buy
mels/021695.pt|but we can give you a free t-shirt
mels/019063.pt|you know it's like that's the difference is love
mels/027291.pt|is why wouldn't you just add like who does it hurt
mels/006448.pt|where every one of my friends and family
mels/004482.pt|interesting line of thought i feel like
mels/025956.pt|in the lower and there is no near-term
mels/025975.pt|this presentation with this a website that went up on riot games
mels/026280.pt|well banner ads etc and yet they've built a brand stronger than anyone
mels/013491.pt|i think if i was still like i was when i played league
mels/012221.pt|at the event whatever we're facing off and we get a i
mels/003405.pt|and piece of news that i'd
mels/018538.pt|it's like twitch with amazon prime it's it's like or twitch prime i'm sorry twitch does
mels/030963.pt|that's good you should open every
mels/009352.pt|i know that comment um the
mels/024319.pt|or in michigan and i think that makes sense i think the problem here is that this ad is very
mels/016154.pt|watching a movie did you hear about will smith slapping
mels/023245.pt|it was more unhealthy than jolly rancher
mels/013534.pt|all the new employees that were like in or around his team would like invite them to do like uh you know just a
mels/016113.pt|what is left to do today do i wrap here is there anything
mels/011907.pt|in khakis in a shirt or something worse
mels/002127.pt|well party four hours ago today a big third party just get voted and
mels/021600.pt|accounting reports that were completely made up saying
mels/020177.pt|never forget hey you know what never
mels/000305.pt|night two is where the real magic
mels/027551.pt|it's in the company um but
mels/000236.pt|that you're celebrating and that's my brother so it's all of us against my
mels/028675.pt|two years later in the peak of the amazon era you would be fired obviously you can't
mels/004357.pt|we're in that you thought your best way to contribute in chat to our conversation was to put the bee emoji
mels/031687.pt|so i made up a fake esoteric anime that
mels/003631.pt|and it's dated on a certain time period that
mels/022261.pt|you must be hungry fuel up on campus chunky soup wow
mels/005316.pt|if the women we were talking a lot it was a
mels/029742.pt|and then cut to bed as w interview yeah
mels/029524.pt|we'd all of them but then you actually go and look at the people ranked
mels/029746.pt|at the strings he decides who he
mels/025794.pt|if the best rated show ever and now
mels/015484.pt|are losing so much money they're losing so much money when they give it all to you on disney plus and
mels/000052.pt|whereas i guess we'll get to that i'm assuming no marketing money this week are you kidding me are you kidding me of course i worked on marketing monday
mels/030335.pt|if you can do a lot with this i mean this is like the end of world war ii yeah
mels/016467.pt|oh my god it couldn't be more appropriate
mels/025884.pt|worry about sexist culture how do they handle
mels/006952.pt|don't know this they call us millennials because
mels/005539.pt|and the more drunk they got the more i
mels/029502.pt|the right where they just show like there's levels here right and scar talks about it in this dock he
mels/002533.pt|with the show at any moment
mels/010428.pt|i thought about who's my guests
mels/002814.pt|though there is plenty of evidence both from the wall street journal and other reputable sources that says not only did he do it but that he publicly
mels/012000.pt|with a little bit of a boys
mels/027268.pt|and they do things differently they have different
mels/025672.pt|got you out of your comfort zone or one that made you feel scared those two things activated the same thing but it turns out you could activate the fear one
mels/024144.pt|which contracts because twitch was threatened
mels/009275.pt|harder balloons boss i think it's gone i wanted
mels/023659.pt|the rebate from the government yeah
mels/025679.pt|to get that deep psychological response but you don't want the risk of something like this you go for a more spooky
mels/010476.pt|and alternatively if i said i did want
mels/005567.pt|my understanding is that hassan stayed back after everyone else left and
mels/013409.pt|they should have called chris chris would have done a better job
mels/002055.pt|somebody heard it she basically said that she changed her dating app to say i
mels/013722.pt|i think money and making new accounts he had a
mels/030654.pt|the from school so he i see him in the back and he's starting to
mels/016737.pt|and i think if they continue to make progress and
mels/015879.pt|what i'm starting my own streaming services
mels/023281.pt|or what but she was able i couldn't do it
mels/009218.pt|this game they're working on is going to have a ton of co-op modes a ton of like
mels/011747.pt|are you ready for your voyage and and then they'll be like what's your
mels/029725.pt|you know yeah oh i feel like
mels/016195.pt|get a good rapport going play the song
mels/012479.pt|it was cheer for kroy and then rey
mels/015322.pt|if the for free to keep that going and so that makes them unique in all streamers because they can spend a lot more money and not care and so speaking of a lot more money this is a quote from a deep dive on their new show
mels/019737.pt|the computer but i don't suck movies and it's like
mels/022416.pt|it's just these are just good it's creative the kid's breaking very very good very
mels/006700.pt|of times i never showed youtube once it was only gameplay and then when i finally got it after six hours i did a hulu plug
mels/015205.pt|and peacock in the united states only so if you're netflix and
mels/024594.pt|important character was free to be himself to be the banana man he always
mels/013937.pt|whatever they call them because they use a lot of
mels/029980.pt|was for sure you were number one
mels/025677.pt|the shock value ad was memorable where
mels/010369.pt|maybe explain how she got this cat
mels/007704.pt|you should divorce your girl to pursue your career
mels/020029.pt|i hope there's people that are not in a deep online war over what mobile ios you lose
mels/023917.pt|i will get so hyped watching like football right and i i first felt it when i watched mango in tournament when i was
mels/029434.pt|trying to make it in the gaming industry i'm
mels/025805.pt|and the responses were unanimous for blizzard this guy worked it both and he
mels/009376.pt|i have absolutely nothing they can play then you focus everything you have on farming them yeah
mels/010552.pt|the through it league of legends is an addiction and it's
mels/005004.pt|the the retaining talent so those are three outcomes i don't know which way it'll go i honestly don't i think in a normal world based on how things have normally gone and on the spirit of the law the more i've looked into it the more it's like pretty obvious he just made a bad call he made a bad business move but he signed on the dotted line and
mels/027601.pt|i got fooled by a pool ball seven
mels/004914.pt|that much money we should take it we should all take it and so they did the problem is they didn't know that
mels/007657.pt|you are relentless bro you're relentless it was one time
mels/001857.pt|and then i'm like okay and
mels/000366.pt|lose again double or nothing so by the way so we do
mels/026328.pt|i thought about shifting your money from here to here verizon spends a lot of money here
mels/020849.pt|he starts off by saying i've gotten a lot of bad advice in my
mels/029839.pt|apple tournaments we would all go to
mels/007949.pt|and sir not all of them were at my expense
mels/031963.pt|i feel like crazy for almost all the jokes but it
mels/018192.pt|very simple problem all you remember from this ad
mels/026554.pt|how do you make this tweet and then five
mels/025610.pt|is now alphabet so what does that leave us with
mels/006510.pt|yeah as long as i pay on time there's
mels/005445.pt|maybe he doesn't have teeth that's one possible explanation
mels/019179.pt|in public and the people at large basically revolted and the
mels/030232.pt|anyway yeah actual children this is mango
mels/028217.pt|good articles oh man you're so great just talking all
mels/017562.pt|the past to be sure but in fact if you look at it this is how much apple spent on advertising less than a billion dollars versus samsung
mels/022041.pt|thought they were being clever and
mels/022424.pt|we use a lot of the same kinds of programs
mels/014645.pt|to be talking about marketing not on the
mels/018354.pt|always get to the phase where they're like right there where they they see you in the job
mels/006051.pt|you know what i'm saying it's like it sounds it's crazy it's it's
mels/018918.pt|shrek kung fu panda monsters vs aliens okay he had been involved in these but you know what he found a partner he found a partner who knows business in and out a partner who'd never failed
mels/023384.pt|or something no i don't because those nobody wants to watch
mels/003919.pt|i don't like biden running or bush's son running or
mels/024537.pt|i mean that did get through this is the one pierce in apple's armor
mels/013329.pt|no it wasn't auto otto did not make me a
mels/004292.pt|and i'm sure it will reveal that i am correct
mels/006355.pt|to fully upgrade your character and you know what people who
mels/001486.pt|yeah it's just silent got it
mels/001882.pt|title because it feels way too
mels/004696.pt|one second wait what's your take on who that denying the penis man allegations i don't have a take on that one haven't
mels/019257.pt|this is like one of the first really big viral game memes giant enemy crab
mels/017618.pt|is one of the big many things they've done but uh the
mels/011984.pt|like an engineering room that i got sent to on a mission and it's like locked like if you go there on your own and try to open it it'll be locked but if you talk to kroy or she
mels/029344.pt|that was pretty cool and so
mels/029143.pt|so i i i said oh you know of course i gave
mels/006017.pt|what i wanted to say i wanted to say is that
mels/030811.pt|war it was like it's a free a free fish game and once i found that fish game i did not spend another second looking at fish here it
mels/014303.pt|people are just less hesitant to use
mels/027596.pt|it's gonna make things better i think more realistically he is trying to get exit on truth shut down truth make some money i
mels/020931.pt|us basically your profit are thin in a competitive industry you don't make very much fat margin
mels/029192.pt|during this day there were a whopping
mels/021154.pt|cause i hadn't heard about this but apparently this has a lot of nostalgia be safe around trains it was a mobile game with a fun ad and people liked it
mels/024592.pt|just a banana man he is fully capable of
mels/005374.pt|i was waving at you and then he starts telling everyone around the worst possible outcome he starts telling everyone around dude i was waving at this guy and he keeps
mels/006897.pt|and a culture it was a short for your first meeting chemicals are so i don't think i really i lived at work and a culture it was a show up for your first meeting kind of culture so i i don't
mels/004967.pt|be related to my biological father in any way shape or form i don't know by the way every single one of these things so like the
mels/015628.pt|which means peacock is like i said dead i think they're dead in the water
mels/005613.pt|long one clip i just said everyone choosing
mels/008014.pt|damn if they're not really another game like it there's really not another game like it
mels/016376.pt|this money went to fraud but what i want to talk about is the larger problem
mels/021945.pt|of strategy as doing hard things i have been in a meeting i remember when i was
mels/002807.pt|and you don't really know why
mels/028087.pt|at design he tries to use it
mels/003307.pt|they said while some maintain that two consecutive quarters
mels/031009.pt|you know i'm a gift giver i like to give gifts i give a lot of gifts so i got him i got him that
mels/024975.pt|kept on one it got so many negative posts that it was ranked as one of the most hated brands so
mels/014868.pt|as we start getting a position of power
mels/016709.pt|the infrastructure hopefully you know but the
mels/000369.pt|on my bachelor party i have lost
mels/019516.pt|until it wasn't a foot and then people measured it and sued
mels/011558.pt|rick and morty is one piece for geniuses yes well said
mels/028644.pt|and i grind and i get it
mels/006511.pt|plus it's amazing but it's been proven again and again and
mels/008856.pt|and he's got kids on kids what if they make him buy it at a lesser
mels/010544.pt|i'm already on a team you're goping down
mels/012820.pt|i told the story a couple
mels/007174.pt|work on my stream for a minute after he had a breakout performance at this new york tournament
mels/029028.pt|i remember what started it specifically
mels/013783.pt|at portal and it was actually a good product and nobody used it because they
mels/014524.pt|if likes to quote the great philosophers and he did those riot games as they've always said
mels/012975.pt|and like if you look at a country like norway or something they pay teachers way better it's
mels/002986.pt|so we're looking around everyone's gonna
mels/010894.pt|hello today i am proud to announce that my stream segment is brought to you by my good friends at the minions movie rise of
mels/006694.pt|no hulu you didn't pay for this
mels/029949.pt|well yeah watch watch tomorrow everybody
mels/022736.pt|all because they thought they could compete with the iphone but google said you know let's not get
mels/012929.pt|we do social media well instead of
mels/031613.pt|he's the first white guy to ever win a
mels/012689.pt|or days until your whole life is rotted
mels/013389.pt|oh nice it's first class in economy it's a rare
mels/008018.pt|while the exploring this one i like i i just i think about exploring
mels/018649.pt|so nobody's acquired discord yet discord is the hottest acquisition i would think among anyone trying to build a whole ecosystem in the gaming space
mels/024101.pt|youtube commenter on my channel because i now have a new goat that's right bad boy halo watched my hitman vid that's right i'm in the dream smp now
mels/012572.pt|okay yeah so i finally signed into that
mels/003003.pt|it doesn't look at anybody else she looks at her friend dead
mels/002844.pt|past judicial records what she has
mels/015434.pt|for example red notice was the biggest movie on netflix this year red notice is no
mels/019561.pt|oh my god this is the most divisive one of all i'm actually liking

mels/023046.pt|and they forced them to change
mels/028391.pt|we think you're not thinking globally enough and i find that to be quite
mels/016367.pt|or from the federal government allegedly claiming he had
mels/008152.pt|how's it going how's it going how's it going

mels/010517.pt|i was just saying uh what
mels/021449.pt|one a lot so when you see gamestop stock at
mels/024934.pt|the truth is he tried a skill game does it make as much money people don't like to compete on skill they the truth is he tried a skill-based game it doesn't make as much money people
mels/019763.pt|the general idea in marketing about hype is this okay hype is of course a good thing
mels/023532.pt|that they they get both they get the
mels/016075.pt|it's a long time industry staple and it appears to be a recreational fluid the next personal case study
mels/022865.pt|what does this guy's bets you'd be a billionaire
mels/020662.pt|get to the house kid let's go to our third

mels/018228.pt|but like no one's taking this
mels/006979.pt|with the year it's like hey did you save half because it's
mels/016491.pt|almost everybody kind of averages out to around a middle level
mels/029495.pt|if the four slices of bread no other
mels/010771.pt|if the for parts exactly exactly
mels/010605.pt|i cannot cannot must not curse today i need my i need to be squeaky clean and
mels/011943.pt|it's probably like a total of 150
mels/029954.pt|what in like five minutes i'm not
mels/010009.pt|it is very funny it's not funny actually it's bullying is what it is my editor who was who edited that video was
mels/000887.pt|in the middle uh jake you
mels/027553.pt|then the day it was set to happen the morning it was
mels/016146.pt|just being shirtless in like 20 minutes
mels/017801.pt|part of his brand and it makes you feel proud to support him financially um so it's unique thing about his model
mels/000797.pt|with hundreds and i was like it doesn't look awesome anymore and so i'm like wait can you give me that back and i'll just venmo you because when i get home i want to show ari the fat wallet this is the mistake if

mels/014939.pt|and see if we can make this a little bigger and keith are we ready for that first sponsor question he's telling me
mels/026688.pt|these meetings i didn't know this is this
mels/007375.pt|way tournaments and there's a simple binary
mels/008656.pt|an auditor they've got a lot of things what it could be higher it could be seven percent or whatever but it needs to be like for for
mels/019650.pt|we go back go back go back back
mels/002785.pt|it's really anyway let me get uh
mels/017450.pt|cup partying is playing league of legends but that's what i did and that is the
mels/002574.pt|i have six dollars to my name is that enough for
mels/030812.pt|grinding and i got the i got the high score and this kid probably waiting for his chance or her chance
mels/017537.pt|literally today a company that you may know
mels/005663.pt|well just because like among streamers i think there's like everyone's i
mels/008493.pt|back to back to back to back to back 12
mels/025603.pt|on valley explosion were facebook amazon apple netflix
mels/031262.pt|illegally in the mall of atlanta at
mels/009478.pt|escapes dude he's going to die every time
mels/014158.pt|courage resigns okay they start go over to youtube
mels/015861.pt|it's kind of early days for them
mels/000302.pt|i didn't think i'd see them some of them not at the wedding even and
mels/016580.pt|if he's he's making a mint right now and
mels/032096.pt|in his legs were wide open kind of like they are now he does that all the time i haven't seen anyone spread their
mels/021445.pt|sure to end up losing you money
mels/018323.pt|okay so what a spec does
mels/030342.pt|on the the female flight suits the
mels/019825.pt|i mean really it's it if you consider
mels/017550.pt|in the past decade and a half if you had bought apple stock
mels/017914.pt|the theater experience is generally different it's there's more excitement in the theater there's people yelling
mels/026269.pt|that conclusion if you look at the data it
mels/019392.pt|in this is where jason and a good data person really makes marketing shine jason made this
mels/001086.pt|it won't be invited nor asked to but i'm sure he will
mels/031815.pt|in the world and it's small and
mels/002763.pt|with us about their stuff to talk about i do have some other stuff to talk about i
mels/007050.pt|isn't that odd isn't that odd hey truck why didn't you
mels/025844.pt|switching directors switching talent swapping in and out trying to find the right fit they farted out a bad movie a poorly received movie 10 years later
mels/021585.pt|for cheaper and they went to go buy it back
mels/006068.pt|what the games he wants to get better at the games he's always laid back
mels/026848.pt|of course comes from the hoster himself
mels/014298.pt|gone past the sticks and stones era it's gone past the guns era and we are now in the nuclear bomb era this is the nuclear bombs of the streaming wars and i want to show you this
mels/010277.pt|what a cute cats there's no getting around it there's no getting around what a cute cat there's no getting around it there's no
mels/008048.pt|long paragraphs of text which there's a lot and if you want to see
mels/019865.pt|and it was supposed to be a godlike
mels/015169.pt|for this show it's been viewed over
mels/024071.pt|week is taco bell actually you
mels/016060.pt|in a truck oh god hi
mels/000832.pt|when did that happen and he's like oh yeah so i was a
mels/026453.pt|and then finally he competes and wins
mels/011915.pt|you can see this this is like
mels/000608.pt|things like a story it's like a story of like a
mels/021130.pt|the ancient it's i can't if it was on purpose like if they were like you know what we can
mels/013746.pt|i like to hate on me when i say tesla might not be worth more than every other car company on earth combined they might not have been adding the value of three mcdonald's in the past two months maybe the stocks overvalued maybe the fact that he's constantly finding
mels/014956.pt|own personal accounting which is great i think a lot of people and this is myself included um leave out a lot of things
mels/030020.pt|started this game out muted i'm not gonna lie i'll keep it a
mels/021221.pt|i think they're going to cut their losses as of the end of
mels/022860.pt|we didn't like stocks all the time and then they said do you remember an example and he said yeah i said it about amazon i was one of the
mels/013411.pt|well people are entertained that's a good
mels/012857.pt|it's too unreliable so i swore right then i was
mels/022156.pt|it kicked off a new trend of
mels/009786.pt|let me check is that what 70
mels/013871.pt|the main thing let's do one more fail
mels/017621.pt|i have the margins and the
mels/022757.pt|when anything you could say anything on the internet you'd make a bunch of money mark
mels/027921.pt|the market route weekly sales down 64
mels/011566.pt|or said yes this will be my new aesthetic and music taste now
mels/006031.pt|who was the teammates you remember i
mels/004921.pt|on his promise so they froze hiring people started leaving and
mels/023188.pt|candy if you see made with real fruit assume that this is candy fruit roll-ups is candy when you look at the ingredients it's very obvious that it's mostly just sugar
mels/028222.pt|obviously my ego can easily be
mels/008273.pt|it's like the first wave of games i'm
mels/030724.pt|vladimir putin probably only got the bicycle question
mels/018320.pt|whether you're on the exchange anyone can buy you
mels/019470.pt|it's that she's got a woman's voice and you
mels/025390.pt|you can get a team liquid hoodie for
mels/022617.pt|i am dropping bunker how real does it look hiding thanks ron
mels/021317.pt|another interesting graph in this past year in gaming is that rust and among us both after years of no sales use creators to make millions these
mels/001534.pt|the okay very very and this is this is simple
mels/023971.pt|announced a new app called only fans tv
mels/005122.pt|you could take a bathroom break yeah
mels/018360.pt|what i gotta find someone new i got i
mels/010473.pt|pretty vehemently opposed it because the nature and the dynamics of this sort of twisted
mels/007001.pt|and everyone was really nice and
mels/000695.pt|and they start making all this
mels/001331.pt|yeah it's just a fun little hut that i built out here using only primitive tools
mels/007651.pt|the war for the streaming throne and it's
mels/003312.pt|in a recession okay and there's no reason that they would put out this particular
mels/006200.pt|i'm so tired of it it's just like a whole month you know
mels/026346.pt|apple video from the time of the ipod so it's like
mels/015803.pt|watching a lot of amazon prime stuff in general they have they
mels/018387.pt|i don't make any money because like piracy like
mels/027617.pt|not to attract and retain new talent and make actual changes to the to the program and so we'll see how that undergoes jeff bezos came in with a take if you get jeff bezos out of his slumbering post amazon rocket ship retirement to tweet about it then then you know something's big and
mels/013941.pt|plenty of those the payments you make are far
mels/011691.pt|i literally tell myself that oh
mels/015382.pt|they've had more hits for what they spent now is that enough
mels/003148.pt|large and diversified doesn't rely on
mels/015908.pt|we cheap much like how uber is losing money hand over fist all streaming services are burning money they're spending so much money on content and they're not making it back yet and so
mels/010892.pt|and i'm going to reveal what i will be wearing and doing
mels/028497.pt|like let's let's continue this dialogue
mels/027828.pt|what the sheet that someone posted on twitter and
mels/016434.pt|not saying there's an easy solution i'm
mels/004593.pt|won't mention them but i'll keep eating it and
mels/005180.pt|it was i think it was july
mels/015479.pt|and they have the greatest ip and their
mels/020223.pt|condoms what if someone's in trouble officer officer
mels/020789.pt|in those moments we felt like it was over and then we did what no one thought
mels/022023.pt|they get scared boom it's over shut it

mels/007647.pt|on marketing monday streaming wars in fact i am and in fact i just paid avernell an
mels/007328.pt|well the kids and uh the
mels/011591.pt|my opinion was i kind of wish they didn't use black and white for the last like eight episodes of better call saul not that it was i i loved it i thought
mels/019414.pt|maybe need some work and for that reason i have created something quite special a marketing monday jingle tier list okay wait i
mels/027562.pt|if people got a little concerned because uh
mels/024795.pt|at the quote do not tell them that people don't spend money that is cancer whatever you do if you spend money in a game other players
mels/028039.pt|if you join the union you won't get a raise by the way this is illegal but
mels/015102.pt|about like 50. it was a
mels/001723.pt|he's on like it's like set in the
mels/030977.pt|go off king damn i i immediately i mean i literally the second i saw this i was like
mels/028715.pt|i was trying to impress him and it worked and he was interested he was like hey tell you what well if you're press how about i see
mels/024320.pt|if the country and it's a super bowl ad you're selling these cars across the country if not globally and you spend half the ad like kind of insulting other cities and
mels/031573.pt|for the first time is like wait what flash
mels/003576.pt|if i ignore it it won't it won't exist i like the idea of like
mels/027699.pt|awesome it has all the functionality you
mels/016336.pt|he canonically in north korea invented the hamburger that's awesome we all own a debt and
mels/002459.pt|there's a great book called how brands grow that's all about that it's very
mels/018475.pt|and microsoft watched dude bill gates
mels/012962.pt|at school and come back that's fine
mels/008574.pt|i don't think because i'm clowning on elon for
mels/011777.pt|two problems here not only am i not in the larping but i'm also i know too much about star wars
mels/028782.pt|this question and i knew if they asked me what i currently make i was going to say
mels/023990.pt|the money they are not you have to be so stupid
mels/025605.pt|but with the change of facebook to meta
mels/028728.pt|and while i'm doing this i've also been applying for jobs okay and one thing i was doing to apply for jobs is i went to the riot games linkedin and i joined some resume review contest where you submit your resume and you
mels/003983.pt|the bald no he wasn't bald bros
mels/026051.pt|and unfolds over the next decades the pipeline is there and ready but kids are gonna need tech education because alexa this is real this is actually i thought
mels/009941.pt|know it sounds crazy people don't think the long game there's plenty of people that have it's like
mels/020065.pt|actually the biggest ones are companies that are
mels/014673.pt|no wins and fails i'm gonna
mels/005073.pt|ideally ideally we get some sort of consequences for this guy um that you
mels/029274.pt|for a western team's korean player
mels/026593.pt|okay get a pr person stay out of the
mels/030351.pt|this year because of having been forced to really spend a lot of time together because of code but i just
mels/005077.pt|bridge on that now thankfully though thankfully though because
mels/004711.pt|i walked in on ari listening to the full album today and she was jamming to dancing in the balloon light so end of the day that's a queen uh i'm putting on right now it'll just
mels/017226.pt|if there were in poor judgment and
mels/024321.pt|it says a weird line it
mels/030505.pt|i swear to god i'm almost about to
mels/021719.pt|if i was picking a spokeswoman i wouldn't go to amy schumer i feel like you could get somebody from and you would get less hate on social media than if you got amy schumer
mels/004257.pt|make it even more hyped up and more insane they always they add lies to it and then it
mels/017093.pt|this is what like someone who just found out it's like what tommy
mels/002644.pt|it's guaranteed money this is guaranteed money this
mels/027853.pt|there is some entertainment value in that he was running luna which is what's called a stable coin with the idea being that it's tied to the us dollar and thus is much more stable but unfortunately all
mels/004809.pt|the for anything because if the contract is is
mels/026360.pt|the genius bar again the gtsbar
mels/016715.pt|we don't have that in america so hopefully we'll find a different solution like
mels/025629.pt|what are you microsoft if you remember last week on marketing monday i announced that sony had a record
mels/021253.pt|he had a video where he put a
mels/001803.pt|the the best remember but it's fine
mels/031584.pt|loses puts his head on his keyboard and cries
mels/009303.pt|the state of michigan is running
mels/011066.pt|cause he's not posted let me ask
mels/018670.pt|microsoft did was they came out with a very attractive price point for the
mels/010217.pt|if your week look like oh well actually i'm i'm watching top
mels/014777.pt|that you can use to um easily categorize your expenses
mels/003014.pt|if you're looking at like we're
mels/019067.pt|a lot of this generally creeps me out generally when i see you know the picture of a digital
mels/000566.pt|big stack of money we have go down
mels/029464.pt|while the internship though he's like well what
mels/022898.pt|it does anything on it and they don't allow you to do any other payment
mels/013035.pt|you know what yeah let's run it
mels/025299.pt|yeah i'm done but you do do that for prime video for disney plus for apple tv for who you know that's that's more common of a behavior people are much more
mels/023358.pt|a great competition customers win so it's
mels/014530.pt|i said something that's really wise one of the wisest things he's ever
mels/020653.pt|of reasons it cannot go to the real winner cutie cinderella cutie cinderella did win this award
mels/025756.pt|it's public awareness ads always feel like they can go to extreme shock value because they have no corporation
mels/020158.pt|and the information highway but they feel more alone and
mels/020848.pt|well he dropped what i think is the single greatest advice thread on twitter you can decide we're
mels/030273.pt|if the dog was like a background element of a meadow it was a
mels/021924.pt|i had to take a loss on editing
mels/027852.pt|as company is down this guy's coin is down
mels/024631.pt|which means yet again i was right
mels/024710.pt|federal officials trading stocks and we should have more accountability and they should have to sell their stocks it's very interesting that that
mels/000451.pt|apple and vodka all night but i get very hungers and so at
mels/022531.pt|google like supplied the funds to make this movie happen
mels/009314.pt|it'd be interesting but how about just not gamble easy peasy yeah it's easy for some people i'd say most people if they're starting to have a financially ruinous situation over gambling can stop but some people have a very difficult time
mels/000008.pt|to to start with i do remember so we were all walking it was like
mels/009858.pt|it's like one of the reasons americans romanticized college so much it was because the only time in their lives they get to live like near friends in a nice walkable neighborhood
mels/004433.pt|will say keep it up keep it up king it's the best no
mels/000011.pt|and of all six of us he looks only at me he
mels/027192.pt|and he was assigned to the game
mels/022968.pt|it's multiple years if ever and because of the documents that was leaked we actually found out
mels/017459.pt|i really really was impressed by it and the
mels/003699.pt|it like an example i would give is like you know people think oh my god a company
mels/025788.pt|is himself said this i think at this point it's safe to say activision blizzard is the most evil video game company ever this is a picture of the ceo of
mels/007603.pt|so i could tell hilarious stories about them but
mels/015195.pt|they don't have to make everything in la
mels/018808.pt|with the creative one this is a five when it came out it's very pretentious this is
mels/028537.pt|please help me tax ninja you're my only hope
mels/020134.pt|the theory i have about canadian marketing
mels/027897.pt|i think bubble i'm sorry that i'm i'm
mels/001645.pt|we ignore them and it just adds
mels/006722.pt|get off get a job dude
mels/023209.pt|in some apple juice and a lot of like grape juice white grape juice but it's
mels/003648.pt|if you kind of reset the scale and don't have generational inherited
mels/028125.pt|he called like yeah b riley principal 150
mels/030809.pt|with a group of friends on one of my first
mels/010436.pt|it's to meal you know mac and cheese
mels/017077.pt|it's an event it happened we should remark on it we shouldn't get all upset about
mels/029224.pt|and port job i'm like yes there are and important job i'm like yes dude an important job an
mels/009760.pt|it's fun i'll tell you that
mels/016313.pt|with the other corporate warehouses to number of injuries per employee and that is awesome you can't be these are
mels/020163.pt|it's true that the this could only have
mels/016264.pt|i realize is anthony davis and russell westbrook have not been used on a losing graphic yet and i know the next question what about the winning graphics i'm
mels/025560.pt|the were immediately quitting because they found out how
mels/020683.pt|i honestly hadn't even heard of this game before
mels/026461.pt|intelligent for the modern times you know you could
mels/008584.pt|that from you and you say no you say no you can't buy it from me i want to keep it which is what happened by the way twitter fought tooth and nail for him to not buy them then you go
mels/031379.pt|listen when i think boat when i think it's six people all from
mels/030703.pt|i knew was the largest like in the world and i knew what had three hundred rivers flowing into and only one river flowing out of it that's i knew was the largest lake in the world and i knew it had 300 rivers flowing into it
mels/003409.pt|and tensions between the united states and china over taiwan are heating up dramatically in fact nancy pelosi who has a planned trip to taiwan is basically right now in a
mels/008930.pt|in the court process to enforce it all constitute an elaborate joke
mels/031579.pt|the behind the ridges is now on
mels/019729.pt|is stupid that's number one number two is gating all of the jobs they want to
mels/032314.pt|my goal and was such a hype moment
mels/025761.pt|whoa big twist good oh my god good
mels/029030.pt|like arguing about it and we had been with the group we'd been with the girl
mels/015179.pt|what netflix to be included at
mels/013479.pt|so maybe get on your grind even earlier maybe this is kind of old in fact if you're if you're only rich by the time you're this age i feel like you're late
mels/007572.pt|in a stupid australian voice he won't
mels/001796.pt|let's see it i don't really know
mels/019044.pt|you probably aren't going to meet
mels/010013.pt|and then obviously i switched it but it was bullying okay and i want that to be well understood
mels/016713.pt|yeah i mean some countries have handled
mels/024777.pt|so the next thing they'll do is battle passes battle passes or any kind of format that requires
mels/025185.pt|his campaign to get some onion rings to pair nicely with your new logo let me know who i should help next okay so that you know it's a maybe it's not my cup of humor but
mels/019401.pt|we got such a high score that we unlocked a castle in the alps and the
mels/025537.pt|good console with a bad one and so
mels/022324.pt|i the interview about this he doesn't know what twitter facebook tumblr is
mels/000790.pt|there's no reason i can't pay even though it's my bachelor party i wanted to pay for the boys and so there was a dinner where we all went out and everyone
mels/032137.pt|ready to go they were like oh it's
mels/006265.pt|i know she just doesn't like me to show the food even though i think it's very delicious
mels/003209.pt|what it's called uh dramatically diminished
mels/015530.pt|that makes them a ton of money and so
mels/003514.pt|i i can't pretend like this is like a great period but
mels/001451.pt|one more this one's only for factor though okay let's see
mels/013862.pt|because they like it okay and every sony fan in the comments is like
mels/013529.pt|mash back then like at all competitively but
mels/018763.pt|where android is cheaper and has more market share but
mels/013129.pt|through connery's pants but i had
mels/024709.pt|this article went up saying that
mels/000763.pt|i had a genius video idea so when you're walking around vegas there's a lot of like moving billboards and uh and
mels/000338.pt|it wouldn't do anything like the
mels/008207.pt|say on that or do on that um
mels/007008.pt|i was like first of all i don't drink coffee i don't drink coffee that's not i don't drink
mels/002044.pt|both no you can't be both obviously
mels/003205.pt|for the reporting and they fail for what actually happened about the game actually infinity i dunno if you guys have heard of this game it's basically a for the reporting and a fail for what actually happened about the game axi infinity i
mels/004326.pt|the show i will give you
mels/025443.pt|it's ad was terrible but i liked it more than the pepsi one because they mentioned gamers and i'm a gamer so i feel heard and
mels/027464.pt|if the pr in the wild there was
mels/011716.pt|i'm not gonna be able to find it
mels/032178.pt|the day became saturday and saturday was exactly the casinos still talk about
mels/007115.pt|it has been delivering me game of thrones
mels/021281.pt|so prime is amazing no one can no one
mels/028471.pt|all these reports what were you doing yeah you
mels/022727.pt|light the world on fire just so we don't forget microsoft acquired all these buildings
mels/023860.pt|one of the biggest boons of all time but this time around marketers are smarter and they've learned
mels/014757.pt|what the commenting on the video viewers this
mels/023956.pt|but maybe the baking soda like things that are more generic
mels/005867.pt|if the first time usually a nice funny
mels/031142.pt|someone i know as a friend i like ludwig
mels/023167.pt|shoe polish yeah they'll just basically paint shoe polish onto the line the grill marks to make them pop so basically when you see a food a
mels/007516.pt|ask him right now wait where's my phone let
mels/011565.pt|is entirely based on that movie
mels/024478.pt|we ad space to make an ad that's more forgettable and expensive with
mels/018978.pt|the free and it's just as funny it's in fact more funny because 60 year
mels/028615.pt|by the second year i was no longer ranked i hadn't played any solo queue and i'd gotten pretty rusty and somebody made a bet with me that i couldn't get diamond again because they added ranks like you couldn't get diamond you're trash now
mels/002949.pt|it was nobody talks in that movie
mels/015475.pt|the extra money now if they were able to do it where it was like hey you get it all if you just pay the normal
mels/016885.pt|it's like every crater on twitch did not get better when the pandemic happened but they got richer you know what i'm saying because
mels/008736.pt|if he can prove that then they've got
mels/032243.pt|the asian man this guy shows up at the table with
mels/003330.pt|but in history where there is a bit of labor activity
mels/008898.pt|the day twitter is other rich dudes you
mels/002334.pt|wait here on twitch what's the meta now
mels/027028.pt|we out of ideas it was
mels/018859.pt|many reasons but the fact that he had to go to a vocal booth and say
mels/009369.pt|from the lcs i'm the analyst now uh taking
mels/029507.pt|i could have been a lot of people i was saying you know some of my
mels/020092.pt|you do not end up getting along and they forced steve out of apple in
mels/016585.pt|what they do is now uh
mels/022517.pt|time on i literally think if they just fired their entire marketing team and just showed 30 seconds unbroken of a whopper looking
mels/019350.pt|for as long as i can remember dude this
mels/025235.pt|and video games outside of three hours a week one hour on friday
mels/030874.pt|are you high this time you
mels/030523.pt|if you're this is a societal norm that i don't think anyone has to adhere to but the idea is you're supposed to ask her father's permission my plan was
mels/027618.pt|in the question he says basically about this tweet talking about how tesla has a second bigot market in china chinese
mels/006442.pt|i can't believe he just verbatim described
mels/004800.pt|billion dollars no regardless but the language
mels/026557.pt|in the paid mechanics which is shocking given its popularity again this guy could probably sell
mels/009142.pt|absolute dill weed and making an absolute
mels/025521.pt|if you recall in my video back in january i predicted that
mels/019384.pt|so we had to make this slide because it was demanded by the actual teacher of the class this was actually i remember talking to teacher and he was like you you have to you you have to credit some other people
mels/022881.pt|i channel i hope i hope to see some of you in chat i hope
mels/022214.pt|yeah i mean in general a heartwarming ad
mels/010921.pt|it's a little more of like uh
mels/022422.pt|it's good but it was the most blatant and i saw it when i was young and it just sort of
mels/028694.pt|if the the costco in colorado and i thought about
mels/002860.pt|to my video so let me let you know it's leaning towards you know people are estimating what could happen is that
mels/027161.pt|in dollars the payments on this debt are now one of the biggest parts of the yearly government budget and one of the best ways to make this debt not a problem is to inflate the currency so much that it's not worth as much so if you inflate
mels/003334.pt|labour market is so tight we are actually have some leveraging power as workers at different companies and people are finally beginning to use that now we have to
mels/009795.pt|when you know what i'm saying
mels/015915.pt|let's get away with uh looking if you
mels/016088.pt|there's my case study on spoons what
mels/003952.pt|you know and i think they can cross the aisle
mels/023380.pt|i don't care where it is where i find it i like logic puzzles
mels/027072.pt|it's dancing i thought he would die you thought he would die
mels/023150.pt|this is my social earlier where i said sun's out buns out and obviously like i
mels/013125.pt|do you think game pass will ever go on
mels/027574.pt|there's conceding another part of it is that in the past week as elon musk has been talking about whether or not going to take over twitter there's conceding another part of it is this in the past week as elon musk has been
mels/015681.pt|wanted they're trying to get bigger everyone's
mels/013981.pt|it seems like a smart guy but basically he said things like we're in the we are past like the era of debt okay we are in the
mels/015269.pt|amazon originals let's get into it prime
mels/009935.pt|there are people defending jake novak in your comment section
mels/018658.pt|and before that i did content marketing management for twitch i was a marketer twitch and i'm a marketer
mels/029152.pt|for four hours but i was a kid you know what i'm like
mels/003640.pt|out of the hands of boomers into their no it's
mels/006690.pt|it's like trying to sell a posture corrector he doesn't need it
mels/019345.pt|was going for all of them enron 2 wanted everything this is where
mels/018260.pt|your brand story into it too let's find out
mels/015818.pt|yeah that's that's almost a guarantee i think that's a big growth area
mels/022182.pt|what an insane commercial a little bit a little bit twisted but remarkably
mels/025616.pt|so if you guys don't know
mels/018520.pt|things like that that's where netflix
mels/007971.pt|we package which means which means two things number one i
mels/001777.pt|i know that they're the same height
mels/007169.pt|no no that is not where i am that's not where i'm going with this okay that's not the that's not the stance
mels/008642.pt|it it's one of the few advantages america has actually
mels/012320.pt|like for the kids that didn't want to
mels/017765.pt|you know he doesn't chill for primes
mels/026966.pt|when people over on the concept of the metaverse right now right now because again they're about
mels/015685.pt|emerge last a few more years and then die that is my
mels/024758.pt|if that were stopping people before from getting
mels/015482.pt|costs more than a month of disney plus so if they put everything on disney plus instead of you buying all
mels/014262.pt|i'm sorry i just had to call this out
mels/032054.pt|the reports that is so much worse this was before
mels/031309.pt|i want to break this 20 for this water
mels/003528.pt|and you have to be careful with you know
mels/021181.pt|what millennials actually look like this is the share of wealth in uh in the
mels/008080.pt|during black history month would be
mels/004877.pt|actually splits his time amongst a bunch
mels/000945.pt|it was a surprise to me thank god that it got leaked because i had a bunch of not a bunch but
mels/028259.pt|i know that person and i go call that person oh my god oh my god you should not have told me you should not have told me this phone call with this person it's like i discovered a serial killer this person was a girl
mels/013265.pt|it goes back to one man one devious
mels/006953.pt|and i was one of the youngest but there i go now
mels/006156.pt|back-to-back crowns no big deal one of them golds through and through yeah three monitors yeah
mels/021755.pt|let me just go back and just break down
mels/014499.pt|i don't need a bagel that bad
mels/012985.pt|as level of a bunch of different subjects is like the wackest way to do school
mels/022981.pt|the butter knife to a gunfight shocking dozens these are all internal
mels/023092.pt|as i wanna talk about people taste tested these two wines okay
mels/022280.pt|but it might be really sad so don't watch it
mels/025598.pt|you need to smile more hey this is
mels/027787.pt|it out of control once that starts to get crazy the government has only one
mels/031542.pt|it's happening no the other guy does not know
mels/031143.pt|something and he had done a subathon and
mels/008398.pt|in the nation that has handled some of the biggest business dealings of all time has to read about
mels/009902.pt|you have to do is go complain at the
mels/028433.pt|hair so yeah i was badass
mels/029797.pt|what everyone still had that respect and
mels/016508.pt|the seconds and do a bunch of them
mels/019430.pt|the name and the call to action
mels/020903.pt|start to make money extremely slow and also
mels/015883.pt|which has all the pirated content from disney and netflix okay but it makes it more money it
mels/029607.pt|i can't even that's crazy because
mels/010432.pt|what are they going to want the wedding
mels/030796.pt|it's era eminem bar i don't even know the song but i can
mels/014242.pt|at platform youtube is smoother than twitch
mels/010579.pt|i want to go out i let him out he
mels/016240.pt|got wins and fails wins and
mels/003160.pt|ad network on their own users which they
mels/015131.pt|he's the most powerful talent agent in the world right now he's the guy that ari gold from entourage was based off of his
mels/031208.pt|oh here it is the secret behind
mels/009233.pt|but i remember i kicked it really hard once trying to do that and i didn't move my other leg in time so it just flipped
mels/030069.pt|i need anything that's that's it and i was like i know my birthday's coming up in april i don't want a gift
mels/028752.pt|in california had to move back home to colorado and when i moved home to colorado i get
mels/021403.pt|this is going to go down that if we start to make it go up even a
mels/026350.pt|and it's noticeable right it is a noticeable difference now microsoft in
mels/015341.pt|was keep prime churn down and they'll spend almost any amount of money to do it but
mels/022414.pt|it's because it's already over he
mels/002103.pt|but i draft so it's fun
mels/016416.pt|in more the people that get that money first get to buy everything before inflation takes hold that's what
mels/028926.pt|well let me share my story without feeling
mels/031701.pt|wait there's no shot at works because he'll
mels/009862.pt|i think i have a unique experience
mels/006027.pt|yeah you can leave dude you're actually you're
mels/024943.pt|good absolutely not the cool thing about the pendulum is that as the market shifts towards one way the few people remaining on the other
mels/022788.pt|that's terrible but if you buy a company that
mels/024237.pt|and then yes that was probably actually
mels/015197.pt|over the world and then exporting great shows
mels/012592.pt|we've got a broad base of incomes and good ip so they're probably set pretty well for
mels/001492.pt|what the problem with this setup well it's my game show so
mels/028707.pt|he's like hey because i i was trying to
mels/025910.pt|a blizzard event and said freedom for hong kong the glorious revolution of our age something like that
mels/022116.pt|can i please offer you a hug we're
mels/008792.pt|in payment from elon to twitter
mels/031182.pt|or something that there was a lot of doubt like oh
mels/024962.pt|most hated brand in every country
mels/000681.pt|and and she just she heard about this
mels/029823.pt|are definitely told me about it at some point but i
mels/006868.pt|to twitch and that was my twitch halloween costume which is
mels/016449.pt|no more that benefits us as prices rise simply we'll have less money to spend it
mels/028236.pt|even though he's way different than i thought he was he's actually way more funny and
mels/003468.pt|and i will think about it more for next week i only got the feedback that we need to be a little more positive this week and it was too late so i
mels/006770.pt|one part actually of yesterday it was the only fun part
mels/021312.pt|that got on a premier night okay mtv has about
mels/013921.pt|i now pay later and apparently this type of payment system is extremely popular
mels/017908.pt|go back to the go back to the clock model
mels/016489.pt|we are massive title wave coming and decided to
mels/016171.pt|it's like it just feels like a better way to get exercise you know
mels/020384.pt|they're making fun of nostalgia and commercials and they do it and then they
mels/003535.pt|is it not smart to buy a house right now it just depends on what deals some
mels/026821.pt|way content lives so it's it's all bad over it over at facebook and that's why they dropped i think i think it's the largest i think it is a historic drop facebook
mels/005444.pt|you're so lucky dude this guy probably
mels/009826.pt|i mean it's positive trend we want to get more because right now if you look at the top car sales in america the top six are like gigantic trucks
mels/025958.pt|they'll bounce back when they get when they get more
mels/004690.pt|yeah and that'll really bring it together
mels/015037.pt|too young to even have this netflix and it wasn't even that long ago this was what netflix was in the early
mels/001419.pt|not google it can i get a scout
mels/028200.pt|the tournament twitch steps in and pays for buses and a new uh venue and
mels/015877.pt|you to take marketing money to the big screen well it's not really the big screen is
mels/007594.pt|service for genesis which is fine
mels/030404.pt|and so he's like as he's
mels/002748.pt|a genius mind paid you a mere 150
mels/001694.pt|i don't remember grandpa joe being a perv i just remember him laying in bed while the mom his daughter works like a slave like she's working non-stop like three jobs to provide for everybody in this house and then the second
mels/030917.pt|well listen i think you're great all
mels/004992.pt|extremely bad for elon um those loans
mels/029341.pt|i try to like put the jacket off but underneath the jacket i have like a
mels/008721.pt|what there's a legal term for it it's like
mels/000875.pt|jake four four five six you
mels/012264.pt|or area with like a legitimate sabacc
mels/007652.pt|yeah with a netflix logo for a face on a giant throne of like
mels/022217.pt|so if they're gonna make you care about something enough to cry when it dies they have
mels/023913.pt|when i was a kid i was always like i
mels/012567.pt|at the sponsorship and so my public account is
mels/011617.pt|so i thought all i have is basically the weekend i have like friday
mels/026419.pt|it requires money to buy and so i've done a
mels/013542.pt|but like 17 different people probably that
mels/010587.pt|in chats and they did this and then i asked the question everyone in chat said they did this and then i asked
mels/002508.pt|want to skip marketing monday and be our fourth and fall guys not really but i'm also only doing
mels/029909.pt|teen years old and lonely and all his friend group is melee and they're they're they pretty much hate
mels/011436.pt|so yeah it should be fun should be it should be a good ass week
mels/028448.pt|is important this is the gun in screenwriting
mels/003792.pt|i'm sorry just talking like talking
mels/020768.pt|each one means a lot to me i definitely don't do it for the money i do it because i love the brands love
mels/021962.pt|nick was in here earlier wanted to get
mels/030040.pt|was yeah that's me that's me what's
mels/028836.pt|at night that's it that's what i did i went to the target near the near the
mels/009562.pt|if the cameras there oh my
mels/014200.pt|ignore those basically pretend this this thing is
mels/009620.pt|with this entire game he has been pulling
mels/015264.pt|they they don't make a ton of money yet and so they can only raise prices if they keep great quality low churn so it depends
mels/006660.pt|the low point i was so miserable i

mels/017469.pt|put up to try and um
mels/024900.pt|into to use to make smart choices but we hate using it and one of the ways to ensure we always use system 1 is to put us

mels/003299.pt|i get kind of serious for
mels/029510.pt|is there anything you felt got slighted
mels/029166.pt|to either a water fire or electric type depending on what stone it's given
mels/030077.pt|if the kid that delays a marshmallow to get two
mels/031465.pt|continues to grow maybe i could try something like this in
mels/011606.pt|to agree i don't like everyone
mels/022066.pt|this has happened to me at twitch so i
mels/000496.pt|because in my mind germa has
mels/014074.pt|the that amazon execs calling me like what
mels/010692.pt|that's i don't i don't like actively not care it's not like
mels/017997.pt|in the country but they have you know like supreme court
mels/011624.pt|after she watched it now she's like a
mels/000290.pt|but we're not putting 50 racks each
mels/024688.pt|and they ah they have to walk away
mels/022941.pt|the war but your license to use unreal engine 4
mels/026050.pt|so long term the company is already working with preschools to establish the foundation of tech education so that as our hiring demand
mels/025814.pt|is on top of the world today let's start by talking about arcane again okay
mels/011994.pt|who are also first order and i'm starting to realize that
mels/009375.pt|the way you play these is you find the absolute shittiest player on their team you triple band them
mels/010440.pt|please ignore my sub love the content what a strange message nine month viewer nine month chatter i figured that
mels/015019.pt|but the netflix that you're thinking of not this
mels/011239.pt|yeah i've been pumping them out i've never really seen that
mels/016476.pt|it's early days before he founded amazon and
mels/011258.pt|we have anything planned we did nothing we just sat there
mels/015289.pt|if the more they've purchased almost everything that's available cheaply they've bought it all okay
mels/020172.pt|it just stop relating stop stop
mels/031618.pt|americans would call other americans foreigners because if you're not
mels/024449.pt|pretty regularly and most of them are so bad they're not even worth like
mels/001841.pt|new map stream i did it yesterday i got a world record three times in one day on the new map but
mels/005631.pt|it literally the first thing he says to me was some like
mels/015433.pt|what else can compete with that
mels/010647.pt|gonna stop and i won't be cursing
mels/000412.pt|if the closest thing to a coin flip in
mels/000554.pt|is very baller so so at this point we're all up money by the way literally
mels/006532.pt|they wouldn't do this if they couldn't make money they're not in the business of just giving you
mels/015145.pt|they've issued junk bonds to get
mels/023192.pt|ten months of a cow's life
mels/022168.pt|and i was like damn that is you really took it to that next level huh that's emotionally manipulative and they played that ad everywhere it probably
mels/000424.pt|in the thing is it didn't matter that they were making fun of me it didn't matter that i was being laughed at it didn't matter that i was annoying them because i was winning every single one
mels/021920.pt|at posts and then i get more funny twitch
mels/000232.pt|wins everyone wins you all make money
mels/023250.pt|but it's basically about how our
mels/022562.pt|if you might be in danger of breaking your
mels/027446.pt|in meetings with her team and like bouncing ideas and then paying and then she writes the
mels/004951.pt|nobody else wants to pick him up now
mels/024672.pt|know exactly how this is gonna
mels/021776.pt|is that they hate each other and there's like a real anger brewing a real tension it celebs
mels/030565.pt|what that doesn't look like me you think i got
mels/019143.pt|or in person the top comment the tough comment at
mels/017369.pt|the amazon fail let's give a win to
mels/015939.pt|it's like it's not relevant to the other companies just just netflix
mels/020517.pt|well and a lot of them don't they have no risk appetite they can't think of cool ideas they don't know what their fans want to hear
mels/027023.pt|and i said well i've seen a horse and a dog so far so it's definitely budweiser they have a type they have a type and it's very distinct
mels/000935.pt|or three are me me me right now you have been here for two months and you've only showed up when
mels/018781.pt|i say the globe and so the real takeaway chat if
mels/026210.pt|a more in-depth one and this one i really think my audience today are you aware in my chat of an app called klarna who here knows about klarna okay well there's a there's a karma there's a
mels/009735.pt|it won't like it'll just damage my nails but without
mels/001706.pt|well i'll be interested to hear more
mels/004045.pt|and i just did not catch up and i woke
mels/028624.pt|i played mid so i immediately queue up
mels/020267.pt|during couldn't get the chance let's start with a pepsi commercial because i always hate pepsi commercials santa my man making a pepsi but mr
mels/026734.pt|like they're gonna have to give a huge cut to
mels/016278.pt|a big warm shout out to our favorite promisers in the gaming
mels/021956.pt|wait a minute but if we do it who can copy us you need
mels/028488.pt|and this kid never knew this kid never knew i was there and he turns around and
mels/004704.pt|he's trying his best to be relatable
mels/003282.pt|okay this one's about protests all over ecuador because of a spike in prices for food and fuel that sounds depressing i'm
mels/001197.pt|one quick yeah but they're not as healthy that's the thing
mels/021110.pt|we're going to review it and i want you guys honest
mels/024669.pt|why you may have noticed today that everything was down crypto was down stocks were down real estate was down everything was down lost three billion
mels/002332.pt|in me so i can remember to follow you and to thank you i didn't write
mels/024527.pt|was literally spent talking about what the definition of a video game is which
mels/029766.pt|his brother and he just kind of hung out and i remember okay let me tell this
mels/010012.pt|description and it was like this guy is literally pay the musician
mels/018180.pt|it to even it out literally that's not a joke for every 18 to
mels/023310.pt|in the world but it's impressive to see because this could have been a bigger story for longer and it
mels/008068.pt|i wouldn't necessarily say we are basically brothers
mels/023297.pt|that being said this is a complete non-starter this story is dead
mels/018105.pt|we did pepsi man in his own game
mels/027846.pt|i wonder how many of these companies you think are entering the space just
mels/016343.pt|what are the glasses the slick back air
mels/002618.pt|i've never seen such a giga chat response on when
mels/026606.pt|to watch the show the way he delivered this ad read made me feel like i was there watching
mels/030717.pt|that's about all we learned that year
mels/020021.pt|i realize it was a youth medium and not a regular medium i will have to slim down a bit i'll have to stop eating so many
mels/024001.pt|seeing stars this is their chance to break the monopoly the other cold take
mels/006023.pt|for like nothing can stop him he could be
mels/031310.pt|water bottle so i'm just gonna put it back i'm not thinking about
mels/020525.pt|and i i like this a lot so they're doing refunds
mels/023044.pt|and they sued and they lost that lawsuit eventually uh the the
mels/001229.pt|and it's a hard nut to crack for advertisers and marketers and and if you understand it and can make something good on it
mels/021605.pt|he has a hall of fame career that's insane i don't whatever
mels/014882.pt|it's better for players or creators they're
mels/026480.pt|the crypto money to buy this book uh
mels/018931.pt|you're the perfect person to be creating a 10 minute
mels/001619.pt|well and chicken nuggets and then you add one factor meal that's not
mels/004861.pt|if you have going about layoffs basically he
mels/024675.pt|these companies similar to what america did in
mels/006808.pt|play history to be a top player to be like a top top player never
mels/018493.pt|twitch was a pretty big acquisition that was acquired by amazon for one billion dollars a little under actually one billion dollars mojang was acquired this is minecraft which was the biggest game in the world at the time it was acquired and also and also attracts
mels/004633.pt|we manage your wealth and uh
mels/013993.pt|are psychologically susceptible they are more likely to buy things that they cannot afford so

mels/009230.pt|you know you could you could kind of
mels/015489.pt|if they were fully committed they'd be almost unstoppable because they have the best ip in the world but they're not
mels/018696.pt|it all they could just own like if sony just

mels/001914.pt|the privilege of being my editor so i get
mels/025725.pt|we'll get shared a lot on the internet because it's interesting we're going to only attach our brand

mels/020522.pt|the companies in the world is the brand this is a great quote that
mels/002944.pt|ryan gosling talked about his past where
mels/025742.pt|the very good commercials manage to do the
mels/026671.pt|with the is very vividly and this was the first time
mels/025569.pt|it can go without sleeping without stopping and there is no ban on killer robots so we're we're in a interesting time
mels/020684.pt|is year they spent almost nothing on marketing i guess because i had not heard of it a tiny company based in poland named cd something literally no i never
mels/026982.pt|i know crypto boo i know crypto bad i
mels/027480.pt|i thought was impossible every single person on twitter has posted every single variant of every possible take
mels/017357.pt|and unfolds over the next decades the pipeline is there and ready
mels/028151.pt|billion dollars in cash reserves they were gonna
mels/011222.pt|at jfk vaping yeah jfk jewel

mels/015905.pt|it'd be better what i'm here to say is that um
mels/021520.pt|it's doing is people are seeing at home getting traction the government cake and his fair share it's doing is people are sitting at home getting the checks from the government
mels/005158.pt|pretty small fingers right so it's not a lot
mels/009185.pt|if the five gifted how did the paper mario
mels/024706.pt|well points will be magnifique i don't know if you guys

mels/015569.pt|you can just put in the stream stick of
mels/020494.pt|i remember if you guys know
mels/018346.pt|but you get a bigger title quickly
mels/011225.pt|at the standard you know what i'm saying that's
mels/004880.pt|in children with the executives there so i'm not sure that this truly applies there's no way
mels/001414.pt|would love to hear you left
mels/028098.pt|it's actually so crazy how on edge every investor there is at any government action it's the amount of control they have over the market is is insane and as an alibaba investor wow

mels/021910.pt|how like the hardest part of
mels/025651.pt|anyone who invested in squid coin the
mels/007429.pt|getting to where that yeah it's one thing like
mels/020232.pt|at turkey for winning stay tuned for

mels/023177.pt|is what it looks like when i make cereal
mels/028898.pt|and i'm i i've lost control
mels/004714.pt|so royal socks did this and quack help
mels/018137.pt|this is what kendall tried to create
mels/007925.pt|i i don't recall you wouldn't rent a tux right for
mels/000829.pt|i was trying to get to the bottom of this and i couldn't at dinner i kept asking germa okay so
mels/008829.pt|with the past eight nine months
mels/021001.pt|it hits the their theme and is humorous so it's good i i like where you has put the smiley face with watch it is camp grocery album of the years the it it hits their theme and is humorous so it's good i i like where you guys put it it's a smiley face
mels/014887.pt|that a really great launch of halo infinite they had a really great launch of halo
mels/012050.pt|power with the force but it's
mels/020194.pt|if the idea let us improve brand perception with twitter this is why twitter can't make any money
mels/016312.pt|mom and pop shop but they're beating even
mels/012352.pt|that's when i was i was gonna try
mels/031557.pt|but he clears it a super entrenched
mels/022350.pt|watch soap now when they approach
mels/009791.pt|we are giving quotas on when residents can use hot water this is all because
mels/024266.pt|i feel like they had this whole set set up to do a matrix parody the red spoon red dress the agents and the thing
mels/016626.pt|yes it's 19 of the hottest years on
mels/026268.pt|but in fact the data does not bear that
mels/013023.pt|yeah there's a bunch of classes about
mels/032220.pt|now we're even on the weekend whatever we can't get
mels/005217.pt|and had people calling my work trying to get me fired around the
mels/011172.pt|it oh it's it's awesome but
mels/006740.pt|grade school filling in the the full cap
mels/012842.pt|he thinks i made the entire
mels/020844.pt|as and hopefully we can talk through it in a funny and interesting kind of way that's all we're asking hopefully we'll go out a little bit more intelligent a little more thoughtful than we came in
mels/024927.pt|progressing in in games in general you can have a skill game based game you can
mels/027221.pt|what of stuff on this map but you don't see it on their map and in comparison i pulled
mels/000642.pt|to always come back to all they hate when you come back and
mels/023488.pt|their strategy is one of the original the easiest most basic but core marketing strategies and the idea of more for less the idea is literally to show you how much you're getting at an affordable price that is entirely different from
mels/024084.pt|it looks pretty self-explanatory i don't
mels/027107.pt|well i think the safe assumption
mels/006384.pt|congrats for them now it is a little odd that blizzard has pivoted so hard into a
mels/018399.pt|other streamers are probably getting bounties
mels/008296.pt|people when they study listen to like classical music
mels/008737.pt|doesn't seem likely that he has anything at all to go off of
mels/030873.pt|i'm excited are you excited i need
mels/003797.pt|do the right thing because they're not
mels/002478.pt|by even more chips and it was like they just
mels/022796.pt|luke can't pay them back which means that it's just a bunch of outstanding debt and within a few months i believe bank of america had to pay 50 billion
mels/012914.pt|we're going to sell real products like like if the marketing goes well like more
mels/014397.pt|needs to be cracked by youtube it's the
mels/024983.pt|that society is amazon only hated in one country that's germany that's actually
mels/001594.pt|i have no more questions and this bullying of children has been brought to you by the fine folks at factory meals
mels/017940.pt|of ways to get you more involved as a fan after you purchase something but it's it's uh it's a unique situation i
mels/016669.pt|never before this is exponentially decreasing in
mels/017264.pt|let's get back to the wins though uh we
mels/031217.pt|but i also knew that the teachers and the adults that ran
mels/020246.pt|in my room let's talk about the three things
mels/023276.pt|or whatever and i was like i was like
mels/007488.pt|while original joe the original joe burger and
mels/015261.pt|in their market share their global
mels/016865.pt|it's of increases and this is just scaling up
mels/020597.pt|they're having a very heated conversation i don't know what about probably marketing wait i'm
mels/010014.pt|pays a mod now so better watch out watch your steps have you seen his song about school
mels/012794.pt|he'd always say we got this late you know it was annoying but he would do it
mels/018404.pt|well that's the aaa title you showed that one i'm sure
mels/003508.pt|like that so if it's money you can't afford to lose investing now you could see
mels/029109.pt|two weeks before my start date they were like hey we're having a marketing like off site in tahoe
mels/008272.pt|with the clip it that's never happened in gaming before
mels/027771.pt|said Twitter's board has no choice but
mels/020529.pt|this game buggy like ea would cyberpunk will be will be fixed i
mels/016746.pt|as solution for this part of environment and i think uh people that are investing
mels/001855.pt|yeah but it's always like dude so excited my
mels/021676.pt|where's the cringe you're giving somebody adds
mels/014060.pt|and they have out here for someone that like does the work of 10 people
mels/013618.pt|i clipped quite a few things that
mels/019811.pt|these he's got he's got good insights okay number eight number eight number eight number eight number eight now this is
mels/000562.pt|with the rooms and he says hey your friends aren't gambling we gave you these rooms
mels/011145.pt|and your kids are going to hang that up
mels/024221.pt|we've already watched if you're a die-hard marketing monday fan you've seen some of these ads but we're going to watch them
mels/018054.pt|in time sorry i have to pause
mels/031063.pt|and then i met him in person
mels/016743.pt|i think trying to imply that everyone's
mels/014275.pt|new strategy of grabbing groups not just people
mels/003765.pt|and i think if it was something we consistently
mels/012520.pt|my takeaway is if you really got into it like if you showed up in set in costume
mels/017627.pt|perhaps a poor online experience and and
mels/025226.pt|the party where they baked him a cake
mels/012858.pt|for esports i was like so i started actually
mels/006719.pt|oh there it is the veil here it is
mels/028237.pt|as smart and he's a good
mels/028119.pt|it on the nasdaq you could go into your app and trade phase stock that was the
mels/025325.pt|warlocks siphon life spell this is a
mels/023752.pt|geico 15 minutes could save you
mels/015262.pt|then eventually this debt is going to catch up with them because they're not
mels/003463.pt|which is like that's why it's so it's so important and strategic and interesting
mels/031594.pt|the game is so old but it is it is the most beautiful i mean it's a crazy game i when i was
mels/022184.pt|what makes it so silly is the gold this
mels/002900.pt|of the freeloaders and moochers out there okay because as we discussed in the netflix marketing monday
mels/022294.pt|so lovingly as sweet music plays
mels/018922.pt|it's meg whitman she ran for governor of california as a republican
mels/009836.pt|the outsells every other car or truck by a
mels/003830.pt|right now it's used for a lot of misinformation so maybe i
mels/004197.pt|can can mine be like do you accept chatters as db friends what is db these balls damn get
mels/031538.pt|just stop him from mining that's what his plan was and flash
mels/005380.pt|tomorrow we were doing a review of what it's like for
mels/027184.pt|last week to absolutely enormous critical success one of the highest rated games of all time a true instant classic
mels/006937.pt|imagine everything i'm saying right now there's
mels/022621.pt|cast as angry gamer oh my god so
mels/020941.pt|okay he actually brought it home a little bit in the end but i think in general it's
mels/013312.pt|well i'm starting to sense this is
mels/009271.pt|be commenting on every single thing you hear about from nvidia because that
mels/012134.pt|at different side because then i could see we could share stuff back and forth and
mels/020904.pt|well all right now someone in
mels/010969.pt|so let's watch the latest trailer for minions rise of
mels/011202.pt|as that's why i'm so impressed wait i
mels/022181.pt|the powerball ticket is that the lesson go dig up grandma's
mels/025926.pt|google games of all time in
mels/003909.pt|i mean these people kind of
mels/020245.pt|let's do it the best holiday ads
mels/026330.pt|nine million dollars nine to twelve million dollars opening a new store verizon spends four hundred thousand a
mels/022104.pt|with a customer's name awesome job
mels/007608.pt|and that was the cool part that was the coolest part about
mels/016805.pt|if the for inflation so you guys don't think it's
mels/024248.pt|isn't there but i think as an ad i don't think you watch that
mels/011277.pt|i mean that's kind of weird surely yeah just
mels/015134.pt|a concept used to determine how big your business audit idea can be for example if you come up with an idea that's like really good for welders
mels/008246.pt|and living off of jimmy john's and living off of carl's jr and helped me get a
mels/018697.pt|i just came and said hey you have us now they would still only go to
mels/028833.pt|the story i think i have
mels/017935.pt|you know it's very easy to just be a shitty team and get your cut of the nfl
mels/008089.pt|my ancestors when they got chained up and
mels/001140.pt|you're hungry we could start early
mels/016156.pt|sorry i'm trying to spread the news thanks
mels/023760.pt|this is a long time ago when i
mels/027365.pt|then it for all their games so if it passes d3
mels/007035.pt|and i wouldn't even had one to play with if i didn't have that so
mels/008397.pt|like one of the oldest courts in the
mels/025562.pt|john deere hopefully will have to actually negotiate with
mels/013457.pt|for money even if he's living at your home hustle
mels/028175.pt|in a million dollars a year to face a company
mels/013985.pt|i pay later companies please be careful of them
mels/001576.pt|you promise not to cheat on this following question
mels/027301.pt|in together it feels like you're part of something and number two is
mels/001124.pt|or to see some of their their stuff pop up and it's like their entire shtick is
mels/002652.pt|which was like a month ago thank you ceo of
mels/005921.pt|i about that dude how do we not
mels/011740.pt|in person that i meet is from naboo
mels/026126.pt|literally one of the worst ceos you
mels/030443.pt|day the day of the puzzle valentine's day we're in
mels/011431.pt|nine months the king is back dude i'm back baby i'm streaming so what's cool is this week a lot of people from the big end nvidia are on vacation
mels/031423.pt|this was the problem okay this dog came with a family which came with kids two kids to be specific who were the neighbors okay the neighbors who apparently did not know this house
mels/025529.pt|in sony is ready to buy game companies they're
mels/022266.pt|if the world with my best friend
mels/016901.pt|exponentially the future of work looks way more decentralized many more people are going to be making money through online creation or talking about things
mels/003026.pt|in the theater which is also something i
mels/003092.pt|at american consumers have never felt this financially insecure since they started recording the data this trend is getting very bad
mels/030212.pt|it was right here i was right here i was
mels/022373.pt|the logo out bro that is not that
mels/007569.pt|was like it was like it was
mels/000441.pt|oh i remember what happened as i remember what happened
mels/018836.pt|there's no stakes it's just him grilling he's
mels/031195.pt|well it wasn't very funny or interesting so it wasn't but now ludwig has shown how to do it
mels/025604.pt|in google and they were called fang but
mels/024713.pt|well with others without this without this outcry
mels/008063.pt|i have a sneaking feeling that
mels/002245.pt|their their way of making a splash is elon musk they may have elon musk build a cult of personality using company funds you know
mels/006734.pt|sign anything because i just thought i know
mels/018642.pt|do you think there's a conflict in competition in
mels/012905.pt|told me to go to blizzard every single person my parents my fiance
mels/009118.pt|the new ways of stupid that i can't even comprehend it it baffled me at first
mels/013290.pt|means you have invited me to the wedding and i
mels/020947.pt|you got 12 likes and people don't
mels/012130.pt|but it's not like they had no ideas like it was a cool idea so so yeah we shoot the ship the ship stops
mels/031461.pt|yeah hanging out with lud he's being a pretty inattentive dog friend
mels/021107.pt|it's not like i'm not gonna i'm not
mels/030166.pt|third one i got the i got the
mels/009922.pt|i swear to god dude i feel like i'm so
mels/020761.pt|it is the overall most important person in marketing for the year
mels/009719.pt|people it's not it's not presenting the right look
mels/024644.pt|while ghost cities where there's like these big shoddily made skyscrapers and
mels/020260.pt|it's not the right play now number three
mels/015437.pt|that was too far for the brand
mels/014540.pt|the questions or just give it a talk but i am going to end fairly soon because
mels/005799.pt|what else happened oh yeah and then we talked a little bit
mels/007703.pt|but i watch it today it was surprisingly surprisingly entertaining surprisingly invested for not liking
mels/022780.pt|bank of america acquired countrywide which is a mortgage lending
mels/003269.pt|if there's an actual win okay because
mels/030756.pt|i feel it today we're off to a stupid start and that means it's only going to get
mels/016675.pt|these are springing up left and right pillow
mels/015906.pt|whoever wins prizes are going up i
mels/019187.pt|in them for game console they had won so hard
mels/025703.pt|with a huge price tag were not successful
mels/006992.pt|where i get to that um
mels/026229.pt|they don't want to they say everything's easy fun smile clean app if you miss any
mels/018728.pt|and so what we have now is better games if rachel buys and a playstation okay and joins the blue man group ross and chandler are gonna buy it too so they can game with her okay and eventually they're all gonna buy it whoever gets out to an early lead snowballs this has been proven for every console generation i was
mels/024959.pt|it's basically what i got for today
mels/023708.pt|it's weird to add the the recruiter cards like this is
mels/027228.pt|isn't entirely different itch so what
mels/029539.pt|in rules smash four is gonna
mels/019877.pt|at the top four here number four on the most overhyped games of all time star wars battlefront is a perfect number
mels/011321.pt|i haven't heard you say own the libs like a thousand
mels/002344.pt|will be like listen it's i
mels/011793.pt|it looks like you're taking off
mels/005558.pt|in her friends and i drove but apparently there was a shuttle that was sent there like a shuttle
mels/015849.pt|when the last boomer's grave a single tier
mels/008810.pt|it actually is very specifically not a breakup like whenever you want fee and twitter is asking for the full thing they're not like hey you can just take that but at the very least i think he's
mels/001830.pt|in materials and water and everything needed to make it it seems like it's a very daunting task that may not come to real fruition but they sure are paying a lot of people to work on it i was reading that people
mels/016921.pt|if you can get six months
mels/003941.pt|and they run the movie back in theaters
mels/011389.pt|whether or not disney stole five
mels/000792.pt|i want to pay for one
mels/001507.pt|in the past i'm going to say like three months like of this year ordering food has gotten out of control bonanza is expensive
mels/013814.pt|and then they thought about it for more than a minute and realized we gotta we gotta make
mels/032390.pt|it so much easier than in a pantheon my first attempt and for many of my first attempts i was
mels/031887.pt|well you got your phone behind your date's head and you're actually watching
mels/004304.pt|it's like i am quiet i am i can you can hear me
mels/014471.pt|a lot of people that he talked to told him to pick one of the
mels/001169.pt|the highest spending customer but it was a
mels/023678.pt|where to send me hearts bro and then she said give your driver's health
mels/003979.pt|have we ever had an entirely bald
mels/031592.pt|so that's why i think broodware's so
mels/002822.pt|but there's actual business reasons talking about
mels/013516.pt|which perhaps from ma'am breast breast like hill
mels/004484.pt|a slippery slope so true and wise actually
mels/027295.pt|so like the entire community when the game releases is is
mels/025617.pt|i opened a store where you could get free burrito codes in chipotle in roblox
mels/031437.pt|it was about here it goes about here and i know
mels/015658.pt|it all the streaming services the biggest winners the biggest upside prime and netflix
mels/014877.pt|one thing that really impressed me was that phil
mels/026027.pt|thank you for introducing us into the wonders
mels/025940.pt|not only from the player base but from the developer like valve
mels/004675.pt|you're pretty confident in that in that direction
mels/025234.pt|if you guys know a week or two ago they banned people under
mels/020796.pt|is the brand from a marketer's
mels/015918.pt|in most countries netflix has been raising prices already you can only raise prices like that and still grow if you have a very high perceived value people have to really think you're you're delivering a lot of
mels/028006.pt|as improving rapidly because they see the
mels/019916.pt|all these full page ads in every
mels/015509.pt|in dollars the most valuable company on
mels/004574.pt|thus saving myself a decent amount of cash as we're
mels/021961.pt|so you want to be a great editor or for example i think
mels/015072.pt|if they have no competition they have everything and
mels/021934.pt|if i yoink a jet a joke from chat this
mels/018388.pt|you're saying that they can only afford to pay you a thousand dollars a month that's not true
mels/027138.pt|the government has been continually lowering interest rates to try and juice the economy and then after
mels/000286.pt|was it a room with two beds by myself for the first
mels/003550.pt|it's just like it's like i guess a way to cope but
mels/031534.pt|an aggressive like all in usually like he splits the whole map and just turtles up and gets a gigantic army and you can't beat him but here he is going all out trying to get a
mels/011589.pt|it's stupid says something similar i can no longer hold that opinion the internet ruins opinions for me because i'm like i know that you're
mels/020986.pt|and give their get their thoughts and reviews
mels/012531.pt|me myself if it was me myself i don't know
mels/024526.pt|oh an unduly large part of the trial was
mels/012080.pt|and i start to find out all my boys who
mels/028840.pt|i remember i remember i was
mels/012346.pt|just been told that you have to use your galactic grabbers well you're a little bit
mels/003934.pt|and he's also a loon in
mels/000957.pt|no i am not streaming the bachelor party
mels/002173.pt|i cyber looked up every single person at twitch that was
mels/005974.pt|i didn't know i didn't know he was actually good at
mels/019886.pt|watch the games this is early days of games media we still had magazines for christ's sake and you could pay off those magazines
mels/021485.pt|they still have to that's what
mels/009157.pt|are any of your highest viewed videos lower than a five out of ten i'm not sure what you're saying one out of ten
mels/005288.pt|no expectations outside of what i've seen at smash events that anyone will even
mels/000732.pt|as two three five four five and gets a 21.
mels/026326.pt|in dollars to open this is
mels/021793.pt|really solid i'm gonna put it in solid number nine on youtube trending
mels/005359.pt|not reacting i'm stone-faced and he's looking right
mels/026123.pt|it's time to actually get into the marketing monday is that true my
mels/002741.pt|up again i mean that i'm sorry
mels/022134.pt|was managing the email as before i
mels/021550.pt|he's only doing it because elon musk hates short sellers because short sellers try to tank tesla
mels/028524.pt|i don't feel well you know i
mels/023986.pt|pretty owner of only fans and he has 20 years
mels/010294.pt|the only reason lyric is like
mels/003832.pt|yeah i mean yeah i listen
mels/030765.pt|the tweet was flames and he gave me a billion dollars right there
mels/027154.pt|the hot potatoes landed here and they can either raise interest rates collapse the
mels/025015.pt|i just looked at all the game freak posts
mels/010430.pt|you to four thousand chatters who are all
mels/010318.pt|for where he's doing interviews of youtubers maybe i'd get jared leto's do for where he's doing interviews with youtubers maybe i can get jared leto do
mels/022582.pt|innovative ideas and technology here at the wearables division we're working on ways of bringing the playstation experience to all areas of your life building on the recent success of remote play and chair play and not to mention project morpheus we're about to take
mels/004852.pt|it the only place i saw my name cropped off anywhere on the internet
mels/019489.pt|could help get more marketing monday content to you it's that easy maybe hit the bell
mels/013898.pt|we will be good i'm not gonna
mels/018897.pt|war the news that's it quibby
mels/024261.pt|it's very real this is what luxury looks like this is what it feels like
mels/004329.pt|if i guess what's tom holland know about
mels/000004.pt|is that i chugged a bunch of red bulls
mels/014908.pt|the fact that he agreed to pay it is interesting so he agreed to
mels/024827.pt|the days of games having like relatively small level of pay to win like horse armor for two dollars are completely gone okay if you want to you should have no end
mels/020028.pt|hey i cucks look at the graph
mels/021574.pt|don't have so i don't know exactly how they did it but essentially like you want to buy carrots from me okay so i show you this one
mels/014694.pt|i'll give two shits hey one thing mods can you be extra harsh
mels/014785.pt|and receive invoices which is dope for me
mels/013686.pt|don't know jack dorsey ceo of twitter was a
mels/010004.pt|the problem is jake novak is completely sort of
mels/026728.pt|he was actually a good example because what platforms want to do
mels/027963.pt|are you see me has is kind of the perfect energy
mels/017356.pt|we're thinking so long term the company is already working with preschools to establish the foundation of tech education so that as our hiring demand
mels/024761.pt|i want that and just buy it everything you want is behind some sort of lottery system that adds excitement
mels/018071.pt|this game was a notorious flop
mels/015215.pt|so this is one of the things
mels/002848.pt|hundred million dollars something like that but she has done it so
mels/011298.pt|the fire integrity of game files we're gonna try
mels/006239.pt|will be someone who is not on time okay i all i hold the line at
mels/022833.pt|because if you want to know what he thinks about this they actually
mels/002346.pt|might as well just stay up but at
mels/027189.pt|now some of you i guess were two years old
mels/018398.pt|more specifically amazon luna let me
mels/023204.pt|it's very interesting because fruit juices are generally delicious
mels/013822.pt|in the console wars okay four
mels/025885.pt|was revealed at blizzard the immediate
mels/023271.pt|not only did she get all of them right
mels/018730.pt|at the same in fact being slightly
mels/003061.pt|in the front and me and stanz were in the back
mels/021521.pt|the concept it's just a way of attacking wealthy
mels/025596.pt|one announcement for the meta for some reason getting cut off is what really gets him
mels/005664.pt|false story because everyone was super duper
mels/008604.pt|they're like leaking the text messages uh here it is
mels/020946.pt|make money and then like a month in
mels/020885.pt|because chances are to get a
mels/003706.pt|a cool mop or you invent something that's cool and
mels/013581.pt|trying to figure it all out i'm
mels/027535.pt|the stage with that because i want you to know that like even if you are
mels/028980.pt|an awful and awful and sick and
mels/027977.pt|what are million dollars they have literally just
mels/010922.pt|we want to build something and it's uh you
mels/005742.pt|if the the smart but here's the butt
mels/011500.pt|it'd be an interesting movie but they sold it
mels/027886.pt|for the longest time it's been considered that
mels/010495.pt|actually didn't even like the movie that much if
mels/009099.pt|well the tell you about that i don't know
mels/018933.pt|want to spend the whole time
mels/001851.pt|i can busy and i'm busy
mels/003710.pt|take your money but they'll just they'll just outsell you
mels/015143.pt|almost everybody on earth and so netflix is really attempting to test that theory by spending way way way way way more money than they have for the past 10 years netflix has
mels/005773.pt|i'm gonna tell you this this is
mels/015253.pt|netflix does not have that their highest peak of churn is below the lowest of everybody else okay they start steady about two percent
mels/021849.pt|but from a long-term point of view focusing more on the business than on
mels/006124.pt|that being emotionally charged and incredibly close definitely pushed him
