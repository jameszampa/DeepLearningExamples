data/014671.wav|i told the brand i would not start until a few minutes after i'd gone live to let everyone filter in so
data/025766.wav|the harness that for your marketing in a way that doesn't make the audience feel cheated or angry or annoyed or jump scared then you may be able to find a
data/014435.wav|clumps of craters bouncing off each other yeah exactly that's why they're grabbing groups reddit killed digg yeah but
data/017073.wav|so the youtube is on hiatus temporarily
data/031688.wav|that i could pretend to like when they asked me what anime
data/018738.wav|that iphone flat okay it did extremely poorly based on for to into it didn't do terribly like it's that iphone flopped okay it did extremely poorly based on project
data/014685.wav|the discord ping didn't tell us anything

data/023791.wav|it's like like some of the all-time
data/013715.wav|i want to give him a dub for this because i looked
data/011526.wav|bare minimum effort of getting you to believe and
data/020903.wav|start to make money extremely slow and also
data/006030.wav|it was it was wild that's why i thought he was
data/021746.wav|what the special but it actually was a boring repost so the
data/010515.wav|the i'm also a fan of rick and morty right
data/022018.wav|is drawing attention three hours later the tweet was deleted i was waiting today i had a clock dude i
data/008788.wav|just don't want to do that the banks don't
data/032339.wav|the necessary a set remember this phrase remember the phrase that descending dark is essentially necessary to make radiant radiance and
data/009134.wav|the on twitter he might be a good person to run
data/017150.wav|we've never thought of crow workers
data/010841.wav|i am going to jungle turns out in smite there is no equivalent to
data/008225.wav|so you know the best thing that could happen in my mind is that joe biden
data/007418.wav|it's just it's it's you have to be comfortable walking up to a setup
data/029899.wav|and so we get kicked out of the venue we're all super drunk
data/031476.wav|he can't he still can't do that
data/028377.wav|that right now just say i'm busy i'm busy that's rude imagine you're
data/029516.wav|that helps you because i think i think
data/025622.wav|as a piece of branded property
data/007814.wav|listen i didn't get a chance to do it and i didn't get a chance to do it
data/009044.wav|together i'm not opposed can you say the code out loud so i can get in i only have one monitor you know what for you i will i will read the code out loud for all the one monitor andy's who are
data/020584.wav|is about like what this means for the brand
data/029087.wav|and i i i'm glad i did was lazy because my idea for my global emote was
data/004148.wav|it'd be the money dude you're
data/032059.wav|to get our you know deadlines to get
data/027171.wav|the print some kind of absurd amount on top of this and that would only further cause the problem
data/001694.wav|i don't remember grandpa joe being a perv i just remember him laying in bed while the mom his daughter works like a slave like she's working non-stop like three jobs to provide for everybody in this house and then the second
data/002945.wav|where was like i'm kind of interested and
data/013982.wav|people don't want to go into debt people want the freedom of choice he said a lot of things that were like fancy ways of saying we are just a credit card company under a different name with less protections he he was a very good
data/019572.wav|give them a bad idea too
data/021834.wav|little more direct you know they're not
data/008810.wav|it actually is very specifically not a breakup like whenever you want fee and twitter is asking for the full thing they're not like hey you can just take that but at the very least i think he's
data/005445.wav|maybe he doesn't have teeth that's one possible explanation
data/022531.wav|google like supplied the funds to make this movie happen
data/021346.wav|it is time to talk about game
data/022416.wav|it's just these are just good it's creative the kid's breaking very very good very
data/028621.wav|and he thought i wouldn't get it
data/009132.wav|buying twitter i said look hey twitter's
data/010501.wav|is deservedly illegal and i'm against the war on drugs you should be locked up for what you're smoking if you think firefly
data/025358.wav|i pull out the the to the laptop and they pulled up they took a laptop and they
data/024201.wav|to let somebody big go they did it with ninja they let ninja go it didn't hurt
data/013650.wav|somebody had to say it and somebody had to do it okay
data/012756.wav|you know what i'm saying like the to put in that much time and be
data/027185.wav|additionally it's been phenomenally commercially successful it's not just
data/022609.wav|now it's time to show you an april
data/007936.wav|chatter around like bones what do you
data/019483.wav|the shameless ads of all time i hate that ad and also it's aged quite
data/031192.wav|which started that was just in
data/026831.wav|this year well over that closer to 7 million
data/003829.wav|it's concessions from the parties that win the election and it could lead to progress i do think the internet as a positive force for change could lead to something as something people could use to organize
data/027507.wav|i mean look this is the peak is rather it launched
data/006902.wav|studio apartment that i had mold in it because sf
data/019107.wav|at real i don't like it i don't want to watch more of this this makes me
data/001043.wav|it was just a text group
data/009768.wav|interesting and insightful get smarter saturday videos here on the channel
data/011986.wav|and they send you the code you can go and open that
data/023212.wav|by the way his music video if you
data/025698.wav|and the movie downloading system in the world
data/010803.wav|it's really good you have to go see it and you just have to tell me what yeah
data/002888.wav|which man on earth 20 billion dollars cash
data/028134.wav|nobody wants to do it again so instead of being public right now
data/015106.wav|best buy the dip of all time by
data/030834.wav|you later in life that's right i expect to see you in chat
data/001789.wav|got a smoothie in one hand
data/014312.wav|start streaming and keep streaming on twitch the thing is like
data/000809.wav|so by the end of the night the the fat wallet is as thin as it was
data/023333.wav|second win is the following i
data/018824.wav|this is pretty forgettable right this is very
data/002816.wav|and whether or not i mean he's still he's saying he didn't do it he actually said not to do it in a very specific way
data/032058.wav|for this roast we had checkpoints
data/023196.wav|fuck you this one's for like real california types they'll say
data/003481.wav|you're going to be a dog
data/010269.wav|will be on my team because mango is of course team clint lyric is on my team handshake that's right i got that kind of pull now i just reached out to lyric myself and lyric said yeah so it's me and lyric guaranteed northern lion and connor would be sick
data/003502.wav|dollars and it's not going to be enough to really make an impact so we'll see
data/006433.wav|new full set of rune dragon hide armor
data/020320.wav|at the time is true now is true now
data/017600.wav|we stand out from their competitors so
data/025275.wav|with the pressure and then i found out that squid game is not like those other shows stranger things queen's gambit bird box
data/001227.wav|in the field and looking around at the
data/004068.wav|and months brando i can't believe we finally gave
data/030986.wav|bad but it was rent control that's all i could afford so i i would not leave it even when the
data/015737.wav|i did it for ted lasso i did
data/002844.wav|past judicial records what she has
data/006978.wav|all year or youtube and so you at
data/024288.wav|in that it's very obvious and the
data/016402.wav|printed out of thin air but our current inflation crisis that we're experiencing the higher gas prices
data/012937.wav|and then good social media and good influencers
data/014554.wav|and i don't think any deal like that makes sense for someone who doesn't even
data/009280.wav|what do you think one ad spot here costs
data/000236.wav|that you're celebrating and that's my brother so it's all of us against my
data/032288.wav|the edge so that that that that is the end of it and thank god so i'm sort of like at a pretty i'm like damn i lost i lost everything i mean i lost i lost every my entire limit i didn't i
data/027923.wav|with the that mark zuckerberg carefully ignored in order to get his engineers working on an nft solution for instagram really
data/015447.wav|going to have the same impact that disney has
data/019006.wav|she's only been around for a month or two i mean
data/024085.wav|the innovative side of fast food they're trying a lot of new things
data/019924.wav|it was like a kind of cooler quake clone if it had released when it was first announced so as boomer as it is if you look at the whole history of games
data/013287.wav|and i think they're pretty good although
data/020147.wav|a better than average commercial this is not bad at all
data/027665.wav|you plant three tomatoes for three dollars and then take the seeds from those and then plant them again until you get nine
data/000421.wav|he was like he was annoyed and like
data/000699.wav|everyone goes up to the bathroom one point except for lorenzo who's my
data/024647.wav|estate developer was posting huge profits and was saying they were worth more every year in fact it is very rare for a company to collapse after having the previous
data/004150.wav|we need you to send us
data/019471.wav|i guess i i was trying
data/015210.wav|there's a million new competitors that are driving up the cost of content they're already going into debt so
data/029343.wav|first things i ever do i got to see the set of law and order that was pretty cool it's like the city street they like film
data/024122.wav|if that worked in this project
data/025794.wav|if the best rated show ever and now
data/027362.wav|if the things that are required like to make sure this passes that test it has to be these
data/022023.wav|they get scared boom it's over shut it
data/012987.wav|we're like actually learning history all the time and then you learn something else all the time and then
data/024379.wav|am a little confused as to where the
data/023819.wav|good luck with the you're going down this year see in two weeks pal those were probably
data/007401.wav|it's not true i don't think people did that i think anyone flew out it was like ask skip topic i even though it's not true i i don't think people did that i don't think anyone flew out and was
data/014338.wav|is the future and makes their own streaming services and they did and so very
data/013364.wav|it would be nice if it gave me at least
data/008111.wav|well okay well then just next time he goes live you can go
data/006260.wav|cool cool cool cool cool cool you didn't react to the balloons
data/020468.wav|well when i took a look at the sales figures so i look at those and i found out that
data/001093.wav|actually had a really good freshman year at
data/028917.wav|there were certain i would throw up in their vehicle no soul taxi and again i've taken a lot of taxes
data/019457.wav|that pepsi ad it was bad it doesn't have the same iconic you guys
data/025247.wav|well i'm sorry to hear that and i hope you figure
data/027533.wav|the single dumbest thing that any company has done in all of social media ever the whole thing is it's actually crazy that they didn't even like try to fix
data/024756.wav|as consoles and pc and it takes all of these powerful psychological principles strips away all of like the annoying
data/014789.wav|kind of understands what a freelancer or side
data/021417.wav|i billionaires but anyway average people
data/017214.wav|if the the worst symptoms you
data/008186.wav|it's the weekend finally thank god
data/000408.wav|and over to another table of baccarat and
data/024828.wav|according to the game players of the
data/021566.wav|i don't know they'll fall off their moose who knows why would that matter
data/015315.wav|prime because of amazon prime video that's worth it they can throw as much money as they want
data/004515.wav|come on dude i feel like the bar is too low the bar is too low people it's
data/014473.wav|i got two offers one from blizzard and
data/020043.wav|i think he was interesting was that they said um
data/015954.wav|they should generate custom thumbnails and
data/019098.wav|he is a character right because he can do
data/029241.wav|it was up it was like it was a
data/003456.wav|one taiwan it would mean that every other country
data/016637.wav|way way cheaper and heading lower there is potential
data/005532.wav|i definitely smoked him what happened
data/020756.wav|suing facebook for being a illegal monopoly and i read the lawsuit took months to prepare
data/011556.wav|okay i'm a mark hamill joker lover
data/007545.wav|it was world war ii era struggle food
data/020419.wav|with the iconic because you're the customer and
data/003384.wav|what a joke yeah they grabbed his finger and
data/002986.wav|so we're looking around everyone's gonna
data/001536.wav|these guys are so stupid in my chat everyone's
data/006699.wav|they got six hours i mentioned
data/005288.wav|no expectations outside of what i've seen at smash events that anyone will even
data/008692.wav|it just seems very obviously like he is trying to find a reason that is publicly you know that
data/031494.wav|close but i actually think starcraft is the hardest deepest levels i i believe that i've not
data/018825.wav|very basic like hahaha vegetarians I mean
data/009916.wav|i have like actual legal power or a strong union that can sort of just negotiate in good faith have an actual power struggle you know so it's like they have to
data/019070.wav|in character as a depressed alcoholic horse and i lo i thought i mean the the
data/002305.wav|it's worth it i take 10 years off starting right
data/002923.wav|i literally watched it today it was just very forgettable it was fine i i watched it and i had my phone
data/027016.wav|after morgan stanley i yes of course i remember
data/030173.wav|lot of things we could compete at we did a lot of physical challenges so one of them was a foot race which we have a video of
data/031641.wav|it was like an extra special
data/031525.wav|well the understand and it's very blurry because
data/031334.wav|with the me and be like hey it's not that big a
data/020297.wav|it just didn't like the actor oh you mean in the ad you think in
data/006285.wav|to get rid of poster my dad so if you
data/020564.wav|the the come out but they'll be fine
data/024691.wav|are you want if you have been waiting to get into a stock
data/024960.wav|it's the world now this is a mini
data/022914.wav|what i love about this email exchange is how  cocky epic game sounds in
data/017474.wav|so i was actually really impressed with that
data/010926.wav|with minions rise of group for the minions pizza challenge and my understanding is that if you go to
data/018564.wav|lost the war hard as i mentioned
data/021740.wav|it's like you can like it ironically and you could like it
data/028592.wav|now i actually got higher than this but this is the only one they
data/023527.wav|so they just get a ton of money per car it's not as big of a business but it creates them
data/011081.wav|i get on the stream and i don't miss a day that's just me though but it sounds like
data/030139.wav|mexican standoff where everyone's unhappy no one's
data/001209.wav|don't you don't need to get started in marketing now if you're 19 and you're
data/026120.wav|there's a rise in general labor movements and they're having success and i just want to say personally that i deeply support these and if you in your own life have a
data/021348.wav|one out with all the money and then you're
data/023124.wav|so you don't know what the that is
data/027075.wav|that people would be talking about that
data/029861.wav|your house first of all you
data/010033.wav|six months oh my god i'm gonna have to hear someone say
data/002492.wav|way more pringles pringles defenders would be
data/025922.wav|it's a pickup on reddit people were like hey what the what the hell's this they dropped
data/029244.wav|seamlessly smoothly people in the crowd noticed
data/003843.wav|at the party that couches you know
data/003213.wav|the original something they would basically hire
data/025374.wav|and uh and then they let me do it
data/024267.wav|there were like wait a minute this is kind of boring what if we just have him sing
data/026267.wav|most people think it's advertising people think
data/005903.wav|the exact cost plus an extra for the interest since
data/017087.wav|yo slime machine is that big a okay for israel is that
data/020712.wav|they are still just as excited
data/018391.wav|we have a success story here in almost
data/020531.wav|in chug away this game until it's fixed i mean it's
data/009658.wav|handshakes that was a pretty dominant
data/018458.wav|i don't think i know him so i googled him he's a roblox youtuber
data/012546.wav|it was a cool idea the idea was cool and i could see it being if
data/023636.wav|emergencies agencies like ice it just feels so inauthentic and
data/022099.wav|in response applebee's fired the server so right in the middle
data/001949.wav|week vacation from work and it was just
data/024427.wav|it's full of water i mean
data/024445.wav|we're now it's uh innovative and i'm impressed
data/011426.wav|the a resume if you have
data/014124.wav|big company was getting into this they didn't understand how this market worked and it was assumed that if you bought the biggest people their audience would transfer over it was proven very quickly but not after all these guys got their bag
data/009904.wav|go down you probably would go complain people are just like
data/013294.wav|no you're not invited this would not hold up in court
data/026755.wav|these are the largest remaining targets all of these are smaller than activision blizzard which means they are all financially on the table
data/031527.wav|he's the best player to ever touch a keyboard
data/019345.wav|was going for all of them enron 2 wanted everything this is where
data/009991.wav|takes balls it takes delusion or self-confidence and stanz is very
data/026613.wav|marketing monday on a tuesday not necessarily an uncommon thing lately but we have big news today emergency marketing monday microsoft just purchased activision blizzard for a whopping
data/004893.wav|but i'll give you the long and short
data/027336.wav|it killed him he wasn't even hard and i died a couple of times just don't play the
data/031941.wav|we're talking about it and then when they find out what's going on
data/031322.wav|i tell me they caught me on tape he he put a water bottle back he was stealing water and i'm like no no no i i
data/000438.wav|good time that's already a fantastic night but if you start winning more money
data/022529.wav|with vince vaughn and owen wilson you probably don't cause no one watched it this was literally like
data/020162.wav|god damn based it actually is
data/008963.wav|the termination fee quote unquote is if something happens
data/003933.wav|there was a third party candidate
data/018811.wav|hey as boring zombies suits as the
data/024564.wav|you for a cut the thing is that's
data/013490.wav|it was so much worse when i played league like when she actually this is
data/006121.wav|with the context cody had already said on
data/015721.wav|one time you know i think that's there's a good
data/020487.wav|the witcher uh battle arena is another
data/013901.wav|but that's not and you know part of the problem is i
data/019160.wav|studied I don't want to study show me
data/010170.wav|so rapid that they just like
data/017997.wav|in the country but they have you know like supreme court
data/011631.wav|she's a fan of and she
data/020216.wav|it's creepy surprise and put it on the menu
data/007138.wav|or two seats from me i
data/003152.wav|is completely lost facing three different tornadoes

data/029479.wav|and if you want to know that twitch story you can find it on you can find it on youtube i told my twitch story the
data/031922.wav|one pitched in but we were in this area we were in like the the
data/026515.wav|it's largely because of like uh almost like
data/021994.wav|some of the saddest commercials of all time
data/009875.wav|so which is crazy it's the same state
data/027018.wav|no it's not each rate is no longer a unique selling point it's on trending i
data/026008.wav|will face jail time which is super unfortunate
data/027798.wav|a crazy time right now but
data/006418.wav|imagination of the future on linkedin let me read it for you okay
data/019991.wav|built this whole expanded universe and it led to an insane insane insane amount of money
data/017755.wav|the clock to get a huge brand
data/017377.wav|one from a small share to now they are literally
data/009706.wav|what i said in my title was
data/011960.wav|after this happens i get a text message from
data/020027.wav|buying android everything cratered and now the world is literally divided between android and ios so if you want to put anything out on mobile you have to use google play are you have to use ios there is buying android everything cratered and now the world is literally divided between android and ios so if you want to put anything out on mobile you have to use google play or you have to use ios there is no other option is
data/017456.wav|why at night but the striking
data/014468.wav|his podcast where i think it goes into more detail and we had a lot of talks about it and the advice that i gave him was that because he was telling me that a lot of people were telling his podcast where i think he goes into more detail and we had a lot of talks about it and
data/011355.wav|i'm just saying the one thing i agree with
data/015253.wav|netflix does not have that their highest peak of churn is below the lowest of everybody else okay they start steady about two percent
data/010945.wav|ari helped yeah she helped i'll give her that i
data/010291.wav|i might ask charlie i might
data/002660.wav|he was a french naturalist biologist academic and a proponent of evolution and then

data/019802.wav|great big media franchise uh anyway

data/016775.wav|there were people that are age 65 and

data/031507.wav|players make perfect moves they make mistakes it's not
data/021748.wav|we as don't know my history with jimmy john's
data/006200.wav|i'm so tired of it it's just like a whole month you know
data/013093.wav|sort of very supper every summer every suburb today thank
data/020084.wav|what he called next apple's acquisition of next
data/006630.wav|with him dude it was depressing either way god what a miserable game dude at the
data/031229.wav|it's early by the way for for me
data/009277.wav|why are the bosses so short it's crazy
data/011326.wav|well yeah chad it's okay i've been i've
data/009217.wav|what's that everybody wants to blame their team and they
data/022922.wav|biggest game on playstation as you know many companies are exploring
data/031023.wav|i laugh he was like no no no no
data/032372.wav|it's so much easier for me it was so much easier and the actually it's what made me so frustrated because i would play for example radiant um pure vessel to practice i could beat
data/014050.wav|and so i think they've they've made a big mistake by allowing him to go to
data/027550.wav|thank you a seat on our board the board of
data/017926.wav|watch one because you want to see more about
data/026311.wav|with the time and that has allowed them i
data/013300.wav|iraq can i be your best man no it
data/010267.wav|my team but then they asked clint to be his
data/025470.wav|mean actual win this week not because of
data/007448.wav|we had a good time i don't know if
data/009262.wav|that i saw before i went live uh
data/024057.wav|we'll see if they can solve that what's the solution i mean listen they're printing money hand over fist they are making an absolutely insane
data/003355.wav|if the situation if people don't pay their mortgages then we get a big widespread
data/005181.wav|it was the day before july 4th it was
data/010838.wav|the through that at like later tonight and then
data/004767.wav|people started to think wait a minute you know let's look at the numbers here
data/024304.wav|proud of this whoever made this whatever agency made this should feel like
data/012273.wav|and then some kid over there
data/006738.wav|well laughed at me because they're both pros
data/026277.wav|if you're wondering so so how if they don't spend
data/009735.wav|it won't like it'll just damage my nails but without
data/017679.wav|what allowed apple to get a massive head start in the
data/016497.wav|both working about the same difficulty the industry they got in is bigger than any
data/022849.wav|where is scott aaron's now i just i saw
data/020979.wav|and they have like a team
data/002349.wav|if you need a video of me wishing you
data/006522.wav|i only did this and apple was doing it as one
data/009182.wav|i definitely get mauled and i'm i'm way
data/020587.wav|not be honest and say this was a good launch
data/012570.wav|when i like got the sponsorship they made me like an
data/008628.wav|if they don't they're not getting their packages and
data/004473.wav|you know that's what i'll say is
data/008386.wav|i actually read pretty much the whole good
data/020626.wav|if the golden arches campaign where they move the two sides of the
data/004949.wav|just a huge song and dance back and forth with elon musk that has made them both look bad
data/019850.wav|massive massive marketing spend it was
data/031497.wav|i think that i think that i think the people that got the best
data/018979.wav|to make it this was the competition this was not the competition and also even if this was the competition you got beat because guess what
data/022392.wav|how cool this guy is rub off on your brand and
data/001758.wav|the underground cellar the moral is don't gamble i guess yeah well i'm going to vegas
data/025439.wav|he salutes his own digital character who
data/004199.wav|if vague like anything could have gone bad in another universe ever heard of man in
data/009121.wav|and then you just start getting so many more
data/017699.wav|users who have bought apple products have used
data/000257.wav|if the we're going to be there so now we
data/005344.wav|of their seats i think the show's doing its
data/025076.wav|sugary cereal but now it's whole grain guaranteed so you know it's healthy i'm just
data/016663.wav|we are extremely valuable uh in
data/024020.wav|in this is again my theory but um
data/007208.wav|then eight months passed he never he never messed me again apparently he
data/026893.wav|actually not wrong right after after they paid for the
data/014105.wav|well let me get to this
data/008833.wav|there's nobody on earth that rich
data/019666.wav|and then made the song the hook and everything
data/022727.wav|light the world on fire just so we don't forget microsoft acquired all these buildings
data/014868.wav|as we start getting a position of power
data/001861.wav|like whenever i talk to him
data/012351.wav|i tried blue milk yeah i tried blue milk and green milk i tried everything
data/026682.wav|which is projections were like yeah this is how
data/016311.wav|and like eight times more likely than average private business but four times
data/020679.wav|if they've calmed down a bit the night never ends we have a fourth award a lot of my awards go to the huge companies the big games the big marketers but we always put one award in for the little guy that's why this award goes to the surprise indie no marketing hit of the year
data/000666.wav|filled with i mean talking about racks we just had a ton of money in that fanny pack and it was filled with the brim with
data/032326.wav|that they the little hint of don't
data/018022.wav|so let me show you for the last part of the stream in honor of in-game advertising good and
data/024710.wav|federal officials trading stocks and we should have more accountability and they should have to sell their stocks it's very interesting that that
data/007021.wav|well i've ever had it's so clean it matches the hat
data/007370.wav|they showed but like we were we were we were we were
data/029867.wav|in other plane another plane not even though
data/025522.wav|the xbox and nintendo and i'm sticking to it i think they've uh withstood some of
data/019056.wav|well like i i don't even type it i say it
data/016087.wav|you found this is a spoon it appears
data/024591.wav|and appear naked in court and the judge
data/015952.wav|and you keep finding new stuff to watch you're
data/025178.wav|and then you guys also needed a tagline because i don't know anything about how
data/019329.wav|hi all the time love eric by the way in a true example of nepotism we
data/009760.wav|it's fun i'll tell you that
data/028141.wav|so they spent about 80 million they made
data/022106.wav|noticed happen again and again never ever ever do anything at all that involves ai or fan submissions ever because you get this i had to censor these
data/023369.wav|and he posted this and i was looking at it and i was like wait this is wrong
data/029330.wav|if the guy that's trying to help me out the the wb
data/022629.wav|with the time so i had no
data/031420.wav|the beach you know just like surveying the landscape just like perfect form you know just like not even flexing but the guns are
data/002441.wav|it's a common phrase if you're talking about who's the big kahuna burger in a game it's the biggest
data/029383.wav|the champion by heart i know league in and out and then they're talking about current events and world stuff and not even like deep lore of elon musk just like stuff in the news about elon musk and i go yeah yeah
data/015652.wav|on a laptop is this powerful does this sum it up does this feel like
data/007673.wav|tell me true tell me honestly
data/002993.wav|or prickling up a little bit i start you know what the
data/004074.wav|with the great message that's like
data/023076.wav|that makes me hungry and i constantly have to find new food to fill that gap and marketers can compete basically through differentiation in their brands to get me to buy it i want you to compare this to tech real quick i want you to imagine that you are a rich gamer like the kind of gamer
data/015389.wav|it was in the early days of the pandemic okay the
data/007547.wav|that was one of the worst parts by the way that was one of the worst parts was that was
data/000409.wav|in the middle of one hand and i'm drunk and
data/017354.wav|i that's good that's good that's good stuff
data/023152.wav|or deleting it and it got me thinking about like all the pressure there is from all these like glossy burgers in the fast food magazines to look good and
data/017827.wav|and you don't think about that when you're when you're thinking about advertising and marketing for
data/019235.wav|the DS is your is your childhood console
data/027751.wav|future and Fortune to slightly increase
data/007300.wav|and would win none was like the favorite he was higher seed he's more well known he's beaten music
data/000529.wav|but it was a lot of the same people last time we were in vegas
data/003155.wav|the dark knight apple is the joker apple is also a bad guy here who is tracking users and creating their own ad network they found out by calling it privacy they can just steal all the money that facebook was making every other app requires
data/000265.wav|it is nice but i i hope he understands that if he had no money i would still the
data/021704.wav|of to help your parents keep you comfy so yeah
data/002218.wav|or hard anyway the first employee question was about like more vacation days or something basically he's like we used to have these things called meta days
data/006736.wav|even slightly bigger i've never gone outside
data/027119.wav|at a level never before seen and now it's at all time colossal crazy banana bears
data/007294.wav|i don't have it um listen throughout the so from the
data/016600.wav|like that is a free cheat card
data/001891.wav|what are you mean do about it
data/027444.wav|can you imagine being taco bell
data/012338.wav|want a spaceship right now you wouldn't we
data/027806.wav|it's been happening for years and years and years and we've been enjoying it because it's been leading to everything spike businesses that don't really have a good business plan can survive for a very long time by continuing to raise more money as long as you were growing nobody really cared whether you
data/008541.wav|unravel everything which means to do that that means twitter goes back to how
data/012024.wav|it was of athleticism and or skill
data/004167.wav|in which case hell yes hell yeah brother crawl
data/029151.wav|what there's no sale i just played for
data/009695.wav|i ordered my quincy plushie fingers
data/012699.wav|you'll have to do it too and then you'll get extra addicted because when your friends
data/028913.wav|very ill the alcohol is way way too much
data/016574.wav|when somebody who works in cyber security or
data/022244.wav|my experience kids locked away from a family event on
data/027046.wav|big lord of the rings fan much bigger than me and she saw this ad and she had been really excited for the show and she said this ad kind of killed her hype i
data/020995.wav|give me your votes for the snickers
data/031719.wav|was translations is the company who
data/008904.wav|well of the memes about that jordan peterson clip all the different edits i want to do it for a video and i will pay you i will pay you i
data/032297.wav|by clip popping off actually made it to the top of
data/016679.wav|because this is way way too late for them
data/021830.wav|the quite a good writer especially the first half of this book is all letters to shareholders they basically found every later he ever sent to amazon shareholders where he was convincing them to give him the quite a good writer especially the first half of this book is all letters to shareholders they basically found every letter he ever sent to amazon shareholders where he was
data/015256.wav|it's something that you don't necessarily think about it's uh it's just something that
data/009535.wav|i this might go wrong tyler look at
data/029644.wav|when it's like this this shot music video
data/011672.wav|so when you're driving up to you're like
data/011433.wav|so she'll be gone so it's
data/006997.wav|i think the first like gaming
data/012992.wav|at the piano or you want
data/007072.wav|be really nice to everybody because
data/001389.wav|abraham before what is that this is a bible reference
data/012305.wav|and i'm dejected obviously because i
data/031474.wav|you know this was definitely not something you could do every day
data/019187.wav|in them for game console they had won so hard
data/031107.wav|at the time that's one of the reasons i was telling him not to be so rushed because
data/001874.wav|at the tragic twitch has been
data/001147.wav|one of the did you already drink it
data/030246.wav|set up on his kitchen counter my computer literally like he had a kitchen island
data/014403.wav|well let me put it this way me and ludwig both hire a guy named phineas j to do our vaude channel
data/017764.wav|of twitch how does he do that what is different about him he doesn't have
data/013538.wav|sit down and they would feel uncomfortable leaving early so the entire lunch hour he would just beat them with mail and
data/013250.wav|when your career nobody makes it on
data/022760.wav|billion dollars a little under one billion okay
data/001251.wav|yeah but she has to do everything herself and it
data/029670.wav|at do have we used to gloss over it dude that's right i need the
data/018718.wav|with the hardware they're putting in there it's a price so low that consumers stop doing comparisons they stop thinking about well this one has this benefit
data/028217.wav|good articles oh man you're so great just talking all
data/002521.wav|now remember if you win this you can walk away with
data/028026.wav|it's been progress with the amazon union progress
data/002334.wav|wait here on twitch what's the meta now
data/026927.wav|in pretty solvent being dead honest with
data/000428.wav|and i'm doing this all night and
data/005273.wav|the to make a big deal out of it and
data/000185.wav|why the details of the plot of the movie the hangover that we watched on night one
data/017975.wav|if you guys don't know there's a leak
data/029186.wav|democracy to the anarchists the mere inclusion of this mode was appalling
data/027797.wav|actually the third outcome is both
data/002057.wav|lives at home and has a dangling cross earring and then she got zero likes
data/027623.wav|chinese propaganda arm and in fact when this book a collection of speeches by
data/025062.wav|i use sugary nestle formula they specifically gave people a free a month of free
data/013215.wav|if anything they're too thin now they're too small too nimble
data/001213.wav|there's a lot of like online small businesses if you were if you had a unique
data/006723.wav|what breed is my my girlfriend's begging to ask you excuse me
data/000342.wav|well he he didn't get the whole anyway i'm gonna
data/028700.wav|and at one of those tournaments
data/004397.wav|i had a good laugh okay
data/024969.wav|worldwide is sony and so i looked into it and it's most people
data/015976.wav|and so we have to understand is that the strategy for all
data/013796.wav|it's the robot uprising in five years when tesla's self-driving cars go to war with the rest of us rats with guns on exercise balls is the
data/006177.wav|he stole my trademark on the in-run logo
data/024488.wav|is to lose and i think in some ways we all work in
data/024745.wav|but everything else combined today mobile is now bigger than pc and console and cloud and vr combined how did they do that how
data/031349.wav|required some sort of thing and uh she's
data/030206.wav|our money matches he had to
data/025690.wav|rorschach inkblot test the ad doesn't
data/031222.wav|math and they compete and there's judges and then that's how it goes all right we had the best
data/013374.wav|actually the most ever this is the most tweets we've ever had on a best tweets and they are all
data/028072.wav|i like that video because it made me think like
data/022418.wav|but it was one of the first ads that opened my eyes to this whole
data/023986.wav|pretty owner of only fans and he has 20 years
data/010498.wav|well rushed um i really want another season it's the
data/008217.wav|messaging but obviously i i would prefer them over the party that is
data/030470.wav|and then i the true facts all right facts we were
data/015725.wav|i think if you watch this marketing monday
data/003499.wav|so like once it's already established
data/015766.wav|and they make so much money off theatrical releases and time delay and costing extra that they're just having a tough time getting the stones
data/028481.wav|my dad is his superior officer
data/032226.wav|i i i am like wow ludwig who's got more money
data/007190.wav|watch like all the best sheiks i would watch all their vods on the flights
data/021300.wav|creators of the at the top point one
data/031332.wav|in my dad's credit the first thing he did when he landed
data/004185.wav|it's the web but we're we're getting there okay the point is we're getting there and we're
data/018075.wav|isn't right now it's the refreshing taste of
data/022595.wav|full speed into the wall of the pool
data/002706.wav|okay here's an idea here's a catch here's
data/002900.wav|of the freeloaders and moochers out there okay because as we discussed in the netflix marketing monday
data/027414.wav|that the free version exists in fact they
data/018025.wav|one of the first fully branded video games of all time i have heard that this
data/027434.wav|zero likes and this was promoted in my feed like i was seeing this
data/030934.wav|job and they saw the security footage
data/012103.wav|if we have to stop it we have to they're
data/014021.wav|how many bundles left but yes if
data/028423.wav|one point he was the commander of the
data/022769.wav|and buy dallas mavericks and he's never
data/016522.wav|make in idaho you know over a year that's if you
data/007212.wav|if you want to do it and he's like hell yeah
data/030726.wav|we're going to end with the
data/023173.wav|it's literally frozen anyway one one more thing that
data/016008.wav|will be fine they're like all right cool here's the money and they just kept handing them money
data/007711.wav|that's crazy way to phrase it but i get it if i could reverse men in black a language and just get it in my brain i mean spanish because then
data/010874.wav|it's just keep doubling down every single time focused up
data/013755.wav|read pillar of gaming community and then in the past few years have completely trashed their entire reputation image and future while riot is on an
data/024746.wav|astronomical revenues so quickly they have a more effective way of
data/010604.wav|i gotta say this again later
data/026425.wav|how does he do that what is different about him he doesn't have you know he doesn't chill for primes every every minute like
data/013669.wav|why why wouldn't we just call it
data/032277.wav|and everybody i mean even jess
data/020509.wav|into the biggest launch of all time let's say they offer a new game let's say their next
data/020289.wav|the content of the ad and not the fact that it was literally like next pixel
data/004171.wav|is that beijing nowadays there's so much interesting news out of china
data/016594.wav|three billion dollars and have a lot of big
data/017159.wav|one hat i want you to scream we're actually bringing them back one
data/019348.wav|to find this presentation because it
data/006257.wav|of the greatest gaming moments in history where one man his chimp and a series of darts shot
data/011238.wav|i get it i see your game plan
data/021428.wav|what they don't take the money so how do they make money
data/002835.wav|and if they back out he can't be forced
data/015496.wav|it's because the market doesn't think disney can keep growing at the way
data/026701.wav|close to ready uh fans absolutely despise the massive
data/031157.wav|were exercised you know like watch anime till
data/004219.wav|it's no longer worthy of big praise i think it's fine it's fine i mean i'm glad they did it's just not that brave
data/002224.wav|at twitch the ceo would give a whole speech about something and
data/020083.wav|number one the greatest acquisition of all time is when apple acquired this guy and his company his company
data/025983.wav|what the up with a w first win of the week goes to a
data/028448.wav|is important this is the gun in screenwriting
data/002851.wav|the core of chancery is a very business focused
data/003239.wav|war though the sharp eyes of readers out there
data/011381.wav|like let me get my uh
data/004726.wav|the normal and standard and i'm sure many many people do it
data/025359.wav|i pulled up my social media and they went like tweet by tweet looking for anything wrong in my history they went through my entire like media history in front of me to see if
data/009913.wav|while the ceos to be kind then we have that's the
data/015257.wav|i have to have and if they can keep that default position and reduce churn it gives them a massive advantage of everybody else because even if someone else gets a hit it's like they keep netflix they sign up for the new service they watch the show and they leave they don't they don't drop netflix for that new thing and keep it
data/024928.wav|you can have a lock based game you can have a
data/013498.wav|doing any kind of positive hard thing gives us
data/028792.wav|no seriously i mean i i just thought i'd rather just
data/015893.wav|is not very good at enforcing antitrust and monopoly rules but even
data/011887.wav|at the time the whole trip that i got to be in a place like this by myself okay from from that moment on
data/026422.wav|it's sold way more subs than me and in fact
data/002579.wav|or six if you get this number i will give you one hundred dollars flat straight up there is no catch one hundred dollars flat if you don't get it i'm sorry we have to go to the next person you did fail the
data/028769.wav|the and so bad dude i wanted it in so bad dude
data/020908.wav|i stand for because it makes you do the wrong thing but i'm happy about it i made 12 grand today off of my neo stock
data/019783.wav|what the game was going to be like
data/005185.wav|but he did it and it was uh and
data/011287.wav|the new shows right yes or
data/008350.wav|it really a recession sounds awesome yeah
data/009230.wav|you know you could you could kind of
data/000624.wav|when i was in bed i think
data/003617.wav|i'll roll with my dad now
data/002672.wav|we have different preferences and different tastes but at the end of the day
data/007471.wav|i had my spork and i held it up and i said
data/010131.wav|yes i'm here i'm ready i'm wearing my
data/027144.wav|the running on credit and and debt and so uh
data/024178.wav|one or two and then quit they're they're coming for a lot more and not for
data/008281.wav|my dinner first babe look at this
data/006201.wav|it's like how do you just grab my ass
data/020923.wav|what the my passions league i need to be a pro player then the best i could have done probably
data/026595.wav|in a generation a marketer comes along that changes everything and no it's not
data/004440.wav|done right corporations think it's marvelous they feed us these ideas and then we
data/002564.wav|yeah that goes for him flip it damn i hate to see that i hate to see it
data/029626.wav|and i think got expanded in five
data/014633.wav|wait for them but right now they don't have it right now
data/018325.wav|everything because right now if you're a
data/026715.wav|of control so look at his smile look
data/001652.wav|i i thought my principles would have
data/022025.wav|it's just this is the worst part of
data/023353.wav|and this is likely a direct response to a great showing by
data/025370.wav|if i want to do this i it
data/030513.wav|spend the rest of your life
data/020863.wav|it probably doesn't even register in your brain this probably
data/028684.wav|so if you want to know how
data/023844.wav|the pain and just say your kid will be super lucky to have you as a dad and he said
data/023658.wav|of dollars in federal income taxes and actually received
data/014758.wav|he reached out to me i think we started talking and then
data/023090.wav|okay there have been many many studies
data/027137.wav|when they're low and borrowing money is easy then everyone starts borrowing money to do things like start businesses and hire employees and build factories and and so it juices your economy the problem is when interest rates are low you can't just stash your money in a bank and make money so you can see over the past you know 30 years the

data/012170.wav|so i get invited on my little data
data/011377.wav|what what could have compelled you toxic cloud
data/030802.wav|second of all why would i carpool with
data/011495.wav|in phoenix was good in it
data/017238.wav|it created wet january which is all about like binge drinking in january to start the new year off right
data/030217.wav|of the slide before me i dove down the slide and i tapped the ground after the slide before
data/008521.wav|and i didn't want to i didn't have to
data/028413.wav|i wasn't in the military no my father was and i grew up in on
data/023364.wav|to see if actually someone had mentioned
data/003154.wav|if the bank do you remember when the joker robs the mob's bank in
data/026337.wav|is the steve jobs quote you design a ritual of unpacking to make the product feel special packaging can be theater it can
data/003526.wav|i i i couldn't tell you
data/000943.wav|and wedding coming up real soon and this weekend is my bachelor party featuring
data/017627.wav|perhaps a poor online experience and and
data/032329.wav|by the way i've completed both i'm i
data/017049.wav|we don't include the shark tank stuff
data/020953.wav|and i make a good point and they go actually
data/015542.wav|mass cultural consciousness ted last of season one was the best they had but
data/025295.wav|which is a hodgepodge netflix is the one streamer out of all of these that has relatively low churn which is where some people in general consider netflix to be a bill something you have to pay it's not a choice people consider other streamers
data/027871.wav|and as it turns out when you can't borrow money
data/022658.wav|you should now have an extra
data/012741.wav|people don't like that so they get mad
data/012462.wav|that we're supposed to know but i have
data/001894.wav|when it comes from ads nothing zero i
data/021606.wav|it out of his child's mouth when he kisses him on it is working so i
data/030560.wav|it turns out i was not able to ask his wife i never
data/020536.wav|or game it has a very limited life cycle
data/015785.wav|dreamy services there's one that's called like
data/007861.wav|you're hoping for a good stream
data/027085.wav|simple as possible but i also understand that we need to open with a round of
data/028320.wav|pretty good at it he's practicing more than most people he's got connections that are pro players that are helping him out
data/007835.wav|for what i said it was funny
data/022829.wav|which i i believe to be correct that going forward the time
data/020118.wav|yeah to learn something uh this first
data/004223.wav|people that are like sad about this is zera so there's no
data/021472.wav|for another rise now again my recommendation as always is
data/011423.wav|let's say 40 months we'll call it even
data/004840.wav|and also within the three months he got you know
data/001380.wav|first letter of your first name and then i have to guess the full name it's it's a
data/011483.wav|the fact that that's a very unique situation you got a crazy story out of that most
data/028898.wav|and i'm i i've lost control
data/024277.wav|had to get laurence fishburne and the rights to his matrix character but let's go to number eight and see if it's any better this one is by jaguar we've actually watched this one if you're a die-hard
data/016549.wav|one hundred thousand percent since 2001.
data/026592.wav|is your more than they are
data/022602.wav|and that's how you dry off you don't
data/004115.wav|but the point is that she messaged me it was like in her first day
data/027248.wav|it on this receiving actually most of the
data/023404.wav|it's like what did he say i think
data/009826.wav|i mean it's positive trend we want to get more because right now if you look at the top car sales in america the top six are like gigantic trucks
data/024702.wav|i never having made a single car and most of that was from western investors people in america canada europe buying in thinking that this was a great idea china electric vehicles let's go they bought in it's worth nothing they
data/025551.wav|with the more they should just have the power they they have earned and be able to argue for things that
data/019197.wav|oh by the way uh can
data/015735.wav|i get a good example what's a show that people have done this before give me an example
data/019915.wav|if you weren't around for this ad you wouldn't know you wouldn't know
data/002436.wav|still pretty dope still pretty fun
data/024753.wav|impact is essentially a far more predatory casino it's the first truly triple a gotcha
data/022489.wav|have a little bit of fun you know you know it's all it's all it's all business all year for these
data/029373.wav|they start talking about this is
data/000848.wav|war of a bachelor monday i
data/027561.wav|worry financially impossible to even know what you had to spend and to get ready to buy
data/023922.wav|where everyone else trying to make it as a
data/010763.wav|it's really want them to give answers no well
data/002451.wav|a campaign you try to compare it against
data/015259.wav|if the king of the jungle the only weakness they have
data/014149.wav|if you start to blow up in that era you're not making any money you just
data/005610.wav|lied about it lied about it a bunch
data/026721.wav|one everyone else out of business become the dominant platform for for subscription games and then uh then
data/017594.wav|a cleaner store a better stand a better display all that stuff
data/002940.wav|if the and then you put them in situations
data/023730.wav|that has no danger of falling out it came with six little size things when i got it i picked the large one i put it in it fits snugly i can use it at the gym i can use it when taking work calls
data/028884.wav|so i want to impress her so i do all of the drinking and the second and again i remember nothing from the night since i i put that cup to my lips
data/030910.wav|i'm not picky that is crazy he could give a tesla as a wedding gift true could and should not
data/000998.wav|when a lawyer in a different um
data/015816.wav|it's got the impact in the reach they give him
data/005194.wav|but i happen to have this shirt in my
data/023693.wav|oh no why would you make it a poll why would you make it a poll bro
data/020767.wav|and i'm so excited that i won this award for the monday you know what it is what
data/024261.wav|it's very real this is what luxury looks like this is what it feels like
data/015344.wav|can't amazon just buy netflix no no shot
data/012339.wav|at the forks like they're just
data/014390.wav|which is genius that's very smart of
data/012615.wav|oh yeah on the way out
data/002726.wav|okay you're at what is this a hundred
data/015632.wav|the companies can and they don't have the creative power to beat
data/027662.wav|twitter blue or something so far the soft launch of twitter blue has been pretty underwhelming and not a big seller so it remains to be seen if that
data/020581.wav|if you bought it on pc you're already way better off
data/012923.wav|and by the way i knew in my heart then but i was kind of too young to explain it i can
data/015514.wav|but as far as i can tell from looking at
data/019327.wav|i original ladies enron 2 that's your boy and jason and
data/001930.wav|i want more free time i want like time with
data/012310.wav|custom drinks and everything they have is like they put like dry ice in a compartment at the bottom so it's like they're all bubbling they look
data/032196.wav|or minimum you either bet banker or player you bet yes or no and then they just deal two hands of cards
data/030905.wav|hey that it's kind of uh
data/025157.wav|but some wins this week i promise you we can
data/025890.wav|the a reactionary turf it's one of the jokes i think kind of summarizes in a
data/001157.wav|literally every day back to rules actually
data/023251.wav|it's can be skewed anyway this is penn
data/031718.wav|for these soldiers i want to see what they look like the
data/022270.wav|so they have time to build some sort of story
data/023709.wav|he's usually are real these i don't think it's like
data/014196.wav|this is a big cap because facebook
data/011564.wav|and a half hours long and i look at the runtime and i say no every single time i want to watch it i'm sure it's good apparently
data/008944.wav|or couldn't do it but to sign the agreement
data/004716.wav|i said do not be harsh with the cuts
data/017365.wav|it's the error as soon as the company became
data/027727.wav|living in this timeline the timeline where
data/025299.wav|yeah i'm done but you do do that for prime video for disney plus for apple tv for who you know that's that's more common of a behavior people are much more
data/020522.wav|the companies in the world is the brand this is a great quote that
data/017290.wav|i can get three free months of
data/015555.wav|they wanna hang out with celebrities they want to make shows everyone else is doing it they have the money it doesn't cost them anything
data/013295.wav|and no we just don't have room for you
data/016341.wav|in north korea for their country's first missile launch
data/015196.wav|and so netflix is doubling down the strategy of building and talent all over the world and the exporting great shows from and so netflix is doubling down on the strategy of building um talent all over
data/030476.wav|but something about that question is hard
data/026042.wav|hey above minimum wage they pay i think 15
data/005401.wav|and they were talking about some of the tips from that and he was like thinking about starting a new one with me and point crow and we could like share ideas
data/027611.wav|it might be both for some it might be both more
data/004190.wav|yeah of course i mean i i do
data/031830.wav|i tell you so what that means
data/027000.wav|i coordinate well with their tech team because having the website go down defeats a lot of the purpose but people
data/020930.wav|it's basically a little bit more market oriented it's that if you want to open up a trendy bar there's a lot of people that want to do that because it's cool so it's very competitive your margins which is the difference between what you what you bring
data/021498.wav|thirty three dollars or three hundred dollars and it's
data/026908.wav|kind of like it's like the was up ad back in
data/020060.wav|the billion dollars for the rights to baby shark
data/007762.wav|i forgot and i didn't notice
data/030715.wav|barbaric american education if you go to american school we spend at
data/017692.wav|or trying to find ways to not do it and instead apple
data/002427.wav|i charged so maybe they just didn't didn't work
data/002215.wav|the question they were like hey we're gonna
data/001066.wav|hey pop quiz totally unrelated question how much do you like when i give thumbs up what's your status on that like totally unrelated question i just want to know if that's a thing that is
data/018129.wav|if the computer and we can't move ahead
data/026985.wav|of for an ad and so i i i have to give it some credit i know
data/020742.wav|goes to an ad released in january before the pandemic facebook groups kazoo i present to you now facebook groups
data/021225.wav|peacock premium which is every episode of the office and peacock premium plus
data/002664.wav|is a cheerful and straightforward cat girl with a

data/027188.wav|back in time for a little bit back to 2009. now
data/023920.wav|and i think i have let's see i'm going through wins and fails
data/015433.wav|what else can compete with that
data/016044.wav|back in the day where we
data/027320.wav|this game so popular and so that's why i want
data/005823.wav|so mad i thought he was like a really
data/026589.wav|fuck with ninja turtle recording device and if she does it's a lot more invasive okay a
data/004114.wav|just the the gh in general
data/020650.wav|mcdonald's took their first word well
data/013684.wav|literally one of the worst ceos you
data/010350.wav|it shows up on game day and i'm like yeah we got the ghost we got the clown and we got me big a the team is goaded don't worry lyric and
data/029994.wav|well have a mix 20 000
data/009718.wav|i gotta get this off people uh
data/023486.wav|that's what they're going for get great deals on
data/003175.wav|most downloaded app of the year instagram previously previously held that spot for
data/010936.wav|i think we necessarily need to
data/023165.wav|at burger a near raw burger
data/000957.wav|no i am not streaming the bachelor party
data/017958.wav|or situation here good to see
data/028824.wav|what you live in a shitty apartment
data/007329.wav|was flicking people off was because some guy told me that
data/028446.wav|what's me in his office he buys me subway there was subway
data/030605.wav|why just just don't be wait ethiopia
data/010711.wav|what tax bracket dude i've never understood people that say that it's it's it's very dumb people that say i don't want to earn more money because then i'll
data/005764.wav|a good deal with but it was again i
data/026494.wav|reach an agreement with any of the rights holders involved in the creation
data/027536.wav|not a fan of elon musk and i'm not i think he's i think he's generally a clown that
data/029827.wav|let me cut you off right here ben you in
data/027504.wav|i can give you a quick breakdown on how we
data/017424.wav|i can their parents and they didn't want it to
data/005303.wav|but uh it was it was crazy i mean it was
data/000206.wav|i haven't seen him a little
data/028418.wav|just enlisted but by the time
data/014299.wav|and itself in this final stages of the war the major last ditch players who's going to come out on top and secure the majority market share add infinitum
data/001306.wav|is that once something becomes popular not only does
data/029116.wav|and so for a lot of that trip people were working
data/000009.wav|it was like six of us and we were all walking into a casino
data/021887.wav|because i can't imagine thinking you've won capitalism more than looking like this this guy's probably like in his
data/020310.wav|they screwed melee over so it's a one and we stand by that you think the kids parents should die i'm noticing a trend
data/016365.wav|are dollars that were supposed to rescue
data/021275.wav|three or four nuclear bombs i called of
data/008618.wav|so based on what i've seen from previous legal cases they have forced people to buy the company in this case before an example
data/031007.wav|i forgot what i got him it's probably a mug or something like world's best landlord or something
data/003697.wav|having a little bit i think apathy is one of the biggest
data/026810.wav|putting in dent in them but
data/029064.wav|what like i got no bruises on me he
data/005024.wav|and yeah then what i would do is make the i
data/011761.wav|my first thought is that's not what i
data/028796.wav|and that's when i crack at two times like
data/032119.wav|i'm not the worst player at this venue
data/028405.wav|and someone brings up a point like oh actually how did the
data/007618.wav|not even go live and the gifties
data/022789.wav|if the people money then you've also acquired their debt so you could lose more than what you paid so bank of america bought countrywide for
data/002241.wav|one gets posted on the reddit
data/017934.wav|the owners that are completely just leeching off the leagues you know
data/017166.wav|it's error and uh and that'll be that and then i
data/003407.wav|towards possibly doing something related to taiwan basically military action related
data/019317.wav|this kid was clearly from day one not going to do any work on this project the other kid was named jason he was you know sure
data/000544.wav|it was a really sweet moment and we all have these and we're
data/007163.wav|and i'm not immune to that right so saying one one area is right
data/025310.wav|the fail goes to blizzard that's not
data/002963.wav|everybody's talking about the gray man
data/025810.wav|lot of reasons that they have been diverged okay but the main theme i want to have is
data/010561.wav|came into my chat and said you know what i would love to do
data/024878.wav|two bucks but if they gave him the trinket and said it's yours how much
data/026355.wav|being perceived as luxury and high end and
data/012022.wav|the ship all get trained in lightsabers by a
data/000419.wav|shut up whose name was kyle i remember this
data/020965.wav|which one of these companies will be marked as
data/006394.wav|giving them the the fan resurgence they're hoping to get but maybe it'll make them a lot of money and they do need that as well
data/029344.wav|that was pretty cool and so
data/027005.wav|with the most memorable ads of the super bowl i
data/002478.wav|by even more chips and it was like they just
data/024449.wav|pretty regularly and most of them are so bad they're not even worth like
data/021022.wav|yeah i think it's funny and
data/018853.wav|bowl ad the point of this adds the
data/022225.wav|the my brother but there's no shot me my
data/007113.wav|two options you can watch this game of thrones clip compilation or you
data/027939.wav|and it's all included in the app
data/029345.wav|i have a good time we're all enjoying it we're
data/024319.wav|or in michigan and i think that makes sense i think the problem here is that this ad is very
data/011248.wav|i was really thinking about it for a minute but i
data/001950.wav|i would never do that without taking a
data/023037.wav|rulings and so i don't think that apple will lose now that being said
data/028528.wav|out twenty thousand dollars dude owed
data/006540.wav|what's been doing lately is like they're becoming more of a
data/023632.wav|that's what we needed that's what we needed thank god i was worried for all our all our allies
data/019843.wav|when it came out dude this game on release was probably
data/005466.wav|the clown ewing we had a good little conversation
data/002812.wav|the lifestyles or the fact that elon musk had sex with his wife but something happened in the past few months that have caused these two titans of industry to drift apart insane that while he was simultaneously impregnating a
data/019387.wav|as they they came in and had one quarter of success in traveler the very next
data/013714.wav|it'd be a dangerous precedent but i'm going
data/007516.wav|ask him right now wait where's my phone let
data/029797.wav|what everyone still had that respect and
data/018450.wav|what the games for windows i mean they
data/019941.wav|prior to the launch of the xbox
data/001080.wav|rattling so it's a tough it's like a real
data/019490.wav|what and while you're at it if you're feeling frisky talk one forever and with this
data/020916.wav|your passion is a bad idea and it's the best way to end
data/024179.wav|not for just the biggest sizes the only thing i think twitch really has that's unbeatable right now is prime if prime goes away or if youtube finds a counter
data/001174.wav|and it's very quick and there's no
data/008995.wav|but believe me i'm laughing so hard right now that i
data/006169.wav|was one guy there's this tall guy with an enron hat
data/030663.wav|to it and only one flowing out
data/010980.wav|to sort of experience it is you watch
data/005363.wav|he's not stopping so i start doing the thing where you're like like look
data/009099.wav|well the tell you about that i don't know
data/032004.wav|like literally like scar was like i'm going to order this pancakes and orange juice and his
data/005749.wav|a meter that's filling up at all times any moment that he doesn't have the
data/002557.wav|super lucky start you might be our
data/001048.wav|the bread and butter dota streams isn't it crazy how this stream was originally
data/008269.wav|the greatest like the first wave of like
data/013016.wav|it would just be in cohorts you'd have some group of people doing
data/025116.wav|with a devious company is it possible this is a reverse ad to make breastfeeding seem
data/008962.wav|yeah but you can read the agreement i would check it out uh they there is the the
data/028601.wav|and i got invited to a tournament called
data/018612.wav|are your refrigerator before it hits
data/015917.wav|what a lot of people in this past year they raised prices
data/006297.wav|i feel like i'm out of the loop act man was uh extremely nice to me
data/013574.wav|i must grapple work with a twenty two months
data/031056.wav|if some early ludwig stories you know i think that's what people want to hear they want to hear about the times before he was filthy stinking rich out of touch in a bubble um i i
data/029033.wav|in the parking lot kind of arguing and
data/002609.wav|what down even though i rigged all these from top to bottom it's still crazy that nobody's winning the stro you are our final
data/019301.wav|i messaged this guy who was a in my
data/024297.wav|and million dollars on this ad let's see what they got for it right off the bat it says you must be over 18 to views
data/016491.wav|almost everybody kind of averages out to around a middle level
data/030261.wav|my hair is lustrous and full my face
data/006076.wav|it's kind of i could still do
data/005843.wav|yeah it's a lot of money and he's like yeah people would do anything
data/021684.wav|and there's no flaws this is what this category was created for everyone in this commercial just needed
data/013008.wav|a way to make it where you're going deep on one thing at a time so you just you have to learn that before you can move on would be sick
data/028486.wav|we crying okay and he's like
data/015279.wav|anyway their current strategy is uh is
data/009883.wav|well i get paid in euros is like right now
data/003734.wav|but if we just consistently demand things over and over and say we're angry about things eventually something's
data/002392.wav|in eyes on it and have a good time and because you know if i had to wait till after work i'm not
data/010121.wav|was like a disaster waiting to happen pro tip don't get pepper sprayed
data/027230.wav|is almost skinner boxy and methods of getting humans addicted and humans love task completion but at some point it's refreshing and it's it's
data/020404.wav|the money secondly why is there like a romance

data/008716.wav|why a company he doesn't wanna run
data/023884.wav|every job a human could do
data/031059.wav|in the through the phone and i thought he was based on his voice and his jokes i thought he was really weird and i thought he
data/023943.wav|wrote state prison so the whole thing is just like
data/002780.wav|it'd be really tired but it'll be worth it because i think we want to do it before
data/029296.wav|i was like dude i love your stuff he worked on some back to the future game for
data/002157.wav|as there are cameras around squid game stages but in fall guys
data/005279.wav|that everyone around knows that they've never heard of
data/024150.wav|as they they're both gigantic and did not get a good renegotiation you know what i'm saying they're not getting a fat contract from
data/022484.wav|and if you're a skater you don't see that ad and be like
data/027398.wav|starting to realize how much roblox has gotten away with
data/023050.wav|is going to lose epic's going to bleed a bunch of money
data/026401.wav|this part of the clock has led to outsize
data/013819.wav|alpha and zoomers fights console wars
data/022927.wav|the console is winning hates cross-platform whatever console
data/026484.wav|we of harry potter where all the characters
data/006438.wav|but you're feeling optimistic in the distance you hear a faint blockchain
data/031970.wav|it's the next level by inviting slime's
data/022837.wav|the vietnam war and the iraq and afghanistan wars it's one of the biggest disasters that have occurred to our country i lost 80 percent of my worth

data/020474.wav|of tsushima or you play last of us
data/031692.wav|soldier soldier soldier king three soldiers one king
data/018420.wav|stadia by the way stadia spent an
data/018548.wav|i can't imagine a game with fewer
data/017605.wav|if the the company and in fact led them to their
data/022372.wav|and they had the confidence not to force in a can of red bull at any moment there was one by the computer that
data/001460.wav|what was the other guy from canada
data/008848.wav|because they don't want to be locked into that and then get proven wrong
data/029769.wav|what give trophies they don't give medals
data/010468.wav|but now they're not it's not cool like
data/016381.wav|small businesses at all basically took the money didn't save any jobs with it and uh pocketed it
data/018101.wav|oh come on this makes me hate pepsi more than anything in the world i cannot believe
data/007770.wav|then i wouldn't feel so embarrassed about it but i think i'll just put my pants on don't have to ask me twice
data/024106.wav|at that all auto brands are spending way too much on
data/007652.wav|yeah with a netflix logo for a face on a giant throne of like
data/021983.wav|i called him yesterday he has worked at an amazon
data/023425.wav|it's advice i can give most
data/015278.wav|are they're doing well they're they're big
data/021132.wav|then i then i think it's
data/019523.wav|the thing where would you put
data/020039.wav|this is the google pie okay this part is youtube this part is what's called google network and then this part in yellow is search advertising okay which is what doubleclick allowed them to do which became incredibly lucrative and also let them run ads on other
data/005435.wav|plenty lives happens talking to youtubers um
data/028743.wav|at one point had the most
data/022862.wav|what the career of pumping shitty internet
data/012774.wav|he would talk to me about making
data/030875.wav|the time i'm old you know what that's like
data/004639.wav|all right so he calls me he's like hey
data/010315.wav|jared leto imagine god if they were
data/000887.wav|in the middle uh jake you
data/030181.wav|it's like it's like this okay there was a bunch of these for um for all the
data/026857.wav|the seashell she's selling but they're not selling seashells listen i i almost shouldn't start this one because i consider this i'm
data/006480.wav|and it is down we gotta help him out boys
data/022445.wav|see themselves everyone in chat who's like
data/024247.wav|inria technology i would be moved i like seeing some of
data/003870.wav|i think there's a chance he gets primary i hope so i think if biden runs
data/028480.wav|this kid is about to cry my dad
data/030202.wav|it's a little squirt i'm gonna assume he didn't go whole hog but
data/001689.wav|wonder to get a free ticket he doesn't deserve he got out of bed and danced yeah after not doing any work around the house everyone needs him and he just sits in bed all day like he's bedridden but he's not he can dance
data/021369.wav|because people don't want to watch among us forever so
data/014092.wav|with drake and the world changed changed forever and all
data/000944.wav|people that are going actually because i didn't plan it
data/020410.wav|and they end up bonding at the end and they they have an oreo they split
data/022934.wav|working with playstation and we want this to be
data/007797.wav|where i take off a dream mask that's
data/002120.wav|well off the wall take it sounds like totally impossible but i think twenty twenty four we might see the biggest number of third party both we've well off the wall take and it sounds like totally impossible but i think 2024 we
data/028784.wav|that line i practiced it okay so she asked me the question comes and she goes
data/017043.wav|usually that's the whole day but then i just i also played games and
data/028479.wav|and they're having a pretty intense conversation
data/020336.wav|expected it was demanded things started off great we had our grand opening customer
data/019180.wav|and bought almost no games and so there was a general sense among the public that video games were stupid or bad quality or a
data/016424.wav|into to inflate away and then when all the money gets
data/017773.wav|read it and he's made a conscious choice again most
data/029733.wav|edit out him talking about how he
data/026909.wav|in the day i think it's clever i think it's me when people want to repeat it it's
data/030995.wav|i read an article that rent control
data/022970.wav|realistically epic games had two years where they made absolute infinity
data/015260.wav|if the growth starts to slow people eat
data/007328.wav|well the kids and uh the
data/003491.wav|you know i should probably try to find a way to
data/007726.wav|the of a few of us left
data/002481.wav|for parties what is that what does that mean squeak to that
data/030701.wav|but yeah that's my that's probably my educational peak lake bicycle the deepest lake in the
data/016081.wav|mckinley and they're trying to bring cable to online video which seems weird but it appears to be working and they make all of their commercials
data/014365.wav|the a foothold rather than just hardcore
data/016605.wav|in the past year between 18 and 30.
data/013586.wav|geez louise let's think more about the subs and less about these dark dark jokes
data/003971.wav|runs the military like i'm voting bald is really
data/015950.wav|watch netflix then you'll unsubscribe but if
data/016901.wav|exponentially the future of work looks way more decentralized many more people are going to be making money through online creation or talking about things
data/005450.wav|that is a deep dark blue
data/000277.wav|big enough crew and he's like yeah i'm coming with a crew they're all youtubers
data/019084.wav|well it's not human and you can
data/023542.wav|the reason for that is because it's artificially lowered it's not gonna last forever and
data/029757.wav|so everyone worldwide can hate leffen
data/008001.wav|would have supported me through this i literally don't i think she's actually
data/000022.wav|the trick is don't buy it
data/017794.wav|big banana for a while he's got a lot of these moments where you feel like you really want to be part of it so whenever you buy the sub you're suddenly
data/007783.wav|i have your social blade open on my windows startup at all times
data/028887.wav|i know about the rest of it is what i've been told
data/002526.wav|if you can walk away right now with 15
data/031607.wav|in the the computers and just play games for an entire
data/019584.wav|in one thing so not only do you know what they do they get you cash now but you know how to call them so like everything you need who they are what they do and how to contact them is in their jingle and the
data/026318.wav|we have revolutionized this part of the clock the purchase part of the clock previously when you buy electronics you would go to a place like best buy or perhaps a poor online experience first
data/001666.wav|a single video is factor related what what are you talking about yeah the first video
data/003923.wav|that's it doesn't make sense like it should never that should never ever happen except for jeb bush though hey
data/009667.wav|the one next lcs yeah next year
data/030527.wav|you didn't hear it from me i
data/031010.wav|he was a little bit a little bit nicer to talk to and so i thought we had a rapport going
data/000899.wav|it's be robert the with this your one anti war warhol but smell like a war that's
data/012132.wav|one and like i can tell her what's going on and we're like it was
data/008213.wav|if i want to get all political on you is that
data/007795.wav|that's actually not a bad idea for 500k
data/014521.wav|then miss kiev brought some real
data/017731.wav|as rewards um so overall in some you can
data/004253.wav|it has not been met with
data/001960.wav|we're not there and i'm not gonna see
data/002052.wav|in dangling cross earring and lives
data/008331.wav|it's like a little trick of the trade
data/022441.wav|and it was entirely from this green bubbles and blue bubbles
data/007030.wav|this so i played a couple
data/027764.wav|magnificent seven seven stocks that you could rely on for the future
data/018191.wav|i like this ad a lot because it solves a
data/021940.wav|what that means is you can go back okay so stop stressing so much about it a business example uses like
data/009161.wav|at that time at three hours so if it's
data/015349.wav|or freelancers whichever ones of you that
data/024575.wav|little bit of leeway with apple they got the new button the reason epic games
data/027777.wav|damn you love to see that from
data/029955.wav|i only went live to say why i
data/024396.wav|what a million dollars on your ad you could
data/029990.wav|we're right i mean you're not i'm
data/018523.wav|we make their own okay and sony knows this okay and
data/028329.wav|salty salty salty salty salty salty
data/024552.wav|it'll probably be a button or something that
data/030036.wav|wide people happy what does all boys even
data/012956.wav|you're losing the money you could have made and you're spending money and it's hard so like for grad school you really
data/026848.wav|of course comes from the hoster himself
data/024689.wav|what i'm trying to say is
data/006019.wav|and than anyone else and most you know like most
data/003513.wav|world there are many things that are going in the right direction
data/007254.wav|was wondering why the whole thing didn't go
data/024223.wav|if the are they worth it was
data/004169.wav|much like what does that mean
data/019984.wav|but what's crazy about marvel is how smart it was i think pixar was a very easy one to see i think you could see okay
data/022214.wav|yeah i mean in general a heartwarming ad
data/023054.wav|then someone in the eu or us are
data/029300.wav|and so he's like you know what come on in he brings me in he's like dude we
data/030350.wav|and i really liked her and uh finally
data/028092.wav|will fail at all it is what i call what's
data/024229.wav|by microsoft the most valuable company in the world called empowering what is technology what can it
data/005745.wav|i don't even want to say a nat dude he literally has to have attention on him at all times and and everyone at the table
data/028633.wav|if the college classes dude my work quite suffered but i started to see some improvement i started the
data/023077.wav|where everyone makes fun of on pcmr
data/030248.wav|hunched over and played league of
data/000235.wav|in your sad and whenever also sad you're sad and whenever else is sad
data/010801.wav|what what if it's a great movie dude
data/001169.wav|the highest spending customer but it was a
data/021333.wav|i don't think it's going away at all
data/011832.wav|i mean that was like gonna fit in
data/011482.wav|the movie but that's a movie
data/002364.wav|and hopefully you know some i was able to keep you down during the highs as well people always thank me for bringing them up during their lows but you know it's
data/014956.wav|own personal accounting which is great i think a lot of people and this is myself included um leave out a lot of things
data/023777.wav|and it's a minute long this better be
data/028442.wav|the from school but you gotta come with me to work because i i'm not done yet
data/027204.wav|is the era of the we a lot of games were doing the big open worlds maps
data/009661.wav|couple of things that can be improved but uh you
data/025700.wav|if the price about what it does about blu-ray
data/028842.wav|in one of these rooms they called the
data/001928.wav|the the thing i said was the only thing that scares me or worries me or makes me you know try to change things or find a
data/029302.wav|i help you out i wanna see
data/000147.wav|i thought my wedding invites were worth
data/014262.wav|i'm sorry i just had to call this out
data/014350.wav|big predictions that i'd like to drop here is that there is a very real possibility that a company comes along that is not twitch or youtube and makes it very easy to live stream almost like a
data/007381.wav|right top eight it was a really good sign for
data/014169.wav|when they brought over these two it started to realize that if you get not just one streamer but their group you can start to pull over the audience when you start to get
data/028650.wav|as inside they're like looking at me
data/020252.wav|you can use christmas trees number two a
data/005708.wav|it prop guns that they had
data/012202.wav|like there's bedding by round you can go all
data/013279.wav|i would i would watch that
data/013208.wav|don't think about you know like
data/007085.wav|what he wants to take it and i made
data/028728.wav|and while i'm doing this i've also been applying for jobs okay and one thing i was doing to apply for jobs is i went to the riot games linkedin and i joined some resume review contest where you submit your resume and you
data/006625.wav|if the ticket pulling the trigger and buying
data/021220.wav|and my predictions that peacock will be canceled this year though i think
data/024487.wav|to announce that both have lost it somehow managed to be a result that they both are unhappy with big win for everyone
data/013703.wav|you could make money off that if you weren't spending all your time working on square anyway let's hope let's hope it
data/003577.wav|let me understand what's going on so i can make a decision that is informed
data/008384.wav|just maybe a minimal version of that because twitter launched his lawsuit
data/026122.wav|we're back into the hands of the employees okay that was my last win i think it's time
data/027701.wav|information on your trades to hedge funds
data/019435.wav|and i was there and i remember they weren't that good back in the 15th century
data/022034.wav|several tweet i obviously think the tweet is obviously
data/015114.wav|from us and what he was saying was at the time was that
data/006271.wav|is your friend kobe reacted to it
data/005822.wav|he like he didn't he he hadn't thought about it at all he didn't care and he made a bunch of
data/015753.wav|or i could spend eight bucks subscribe to the streaming service watch it all and
data/011896.wav|like all right i'm gonna commit
data/013047.wav|smooshed down into the same box like
data/022901.wav|of their own the phrase it's such
data/025414.wav|this orc gets the drop on this gamer
data/028910.wav|and i was like yo we made it and then i'm
data/016666.wav|that like you know like when you're checking out at some stores and they'll have like the little white thing and you can swipe it it's a kind of a genius payments company that made it easy for the average mom and pop shop to take digital payments
data/031042.wav|is the condition we got it in he's like
data/026058.wav|this happen that's insane anyway so tech education for for toddlers is actually really important because alexa will try to test them and kill them if they're not ready
data/023583.wav|so you can do to grow whatever you're trying to do is raise this so i think i've covered it
data/009423.wav|dead wrong i think you have to understand that the newer a player is the difference between their best
data/006154.wav|i like what time was it
data/004719.wav|the last three drake albums honestly
data/028037.wav|of news about all of the tactics that these big corporations are now using to fight back extra hard against the unions
data/009855.wav|you know it's it's it's shocking and it's like if they could just not have that problem we could have incredibly
data/019075.wav|when you bring it into the
data/003883.wav|i think people are like i think they're they're they're
data/013863.wav|just buy it and forget about them
data/010973.wav|film would be more appropriate and that's true and that's wise and i'm sorry and you
data/027109.wav|the charlie munger at age 98
data/022587.wav|at your nearest swimming pool and
data/008381.wav|it's almost too good but i'm sure this one won't be
data/026437.wav|in the content but if your goal is subs then having a better purchase experience
data/000813.wav|so i have to i again i showed aria the
data/025023.wav|it because it's probably also you
data/030717.wav|that's about all we learned that year
data/004236.wav|and then i was like hey crypto yeah you
data/007207.wav|i did not ghost him or pass on him no
data/028400.wav|and i don't like you everyone knows it everyone on the reply all knows that if you say
data/021824.wav|we maintain a bald head and get the
data/022712.wav|now if you're wondering who these people are
data/030073.wav|was out i want you to buy it to me
data/015711.wav|thanks for supporting i do appreciate it
data/031925.wav|well of our friends and this is not like uh
data/028631.wav|if the meetings i'm sneaking off to the computer gaming area at twitch and playing league of legends games
data/011571.wav|is getting so big yeah he's
data/023008.wav|well never cut our deal for anyone
data/021569.wav|like to put it super simply it's like if you bet all on
data/026813.wav|it's a bad it's a dire situation and on top of that they sort of have seen this coming
data/028690.wav|which would get big in america and i always wanted to be part of it that's why i studied marketing in school that's why i studied abroad in korea my dad who's a
data/029916.wav|in you pulled out twitch on your phone to
data/025058.wav|could be nestle and i think primarily it's because globally they are major
data/031965.wav|while the ultimate kids were the ultimate kids were not laughing let me start by introducing our all-star lineup years of research starting with
data/017644.wav|a verizon store costs less than half a
data/022469.wav|about the thought process this is when
data/010185.wav|was title is actually not bad yeah okay
data/014574.wav|the go like you know like right now someone like
data/015320.wav|that doing better if you're in prime and
data/015266.wav|entirely different strategy let's talk about a company that really puts money at the first first and foremost
data/014874.wav|i do a lot of wins and fails right
data/018643.wav|in a monopolistic practices if they
data/013478.wav|although tommy in it was this age and he was rich
data/011490.wav|okay that's that we're gonna try a little bit
data/016529.wav|to kicked off the beginning of the modern esports era starcraft 2 was the first
data/023686.wav|and then quote okay next one okay well i'm just
data/030624.wav|i was in fourth grade brother i was in fourth grade okay it's funny because i think one of the reasons that
data/010235.wav|at the end of the day if he's pepper spraying
data/010959.wav|introducing the limited edition cheese blaster
data/029882.wav|it's i'm hanging out with scar i get i get like
data/024939.wav|add things i think about the gotcha
data/016939.wav|at the same functionality the same cleanliness uh i use it every morning
data/009218.wav|this game they're working on is going to have a ton of co-op modes a ton of like
data/018635.wav|if the service they'll use that for the cloud microsoft wanted to own all three and they flopped on mixer
data/013722.wav|i think money and making new accounts he had a
data/030824.wav|okay and your little talk doesn't get in my mind okay
data/015985.wav|what are you from office they don't care
data/021216.wav|i stuck with the mandalorian and all their
data/022353.wav|read on the back of the box and actually understand number two they have a variety of cool scents like grapefruit
data/020692.wav|were impressive and really earned them a lot of goodwill with the community and with sony management congratulations cd projekt red for your first monday award hopefully many more to come which are
data/029035.wav|little bit i guess ah you don't go back and i'm like whoa little bit like this you know i go back and i'm like oh what
data/014628.wav|the creator and you make a great video you can get a million views that is that is hard to do that is a quality
data/016343.wav|what are the glasses the slick back air
data/010571.wav|in the world i'm calling him chevron with
data/004777.wav|and again if they drop a certain amount
data/016515.wav|let's see if i can fix that
data/018355.wav|or you can do what i did
data/016219.wav|it's on amazon for two bucks
data/031467.wav|made that three thousand dollar stretch bro
data/022213.wav|immediately following this stream yeah i
data/021921.wav|it's easier and you make more money from each one
data/010046.wav|the golfing ranges you've had three wives you don't care about our lives well enough is enough
data/005379.wav|just one i got them with
data/016448.wav|in their disposable income as inflation continues to climb and gas prices go up that means more hours employees will need to work to maintain their current level of living we're no
data/017492.wav|if the for me this week was the success of the kellogg's strike
data/021829.wav|okay i just want that to be clear
data/025973.wav|we are hooked and they print money for blizzard for decades now
data/018926.wav|we will guarantee it someone did an interview with meg whitman and asked what she watches
data/008309.wav|i don't take too much time because
data/032089.wav|he had about enough to write the opening the first three or four jokes and then he ran out so he had to fill
data/024764.wav|okay adding up to billions so now let me get into some of the
data/023619.wav|these bars they sent me a care package a few months ago for the first go around and
data/021071.wav|i thought it would go funny condom commercial
data/008720.wav|with the twitter bot number is flawed but that it's
data/018676.wav|sony that's the only reason that
data/024286.wav|at least you can see where the money went that is not an ad you watch and go
data/021801.wav|it's not even a good depiction of both sides
data/023960.wav|we'll see all right so that's those
data/021074.wav|kids are always cute kids are always sweet kids are always heartwarming calling them annoying little sh is very
data/015025.wav|hold i repeat hold can you just hold would you
data/015695.wav|it now but first i'd like to do a quick question from our friends at lily bank
data/004889.wav|twitter is in a bad place because of this elon musk situation and has to fight tooth and nail to get this contract to be honored to the letter he has to
data/025038.wav|like they don't have cheese or something i'm not sure what it is but they make it different and it tastes way worse what is canada
data/025792.wav|but that's blizzard's week let's talk
data/016055.wav|take that other than that i don't really care
data/009835.wav|has not been close every single year the ford
data/006588.wav|but i think the funniest thing that i saw was this
data/018834.wav|at and his wife smiling at him and he looks at it and his
data/012060.wav|it was like the most pandering
data/030589.wav|i knew that this country has more
data/000048.wav|thank you for the three months
data/014145.wav|and if you happen to blow up in that era like if you happen to be let's say it's like late
data/025668.wav|the amygdala uh was grabbing deeper
data/023798.wav|because these are really funny and
data/005503.wav|and we have you know we have obviously a politically diverse family
data/006428.wav|that should keep your village safe for now you wish you could fast forward time
data/018923.wav|and then decided to go and work for
data/024059.wav|that are making an insane amount of money they'll find a way at the end of the day banks like money okay they may have to make a few
data/012509.wav|it's all time so i guess if you assume i didn't gamble
data/031016.wav|maybe he didn't do any of those things so i talked to him one day when we were talking about
data/027049.wav|if the lord of the rings this is before that that's
data/025263.wav|and then he became a mega star out of
data/009560.wav|but i wouldn't he's getting greedy
data/006074.wav|add of nowhere and took a stake
data/028476.wav|warm but my dad starts yelling at him
data/029975.wav|oh okay what's the marketing thing this week well i don't want to spoil it
data/005893.wav|asking everyone at the table to refer to
data/028615.wav|by the second year i was no longer ranked i hadn't played any solo queue and i'd gotten pretty rusty and somebody made a bet with me that i couldn't get diamond again because they added ranks like you couldn't get diamond you're trash now
data/031335.wav|big a deal you're all right like
data/014354.wav|i mean does it really well and integrates
data/005642.wav|new him and i was like it's just
data/018760.wav|flex factor design and it allows them i think to charge more uh whether you think
data/020448.wav|why offer a refund for the
data/023055.wav|we're going to be like hey apple's a little bit too big
data/013926.wav|that these companies use how they're
data/002807.wav|and you don't really know why
data/014434.wav|a lot of the climate right now is clumps
data/011978.wav|is either like you know larpers or families they want
data/027424.wav|because we can still own these brands on
data/022719.wav|and then they got a new ceo and now
data/029067.wav|and of course everyone always asks the
data/023832.wav|i have got the wins and fails portion
data/012223.wav|zero triangle pizot players know dude okay it's a zero
data/030306.wav|was that the best man at standards wedding i was the best man there without a doubt i looked around all the other males at
data/024640.wav|is there not going to pay it you guys know that
data/017824.wav|yeah this is it look at this
data/012390.wav|and i guess if you've been really crushing your tasks you
data/030223.wav|this this did happen as well the
data/026999.wav|if they did it made it stand out it stood out it was one of the most talked about ads it was one of the highest rated ads coinbase installs jumped to number two on the app store the night of so it was it was demonstrably successful i think it's a very good ad i think they did not
data/015870.wav|make more sense than paying for them all separately like making cable again no that won't make sense because no one
data/007020.wav|it's max w designs on twitter
data/027713.wav|was barbie i always thought it was Barbie I always thought it
data/027574.wav|there's conceding another part of it is that in the past week as elon musk has been talking about whether or not going to take over twitter there's conceding another part of it is this in the past week as elon musk has been
data/020937.wav|you can get rich quick this is this
data/011298.wav|the fire integrity of game files we're gonna try
data/024127.wav|anybody here hey i didn't see
data/019257.wav|this is like one of the first really big viral game memes giant enemy crab
data/008292.wav|well no i don't i don't want to do that you're asking me i'm already talking about going too far beyond and you're saying no you should make
data/023203.wav|your percent juice now a hundred percent
data/026466.wav|to use apple's 3 trillion evaluation
data/003560.wav|but i can understand my audience is
data/009179.wav|bothered by swings in live viewership mostly because i've noticed over
data/011799.wav|open the door and it's like right off the bat
data/022686.wav|so when she bought the company for
data/015516.wav|with celebrities okay let me give you an example
data/011783.wav|be immersive and right now everything was kind of gray and dreary and i'm like oh
data/009055.wav|doesn't that feel like that time flew by feels very recently feels very
data/031426.wav|we were cursing a lot and
data/015618.wav|more important the last mover advantage which is nothing that's nothing peacock is the latest to the party and has no advantage at all which means they're probably dead yeah this is this is dead dead in the water
data/009831.wav|but yeah maybe it's gas prices yeah yeah are gas prices caught up
data/023865.wav|me that big easy reach lighter
data/013996.wav|ship later how about that except i don't
data/020696.wav|and it's so terrible it showed
data/009051.wav|with the tier one published dragon thank you
data/032417.wav|you know it it just takes practice anyway i i want to show the end here
data/016801.wav|immerse and a lot of people that
data/016342.wav|music is part of it the music is part of it
data/003907.wav|people are saying that it might be mark
data/007572.wav|in a stupid australian voice he won't
data/025060.wav|and water access they bribe or otherwise coerced local governments into giving them access to water rights and then resell that same water back to the country at large markups they also do extremely degenerate things like
data/019938.wav|if the best acquisitions of all time i am
data/010977.wav|this is a film this is art
data/011820.wav|and they always always have were able to roll with it they never got thrown i was
data/008749.wav|in the board doesn't want to sell it to you the only way it works is if you offer a number so big they kind of have to take it or
data/001853.wav|and i have to go through his assistant everytime like he responds and i have to go through his assistant every time
data/012248.wav|i go take a stroll together we're walking
data/030344.wav|okay so write that down in your books peebo g
data/030982.wav|the the gear for soccer gods dude
data/016536.wav|you would have made three million dollars now dota 2 alone
data/002666.wav|in profile picture why why split the difference on that one you just take both parts of what where was the
data/027331.wav|it's actually added many many ways that make it kind of a lot easier to beat
data/024797.wav|or more direct for example in
data/000776.wav|it'd be fun that's like a pretty fun idea right i think that could be a really fun idea
data/005151.wav|in my life and i didn't know what it was like and i didn't see how much value this business would bring and
data/013049.wav|i did lesson plan that helps the bad teachers
data/021143.wav|if the find a way to stand out your your other
data/004434.wav|it's as a guest today and what do you think he would say
data/014717.wav|are you just a homeless person on the streets of wall street
data/011499.wav|that's the movie and like that
data/021286.wav|of duty it works for valor it
data/004438.wav|first of all the best type of marketing is marketing that doesn't feel like
data/026305.wav|i of the things as well as everybody you can't put all your money in everything
data/008315.wav|in the grow up every day that we're not technically in
data/017237.wav|it up you know to take a break from drinking
data/001909.wav|worry i've never thought of that i've
data/028032.wav|west corporate control they're not taking
data/028530.wav|but like all attack i call like
data/028840.wav|i remember i remember i was
data/011395.wav|our wars cocktail that you can get i didn't buy it okay i ordered it there's a difference okay i did i
data/023599.wav|this is a food bank now workers
data/013686.wav|don't know jack dorsey ceo of twitter was a
data/020796.wav|is the brand from a marketer's
data/018354.wav|always get to the phase where they're like right there where they they see you in the job
data/020095.wav|buying what would become pixar which is
data/011226.wav|it's ridiculous before i ever watch
data/027933.wav|and financially because they don't have a
data/019341.wav|i like napoleon but i said to jason and i said in our prospectus we're
data/021578.wav|for to you but you bought it
data/011629.wav|isn't a lot of things she's like a big fan of baseball she's a big fan of
data/010598.wav|it'd be like oh come on why can't you go live
data/011457.wav|i don't i don't do that that's not simple plan made a banger intro for
data/014009.wav|just a great conversation starter too i
data/016612.wav|if you want to check it out i think i have a pretty nuanced take on that i
data/010496.wav|if i'm being honest with you
data/026732.wav|with the great deals so pretty soon
data/007264.wav|and i gave him the hat and
data/013193.wav|uncomfortable simply lol w me when i see these
data/015927.wav|of views even like i don't
data/005582.wav|well the don't worry everyone's like
data/007974.wav|elusive target and i bet you guys
data/022334.wav|that's level one we turned it into sort of a viral thing so we had hundreds and hundreds of channels do it so seven days before the announcement of the
data/013390.wav|no chance to experience even though i've started to make more money in the past basically two years
data/012577.wav|that i found the account i never
data/008087.wav|if you would have done something before then this wouldn't have happened you know what i
data/015794.wav|disney has a problem with trying to keep all of its brands separate but still work together and so
data/015231.wav|this is global demand now if you go to america only this is actually way more even people have their own favorite shows and all these different services but if you zoom out to global level netflix has more demand than all of the rest of the other shows combined and
data/000587.wav|it's kind of see it here can you
data/016164.wav|second to last because then no one cares
data/018299.wav|in the book you're just standing around
data/027820.wav|and retail investors which is what you and i are average people not hedge funds or big
data/016250.wav|it's not put putting lebron's picture in an l final
data/026554.wav|how do you make this tweet and then five
data/004978.wav|a scroll back today through some
data/028255.wav|so you have to check references and even better i happen to know
data/022604.wav|playstation flow one serious piece of
data/017310.wav|for amazon um and what's interesting about this is
data/005671.wav|much higher than i thought they're they
data/015316.wav|if it makes money back all they care is that you stick around with prime prime is a bigger deal to them and what they're sort of doing is they're
data/012626.wav|as of sunday after the trip uh already
data/003623.wav|people that stigmatize living with your
data/013914.wav|a more in-depth one and this one i really think my audience today
data/002938.wav|right now but it's like uh
data/012334.wav|here's some of the food these were galactic grabbers
data/005766.wav|i guess quite smart i don't think
data/003108.wav|uniquely negative experiences or the fact that euro there's hundreds
data/018037.wav|was the man so comfortable with home invasion normally i wouldn't want
data/014517.wav|actually i got the wrong clip

data/004968.wav|the the horse hush payment disclosure
data/003214.wav|wage slave migrant workers in the philippines to play the game
data/028538.wav|i only hope and i don't know if that got through to

data/017099.wav|you know what i'm saying it's like a bad youtube
data/027838.wav|what the cash as the time goes
data/013963.wav|as a little bit but it's very uh hard

data/015569.wav|you can just put in the stream stick of
data/016229.wav|i have a big topic today
data/012253.wav|your some whispering of like oh there's like something happening in this room and whatever and and we're thinking oh that

data/025764.wav|that actually wins best scary ad of all
data/000211.wav|as that was funny i mean we did
data/009327.wav|no one really wants to carry around a ds and
data/025185.wav|his campaign to get some onion rings to pair nicely with your new logo let me know who i should help next okay so that you know it's a maybe it's not my cup of humor but
data/019623.wav|we talked about jingles the best part of waking up is marketing monday on your stream
data/017560.wav|but in fact the data does not bear that conclusion if you look at the data
data/026144.wav|instead of just banning him they
data/000334.wav|but i get a little too into it i get a little
data/020695.wav|what was this this won so many awards
data/028883.wav|and i was like she came to this party and i'm like i
data/028024.wav|for the past few months i've been given win
data/009901.wav|you a house and then told you all you have to
data/022876.wav|the court could not properly mute all
data/030904.wav|if the people i like wits and
data/019671.wav|wait so they've asked you to do these for like corporate meetings like that they oh that's awesome after you
data/014010.wav|i want you guys to know this is a great conversation starter you know just pick any one of these nicknames
data/023637.wav|i don't usually talk about this because
data/018783.wav|sony or microsoft you probably want to just get a
data/027139.wav|they basically dropped them to zero money is
data/026931.wav|and barbie found out about this dream house with an alert from rocket
data/029253.wav|i thought it was super sick this was when destiny and his followers began their second attack turning what should have been a simple use of the pc into a nine hour
data/029486.wav|and so i always thank that guy he he
data/016693.wav|the the great app for commuting is
data/020088.wav|doing because he's a kid it starts doing
data/030680.wav|and then my dad's like not well not like like really bad
data/029553.wav|i picked the right people they were like this is good yeah it felt like they were
data/007717.wav|and like they had mariachis playing and everyone was
data/022379.wav|it though it's probably less scary this
data/015410.wav|with the families would have to do and they'd
data/012386.wav|i remember i was in line for food next to a kid and i i like glanced at his data pad and he was like messaging
data/030455.wav|is i mean it was i mean it
data/029741.wav|i saw him at one point throw a cup of ice at children i thought he was a real mean guy because this day i have no idea
data/015369.wav|of how much these three services spent per emmy okay
data/016221.wav|what does that mean uh stalls
data/029088.wav|twitch cop capital t capital c and it was me in a cop hat with like a twitch logo on it and like
data/029228.wav|see this curtain and there was like a curtain that led out to the main area
data/031867.wav|outside of that one boston major with
data/030869.wav|it is grind to gold day
data/005343.wav|sitting down everyone's filing in getting to
data/012974.wav|his failings for their kids feelings but
data/006022.wav|you know that's already an advantage even if he was less good but if he's actually
data/016324.wav|around st patrick's day and it actually worked sales did quite well and then unfortunately the guy playing him went to philly in the costume and said that he supported the ira and that british soldiers were better dead than alive

data/017579.wav|wide around this they did not care about this or this it really relied on create a sticky compelling advertisement and then the rest

data/011840.wav|in the windows are big and and it's like i'm walking around
data/032151.wav|a squad and everyone's rolling having to get time i roll a squad and everyone's rolling having a good time
data/020651.wav|well but now it's time for our second award read of course by yours truly it's time

data/006936.wav|yes yes yes yes indeed yes okay right
data/008062.wav|i can definitely talk to you who that but i have a sneaky feeling it's not really important i have a sneaky feeling that you are abusing i can definitely talk to you who that but i have a sneaking feeling it's not really important
data/000688.wav|i think it's cool we're like this this is
data/020752.wav|a job because of facebook and the kazoo then this house which represents the very foundations of america starts to crack under the pressure of all this misinformation
data/020947.wav|you got 12 likes and people don't
data/009478.wav|escapes dude he's going to die every time
data/002597.wav|i would love to hear your role heads or tails
data/023339.wav|disc golf celebrity and it's because there's a there's a a passionate group of fans that love disc golf
data/032188.wav|it was great okay and uh saturday night i take a good chunk of
data/029233.wav|nope just stay back here and then when he's out there
data/006066.wav|part of your brain gets to really activate we're talking about the
data/010277.wav|what a cute cats there's no getting around it there's no getting around what a cute cat there's no getting around it there's no
data/017441.wav|okay the reason i didn't drink or do drugs um was because i didn't get invited
data/021616.wav|was the highest in recorded history nearly 6 million
data/003468.wav|and i will think about it more for next week i only got the feedback that we need to be a little more positive this week and it was too late so i
data/012787.wav|like yeah man even if we like start
data/002379.wav|i might make a small bet in that direction paranoid
data/019209.wav|by the way the code name for the Wii was
data/022197.wav|if a run to the edge and they wrote it to the edge and they
data/009272.wav|that would be conflating my real job and my streaming in a way that i don't want to do you understand that
data/026070.wav|and took in more than i think like the next two combined at this pace can hopefully have a future where every single movie we watch all year is a marvel movie with your help we can make it happen i want to see a
data/019755.wav|is on our shores we are little over a week away
data/014037.wav|very different group knows ludwig they like ludwig they don't always collab with him
data/011940.wav|are patrolling and like it's like a takeover
data/016981.wav|i got a book i just finished that other book about the depression it was pretty
data/003231.wav|and everything they've said for the past
data/023726.wav|i who provided me with these earbuds
data/029809.wav|go to tournaments not practice and he will just get yes
data/008644.wav|this is pretty solid and the delaware contracts
data/012157.wav|we did that was evil was like goofy
data/005904.wav|at the time dinner had lapsed
data/030279.wav|playing league and you know the second he realizes
data/001138.wav|it's really funny like is this is
data/014071.wav|complete with sorry i need to find this real quick
data/024010.wav|your membership quack salary i take it out of the paypal and i just i
data/018387.wav|i don't make any money because like piracy like
data/019117.wav|is available followed in two days by the
data/026521.wav|out of character but again i i don't know exactly what this project entails i didn't bother to look into it i just know that it's from a marketing standpoint a bad because your target audience is people
data/003189.wav|well the employees and basically said um
data/025031.wav|in atlanta when i was trying to steal the orange julius wi-fi in that mall
data/031711.wav|you lovely lads and lasses in the chat he's got some pull these days so i get
data/010790.wav|you know it's like it's a dangerous new drug and you need to test it and the only person you can trust is yourself
data/000792.wav|i want to pay for one
data/018571.wav|out of the gate and so
data/029585.wav|if you remember the last time we did a reads episode in person
data/011139.wav|i would say nice things without saying nice things dude i was saying
data/015098.wav|or crisis so much like in
data/020640.wav|because we're close personal friends but still no i'm
data/006868.wav|to twitch and that was my twitch halloween costume which is
data/009188.wav|pretty cool especially as a side gig it's uh
data/024271.wav|the kia you know what i'm saying it's like
data/011736.wav|you're taking a cruise into space so the first thing i
data/026560.wav|him he's just trying to buy
data/006389.wav|your grandfather didn't give his life just so his grandson could pay money to
data/030781.wav|sorry to leak it now but i'm fired up today yes i wrote everything it's my most
data/020553.wav|in the company but i wouldn't until they've proven they can solve these problems without killing
data/032015.wav|and then you could just see
data/020654.wav|by right but we were actually this is not a joke told that we legally could not there was one more great performance this year one that truly floored me truly stunned me and if
data/001938.wav|no the balance is really fun you know what i'm saying i like i like the balance i think the
data/022817.wav|this much money it was kind of worth what it
data/017955.wav|so yeah again focusing on these two areas has been just a big big increase in value for a lot of companies and people still don't understand it people still think it's this area which is marketing
data/000815.wav|there but like i didn't get the either i got
data/017330.wav|pay above minimum wage they pay i think 15
data/001277.wav|i got sponsored by fear factor know it's always been a dream it is funny that when i was i got sponsored by fear factor i know it's always been a dream
data/002530.wav|dollars if you roll again heads or tails
data/022781.wav|now you could be forgiven for not knowing countrywide banking and home
data/012513.wav|the smallest room so technically we could have added
data/031431.wav|was almost lost to the sea like
data/008037.wav|and they are all big it is it is it is like
data/004472.wav|what i'll do is they'll ask me if i
data/005262.wav|turning the attention of both groups on to me and i already said hey what's up man you know i was like hey
data/018656.wav|today is marketing monday if you guys don't know my full-time job for the past four years now for three years has been global
data/026621.wav|and i was exaggerating this is not the case this is not an exaggeration the reason i didn't think this was possible i
data/011735.wav|that they will never ever break character and everything is designed to make you think
data/016300.wav|was just coming out of cdpr i i trust him through
data/016541.wav|i think the worst job to be unless you're absolutely generationally great
data/025829.wav|after the launch of queen's gambit that's the red line and
data/000710.wav|anyway i've known him for a long time i
data/007189.wav|fly every weekend for twitch and i would
data/007086.wav|but that was just to be a dick all right
data/018786.wav|and i'm very excited to see what happens
data/031535.wav|you can't just walk straight over and flash had studied this map so much that he had a brilliant strategy instead of like taking this space in this
data/027140.wav|is essentially free to borrow so right about now is when
data/015570.wav|of roku and you can watch netflix or anything you want and also roque has
data/022597.wav|as quickly as possible we've developed an incredible new way to draw yourself it's a massive leap
data/022730.wav|only two years after owning the company that had lasted forever they fired
data/028017.wav|or role in inflation and for suggesting that the wealthiest individuals on earth should pay more taxes he really didn't like that part it's pretty well established that raising taxes especially
data/029658.wav|good combos very modern kind of fox but
data/022230.wav|no i don't want any johnny walker it's
data/027794.wav|well the inflation video there's two outcomes and
data/026864.wav|the q score or whatever hers is probably literally off the charts so
data/007825.wav|every single person in the chat to look
data/013235.wav|i just wish they would do it
data/006762.wav|that she sent me during game seven of the
data/024327.wav|let's get to the big ones
data/011060.wav|wait it out with my life
data/009873.wav|much harder i could get from like london to i
data/008590.wav|i want to get paid that much money for my
data/026892.wav|wait they really did well you're
data/017826.wav|for all companies but nvidia drivers are generally better generally easier to use and
data/011917.wav|what i'm talking about so right in the first meals when you realize
data/019830.wav|the developers just got caught in a sort of terrible web of lies and their response to
data/021718.wav|but i can tell you from a marketing
data/001318.wav|money that there's like there's like a
data/011912.wav|it's the third and final is probably the final major plus
data/007125.wav|the the get it so i i wore mine but i can understand if
data/017368.wav|the robots can lie you know that is
data/009022.wav|let's see what i did july 12th of last
data/000513.wav|i'm fine thank god for that blt it gave me
data/013409.wav|they should have called chris chris would have done a better job
data/016032.wav|it's worth the money it's and it's sick of them to sponsor marketing monday and i it's worth of money it's um
data/026345.wav|i a regret that accomplishes things that perhaps spending the extra money on advertising and having a worse packaging might not here's a great example that they have this is an internal leaked
data/021695.wav|but we can give you a free t-shirt
data/014117.wav|the big creator in these years now that's a
data/023213.wav|if you haven't seen it is absolutely fire free range doesn't mean anything
data/023313.wav|with a massive fall today but i i took a screenshot that i really really liked that really just made me think of someone
data/004403.wav|triumvirate you know financially we're both deeply involved
data/016403.wav|at prices the higher medical care prices the rapid inflation of everything you'd like to buy or
data/020179.wav|is that really such a crime is that i
data/004633.wav|we manage your wealth and uh
data/016538.wav|actually i think it's billion one billion dollars
data/014074.wav|the that amazon execs calling me like what
data/027902.wav|finding a great deal it's hard with how
data/027247.wav|and examples of some of the ways ubisoft has been uh you know sort of
data/005913.wav|they knew their numbers yeah that's it jarvis was great
data/010804.wav|you have to slog through the first one because the second one is actually
data/026739.wav|yo games and so as microsoft thinks about the future of the metaverse essentially they just want to build large connected gaming worlds and then the fifth reason final reason is mobile and it's also kind of part of their metaverse plan but they
data/020280.wav|is really clever i think giving it a four
data/001176.wav|if you like to cook i don't recommend it if um if you don't
data/032224.wav|it would be so i take every chip i have
data/026497.wav|they spent the money on the book to inspire them to begin this wow good start another amazing crypto project in the books it's crazy to me that despite crypto being a thing for a couple
data/012378.wav|the a bartender but he was not into it at all
data/024284.wav|like it i think that's a good ad uh
data/023300.wav|but coke's response which was yeah
data/004416.wav|i think it's been beaten by one by now
data/001642.wav|like most cheating times aren't one
data/011805.wav|at like and all of the windows were really high def screens so you look outside and it was like
data/018473.wav|the games and their price and we said damn this
data/000093.wav|it's react meta is my full uploaded vod of my
data/020059.wav|you're telling me you wouldn't pay
data/008579.wav|it gives you a beater car it's like a it's a fine car it runs but
data/027351.wav|about what what things are are core and
data/026454.wav|it doesn't become part of the mango nation he
data/024158.wav|if the bag like ninja as a content creator
data/006448.wav|where every one of my friends and family
data/025938.wav|as of aspect of it that much so they're making
data/018529.wav|okay it'll be either timed exclusive
data/004896.wav|the company and then the board of
data/014949.wav|it makes it a lot easier to track things that accounts normally take care of for example i don't have an accountant i used tax ninja that one time
data/012726.wav|the school runescape but just runescape
data/021351.wav|high point now i had no idea
data/006327.wav|that doesn't seem like a good idea it doesn't seem like a smart that seems like i'm throwing myself to get involved in a bad way that doesn't help anyone and makes it worse for me two wrongs
data/000766.wav|the strippers and instead of you know
data/021959.wav|eventually no one else can do what you can do i think the way to think about
data/015638.wav|there are only guy i i think their entire market is
data/017904.wav|i just are selling because they fit into the apple ecosystem and you can
data/008829.wav|with the past eight nine months
data/017270.wav|it's all it's all available or it's all available and it's all kosher because winnie the pooh is now public domain that being said it's actually not all available it's all it's all available okay it's all available and it's all kosher because
data/001679.wav|the poor all right we're gonna watch it
data/003766.wav|few politicians championed and they were
data/018878.wav|cool was this all the scenes they showed at
data/021152.wav|be safe around trains a message from
data/007262.wav|right after grand finals is over and he lost he goes out he smiles
data/012178.wav|or come and gone and the fourth
data/032370.wav|it over and over and over and over and over
data/016935.wav|his sponsor and a long time marketing monday sponsor
data/013303.wav|do i know you in a business or professional context and then when you have the answer to
data/015961.wav|because xbox game pass for pc sounded stupid but you know
data/004927.wav|i like they they closed the door one of the agreements of the deal that
data/018859.wav|many reasons but the fact that he had to go to a vocal booth and say
data/025918.wav|in the speech about it they
data/014862.wav|i dunno what they call it down there but
data/009845.wav|or been to chicago to be honest as much as i've been around because the military family thing
data/025715.wav|giving your competitor a ton of attention so you get a crumb you're spending your money to give them more attention scary ad bad one let's do
data/023898.wav|last game last stock even percent
data/012523.wav|the eight hours or whatever more than that but but if you're not all in and i think i was i tried to be as
data/025517.wav|through the roof they're actually producing quite a few they're just all getting sold
data/015995.wav|well it's a pretty good command in
data/027548.wav|is takeover what percent of the companies
data/015329.wav|game of thrones final season on
data/029398.wav|be guy who brought me here and ask him
data/012812.wav|the really grind for the college team instead of my quote unquote pro team and then our college team won ivy law
data/031753.wav|where you've told me there's a class
data/026284.wav|purchase this happens while you're buying the item and this
data/003271.wav|so let me get you an actual
data/007743.wav|until they were forced to cover your bill
data/026447.wav|if any other email people want to be
data/006165.wav|glad i wore the enron rush to mogul
data/018002.wav|that solves some problems but creates
data/024713.wav|well with others without this without this outcry
data/020430.wav|because you might have a chance to win cash
data/015312.wav|to sell more toilet paper because that's the strategy here the thing that makes amazon unique among all
data/006357.wav|the and ten thousand dollars plus and you know what's great about it is that the first ten thousand dollars i mean i i sort of looked at the thread on reddit that that
data/012493.wav|around you your choice to experience
data/008733.wav|small amount it needs to be really significant and
data/003774.wav|the but i would say some things if i saw joe
data/025661.wav|of squid coin was able to sell it was literally locked out of selling for everyone else you could only buy so everyone bought squid coin he sold it all at once when it hit two thousand
data/027115.wav|it's one of the biggest causes of a societal unrest because any savings that the
data/029356.wav|well that was the only thing i would
data/026915.wav|if be the one one of
data/007682.wav|they just won't move off the shelves
data/015294.wav|eight and a half billion dollars just
data/012195.wav|i was like babe can you please leave that very
data/026292.wav|the very good at this section of the clock but other companies have attacked different areas to
data/008418.wav|if the that we'll see how that goes
data/027861.wav|to the moon to the moon
data/031638.wav|the rest of the night i distinctly remember i saved moon's evening that that was like the most interaction
data/002789.wav|he has chemistry with himself anyway he blew up the song
data/015775.wav|sports is finally not holding them up for a while sports was the only thing
data/030991.wav|at the triple and uh he was kind of intimidating
data/021947.wav|i was supposed to present the deck on my strategy for something i think it was promoting
data/015495.wav|it's worth exactly the same as them
data/011511.wav|right fine check that box then i said
data/026301.wav|i want to talk about the ones that apple is focused on apple has completely
data/031792.wav|this group used to be way farther away and now aiden ross has come in this was
data/018520.wav|things like that that's where netflix
data/008534.wav|tyson foods is one of the biggest food conglomerates in the world and back in the early
data/010998.wav|right about meow i think that's my plan i'm
data/028803.wav|i thought this is a huge exaggeration i
data/006021.wav|is actually good at the game if
data/020040.wav|it became like this foundational network that every site plugs into and now people can buy ads for any site it's
data/020074.wav|facebook bought instagram for a billion
data/018826.wav|it's a safe target right because even
data/014979.wav|all different weaknesses they have different strengths and it's hard to determine from the outside who's going
data/004994.wav|the second option is that they
data/031626.wav|is at the end of the night for whatever reason i ended up in a hotel room with like six other um like press
data/025621.wav|i wasted it isn't this every kid's dream
data/002604.wav|god damn it roll it newbie guy heads or tails and we're getting near the end of this segment actually we're actually a little over
data/008880.wav|and it would probably be before the deal goes through
data/001721.wav|worship have i told the story there is a cruise ship here have i told this story
data/011950.wav|rate of him and i'm not i'm not gonna
data/028849.wav|in my back so i walk around the office and i just steal soft things from people's desks like for
data/030416.wav|i had a photographer playing for td but i
data/002724.wav|with the wedding because of this i want you to know that one
data/029618.wav|one perspective and i feel like that's another one of those things with
data/023948.wav|i have one more l you know how
data/031246.wav|earlier today in between the games we had gone to a mall in atlanta and there was free wi-fi in the food court
data/028063.wav|cause i wanted to give a fun piece of honor for it and also
data/005017.wav|i like this what if we all pigeon you guys with subscribers and i like this what if we all pitch in
data/023990.wav|the money they are not you have to be so stupid
data/008637.wav|that's no that's the argument if they fight with elon if they side with elon it's a really really really bad precedent which is why i think it's very unlikely the delaware court which has always been a pretty
data/003842.wav|someone like the rock for example is liked by republicans and democrats alike the values
data/025845.wav|to make some money a blizzard cinematic was better than the world of warcraft movie and maybe blizzard a company that could have done this that had years of excellent
data/006084.wav|wait a minute you thought the clip was
data/026567.wav|if you want i thought marketing money was
data/012834.wav|in the company got bought out by zif davis
data/008156.wav|well we could do a surprise guest appearance
data/000188.wav|you thought you thought i met mike tyson
data/006258.wav|crazy different ways ends the balloon menace once and for all
data/014248.wav|big apex player or a shroud someone who's like got a core audience and is very skillful but it's confined letting them go again twitch's strategy is is kind of
data/000553.wav|isn't even the best man like you just did it for the
data/024824.wav|a huge discount on something you know basically what
data/032392.wav|i don't want to make a youtube video about this
data/017746.wav|if you feel better about your purchase after
data/002799.wav|why is the mic so broke i don't know man
data/020000.wav|pick up a football and watch
data/002777.wav|the actual ways to play it figure out some of the cool you know
data/005762.wav|shrimp persona that is him off-stream
data/018408.wav|is this ad sucks it's only slightly better than
data/000534.wav|the grand seiko four seasons this last time we were in vegas we were all drunk and we were last time we were doing well we were like here's our plan we're going to run it up at the casino
data/026056.wav|plug in a phone charger about halfway into a wall outlet then touch a penny to the exposed prongs amazon said it
data/027895.wav|in longer term what if we take over canada
data/024983.wav|that society is amazon only hated in one country that's germany that's actually
data/002497.wav|it's not a great game just didn't did a lot of things kind of badly but
data/022558.wav|a language works best when you practice every day
data/003742.wav|right let's say you work at at
data/025396.wav|i got a tweet from slime what did
data/013360.wav|that's just i mean that's nightly news
data/001977.wav|good yeah you could market it well it'd be fun it'd be a fun challenge you could
data/014458.wav|literally logging in to nvidia vpn
data/010488.wav|and i forgot how great the chicken fingers episode of season one is and if you haven't seen community i think you are not allowed to say you don't like it until you've gotten to that episode
data/027271.wav|it's kind of thing for summertime they
data/012268.wav|kind of annoying at some points he
data/030562.wav|so eventually he had to tell her eventually like whenever they were alone he brought it up and assumed she'd already been told that she had not
data/026923.wav|i think it's pretty mid but i also know that it was more memorable than the average bear
data/027938.wav|i mean it's easy to use it's got a great interface it has easy access information
data/028069.wav|anytime you want any place you are it's like a walkman
data/007608.wav|and that was the cool part that was the coolest part about
data/011589.wav|it's stupid says something similar i can no longer hold that opinion the internet ruins opinions for me because i'm like i know that you're
data/027212.wav|it actually was a massive success dark souls 2 even better dark souls
data/027265.wav|i want to get into that with brand image so this is a research done on tesla and it was why tesla who had some serious quality control issues they were releasing cars
data/016334.wav|do you guys were gonna say it and we all said it together in solidarity kim
data/006922.wav|one reason i was wearing this nice shirt and i was like
data/002625.wav|try it backwards okay okay i'm gonna allow it but everything you've already said
data/012134.wav|at different side because then i could see we could share stuff back and forth and
data/012764.wav|like you understand you're part of the
data/000475.wav|so i sit back up and i'm like i need
data/016282.wav|where the game came out they started mandating a
data/001107.wav|i heard anyway whatever you're into
data/001855.wav|yeah but it's always like dude so excited my
data/013974.wav|i i want to make that clear because i've seen a lot of these companies start to blow up i've been watching their financials explode and if they're making that much money and they are getting invested that much that means
data/025280.wav|with the game max off the charts domination and and it's global
data/029900.wav|three corner and we're like calling an uber to
data/011301.wav|to do that that's what i was having
data/025145.wav|very expensive so let's see what this six second ad is that they spent so much money on to get
data/007658.wav|i can promise this hand of god
data/031929.wav|we're making out and everyone's kind of like i mean i didn't notice the time i didn't know
data/026399.wav|that people don't think of as much but they have a much bigger impact than spending extra money on tv advertisements these things have done more to market the
data/031585.wav|it was crazy you never see
data/017819.wav|in marketing monday on the clock model please
data/021555.wav|right now if you're thinking oh man this was great
data/025985.wav|well marketing i'm talking of course about pabst blue ribbon which tweeted this morning not drinking this january try eating what's funny is this guy was completely off book off script he was fired people asked i
data/022969.wav|and the fortnight money's going down
data/000222.wav|it's arrive and i have a sip and it's the
data/014098.wav|let me go full screen i don't leak like a youtube contract or evacuate the and that is let me go full screen so i don't leak like a youtube contract
data/018112.wav|good i can't how can i say
data/026030.wav|in america works for amazon that's just a new piece of information that hit me
data/002786.wav|and i'll be right back brb
data/024245.wav|way with the with the intended effect was it
data/001361.wav|he would play game let's play a game let's play a game
data/000161.wav|on a roof and we just look at the city and we're like we
data/010940.wav|meals which are quite delicious today i'll be showing you this one this is the
data/006162.wav|the only thing is oh well whenever i
data/030356.wav|so i planned this vacation and as you guys know i had this vacation
data/024619.wav|in this space more to find a new way to grow revenue and that is digital goods so they're crossing over with the biggest
data/022698.wav|if the companies that spend a lot of money on
data/027009.wav|which means i am not in the target market because i thought it was terrible so i'm
data/023045.wav|at the the antitrust of the government ruled that microsoft was over the
data/003636.wav|and they are dying like you know like
data/026787.wav|if sort of come to dominate our entire economy apple amazon facebook and google facebook now meta those companies and you could say microsoft as well actually between those five companies they basically have no industry
data/012219.wav|so i'm facing off people are watching i
data/003185.wav|in the gutter and employees are leaving
data/009407.wav|let's see what they go for i'm honestly expecting
data/016606.wav|but this is a serious problem and it is leading to a lot of negative societal outcomes and finding ways to
data/029786.wav|you know one of the cool things for me getting into the scene around
data/017776.wav|but if your goal is subs then having a
data/003730.wav|yeah but it's not impossible to make pro to make
data/015004.wav|it's all standard american adults are actually
data/018090.wav|oh my god they included that they included that in their game
data/008276.wav|watch some of the greatest um
data/026681.wav|their money to the league but all of
data/008748.wav|like if you're trying to buy a company and
data/005071.wav|values and judgment for normal people
data/015110.wav|one of the best business quotes i think i've ever heard to me i think
data/031080.wav|we didn't i i knew from working there and so i knew that ludwig was going to
data/007210.wav|as the truth of it so we get to genesis and i
data/031909.wav|i took uh cleopatra okay so we rented a lemo
data/028096.wav|in value because everyone was scared that it was jack ma the ceo
data/008045.wav|what how does he do it and that was the humor and it was that over and over again for the entire game every combat of which there's thousands that was that was literally it and then i'm sorry wait the
data/014075.wav|what are you doing we're customer focused
data/021024.wav|what's coming out this would remind you it
data/011906.wav|and some people were like we're like me
data/013893.wav|you didn't get dune i got dune there's
data/031319.wav|if the back room stay here sir we're calling the police wait what what no one's
data/002112.wav|i heard of that they try to i think i think they want god
data/001662.wav|well yeah i want to know that
data/025646.wav|who do i root for so yeah i
data/000686.wav|and they get drinks and the drinks are awesome the drinks are really sick there's like a socky cloud like it's
data/008505.wav|it doesn't want to do it
data/022155.wav|add by google and with this ad by google and with this ad by google
data/017423.wav|and drinking have a ruinous impact on their parents
data/031110.wav|he's been hustling he got better and
data/031524.wav|i got this at this event i was in the i was in the crowd waving this i was like
data/017406.wav|this isn't like a joke they just think that's me
data/008651.wav|oh big nobody's ever done a deal quite this big and just said nah not paying like that's basically what
data/012642.wav|yeah if you want to get medication
data/006917.wav|immediate damage to my my life i honestly believe that i think it's easier to be a functioning alcoholic
data/018773.wav|funny because they had nothing they clearly had nothing but they needed something for their show
data/022747.wav|we're making were so ugly and poorly constructed that while they still owned motorola
data/017163.wav|mount we could sell and so uh
data/021716.wav|now here's the hellman's magic creamy dreamy amy schumer is not i i have no particular
data/011065.wav|i can't i can't find sphinx
data/028566.wav|i had already paid taxes on it
data/023519.wav|once they get this number up they do not raise price and if you have a big
data/015527.wav|their idea is similar to amazon the apple ecosystem if you're part of the apple ecosystem let's say you're
data/032284.wav|here we go all on red baby here we go
data/030602.wav|not bad at all i was
data/024263.wav|why did they go through all the effort
data/017146.wav|so i i can write that off as entirely as a business expense because what i'm doing is using the sub to get invited to
data/015503.wav|the they're like flat even and it'll be interesting to see which one shoots up
data/016156.wav|sorry i'm trying to spread the news thanks
data/006786.wav|i do want to say one thing though so as
data/025366.wav|it's empty i'm the only one here because i'm
data/002303.wav|with the next marketing monday maybe a targeting tuesday this week i don't know we're almost there i've been working on it it's
data/030454.wav|alternating between pogs komodo hypes it was a special moment
data/009174.wav|your brain craves those dopamine hits of one
data/005359.wav|not reacting i'm stone-faced and he's looking right
data/025125.wav|it is a brand new approach to mobile game ads that just said i'm
data/014959.wav|the cost of this camera i
data/004069.wav|gave birth to our beautiful nine-month
data/027579.wav|we closely at twitter's financials start to
data/024416.wav|would be some of you have pack openings maybe
data/027568.wav|i heard about it and so a lot
data/021638.wav|with the satisfying crunch i i like
data/001226.wav|as as someone who's in the marketing
data/008930.wav|in the court process to enforce it all constitute an elaborate joke
data/027166.wav|it's all starting to hit right now do you think this will increase the
data/012799.wav|what i would do is i would only play in solo
data/005487.wav|we even have a comeback or i didn't say anything because i was i didn't
data/002318.wav|how does he even have that oh you
data/025406.wav|it's called real magic it's about a minute long and it's been called by some to be one of the worst ads of all time the
data/017506.wav|real quick i wanted to include this song somebody
data/011994.wav|who are also first order and i'm starting to realize that
data/001510.wav|it'd be on the show i'll toss you up here
data/006505.wav|i now pay later is just a fancy way of
data/003166.wav|really all living in the metaverse
data/024109.wav|this is the future of marketing
data/005324.wav|it was point crow on the other side of jarvis and me it was me then jarvis
data/012281.wav|so you know ludwig right or
data/006992.wav|where i get to that um
data/003162.wav|if the their users that's number one uh number two
data/017818.wav|so that's that thank you thank you for listening
data/015672.wav|so disney's safe that doesn't mean
data/017028.wav|what marketing and then you want
data/008527.wav|is there a point to buy twitter
data/028028.wav|when right now the target union is just launched employees
data/027246.wav|and what a good brand will build their brand on is being distinct uh and the ones
data/006018.wav|on stage and like in pressure
data/001503.wav|whether you're doing makes any sense
data/025897.wav|blizzard came out and said uh we don't
data/024480.wav|it's dvd bread so they pick tom brady who doesn't even need bread so they picked tom bread
data/008723.wav|no no no no no no it's materially
data/026295.wav|is your money when you buy the car you buy the car it's
data/021181.wav|what millennials actually look like this is the share of wealth in uh in the
data/015276.wav|willa they're made of pure muscle they have a ton of money and their current strategy
data/009914.wav|it's the wrong problem we need we need a
data/029267.wav|the final addition to their party
data/022880.wav|in fortnite back on mobile judge
data/001124.wav|or to see some of their their stuff pop up and it's like their entire shtick is
data/022446.wav|you might have bought too much into the
data/019222.wav|this was not possible not even close right not even close but I was like oh
data/018306.wav|at there with a cup of coffee at
data/004749.wav|at a at a valuation of about
data/000011.wav|and of all six of us he looks only at me he
data/019575.wav|the instrumental also in one take but on the bridge of the song which originally went you could keep it to yourself
data/011110.wav|at their fake you want to do you know that they're fake you know what i mean
data/006493.wav|it's talking about what a scam buy now pay later is but i want to give you know
data/013046.wav|so the good teachers get shifted
data/003020.wav|in a theater there i could
data/030540.wav|watch i never take i needed that but her dad uh brought
data/024512.wav|i said it's not fair we have to give you
data/012336.wav|we're all like here i've got your galactic
data/007979.wav|should be pretty fun a lot of question marks
data/029738.wav|and okay okay back to kings of
data/029460.wav|it's bad i can tell right away this game is bad and then time keeps going by
data/006779.wav|was because she had sent me a a card and so i had said
data/012860.wav|for junior and senior year late last life
data/005417.wav|i like talking to youtubers um i
data/015281.wav|like okay he's got his girlfriend come out you lure
data/031466.wav|was able to do this is just is is
data/027136.wav|and if you want to juice the economy a little bit if things are rough let's say we have a big housing crisis what you can do is you can lower the interest rate when interest rates are high like if you have money sitting in a bank you'll get you'll get a lot
data/030321.wav|i smiled they said for the first time in 30 years
data/015408.wav|normally you'd go to the theater and watch frozen and then you'd go home and buy the dvd
data/029970.wav|he would love to have like an overcoming
data/003626.wav|when you could just afford housing really cheap and
data/018611.wav|they say about it this game's
data/019063.wav|you know it's like that's the difference is love
data/025422.wav|no one was getting hurt right because it's a gaming tournament
data/004369.wav|saw a bunch of funny photos
data/019444.wav|on the same page while we're voting
data/017252.wav|in nationwide it doesn't work deliver everybody false positives like false positive hiv false positive cancer false positive for a miscarriage become the youngest billionaire ever entirely out fraud and lies
data/005178.wav|going to be a real fun it was they were
data/012236.wav|so we asked jenny from naboo and
data/019116.wav|basically now in some countries the
data/020388.wav|easily yeah good votes this is this is really good i wouldn't i don't think i'd change anything i
data/007991.wav|outside of maybe saturday so what
data/019231.wav|the teenagers are that dumb dude anyway turns out
data/022822.wav|we should buy you you're a scam but instead they said
data/024793.wav|was now upload videos saying i lost money on kitchen
data/017925.wav|and now you're like a lifelong consumer of marvel content once you've watched
data/030654.wav|the from school so he i see him in the back and he's starting to
data/005168.wav|dude it's funny all right you can see the before and after in the video i had the most i mean i've never
data/018751.wav|i think they raised the price still
data/008602.wav|i got it right here i got actually i have the document right here let me
data/006641.wav|i like that you're watching me at work
data/023408.wav|great value so it gets you in the door and then
data/023719.wav|what of these commercials they get a little bit too clever and
data/015550.wav|the a billionaire you want the clout of
data/027682.wav|at the very least he can use his ability to
data/002685.wav|wait a minute wait a minute i've already agreed to it which is a problem but i don't think this makes a
data/024836.wav|i for one character now feels like oh so i need to continue to level up
data/006172.wav|i go through the crowd to get to him uh i
data/024996.wav|am i wanted to watch it's not like espn you
data/032228.wav|and i have to sit there and watch
data/000644.wav|in multiple ways of the term they start beating the brakes off us
data/002675.wav|this is the default you have currently zero dollars first roll a two you have ten dollars to your name
data/006535.wav|like that it's like it's very obvious why they're doing this and apple only does things they think
data/012220.wav|i think there's a video maybe i'll find the video either
data/006213.wav|what getting wednesday third ever working
data/025272.wav|time on tire king after everyone's
data/015780.wav|what companies on sports rights and it's changing the game because once they lose sports they literally have nothing
data/022536.wav|the that we hire the best people today we're announcing a new job role and challenge
data/013976.wav|so i would like you guys to be aware
data/009283.wav|we'll just answer questions while that's what
data/028044.wav|get as long as they can get their message out stronger than like the counter argument they can scare enough employees away from ratifying union contracts
data/030520.wav|i love her more than me
data/010032.wav|because of course every single unfunny person is
data/002647.wav|six-sided dice okay but here's the catch you will say a number every time that number does not come up i will add ten dollars to your total theoretically you could print infinite money if
data/024886.wav|they will threaten you with losing all your progress if you don't spend money for
data/011984.wav|like an engineering room that i got sent to on a mission and it's like locked like if you go there on your own and try to open it it'll be locked but if you talk to kroy or she
data/022994.wav|it keeps saying he kept saying the app
data/023646.wav|that's crazy yeah i was reading about the history of billboards and marketing and because i had the same question i
data/024942.wav|the games like starcraft games that really were only about skill-based progression now do i think they're gone for good
data/001656.wav|are you know conservative dad type and then
data/025394.wav|if the to liquid hoodie or you could have the esx
data/003679.wav|we especially posts roosevelt there was so many harshly enforced estate taxes like the top tax rate was very high we especially post roosevelt there was so many
data/008473.wav|up quickly because honestly this is a big is a big boost so as long as he pays
data/032106.wav|anyway scar i'm really happy to be
data/008933.wav|in reading the documents and then also looking at what legal experts are saying people who i trust
data/025386.wav|me like if i was a gamer kid who
data/032367.wav|these are this is the most important hog gods
data/028781.wav|i was a smart kid and i prepared for
data/003931.wav|both we've seen in a long time
data/004971.wav|right when he was fathering secret children
data/009115.wav|do frog lemonade oh by the way i hate you
data/007399.wav|due to covered some people didn't make their flights or whatever so but it was it was it was rowdy in there it was packed and it due to covet some people didn't make their flights or whatever so
data/025686.wav|is not a great way to market a product because it has nothing to do with the product at the end of the day you remembering that creepy baby does not imply that you are more or like less likely to buy a playstation so it was kind of
data/021901.wav|works negatively and positively is if i work out during the day if i
data/010769.wav|that's my that's my experience uh from
data/011404.wav|two years bro thank you hey before we get
data/018625.wav|this is crazy and they said next year we're
data/007847.wav|i just listened to two hours of tupac
data/022368.wav|we're going to go on hold
data/005434.wav|and i want to shout out my
data/003169.wav|a lot of money and nothing's really happened from it yet and then the third big problem is
data/012819.wav|if the and bigger and then we were super excited
data/014786.wav|i was signed up for that but
data/009865.wav|and dense building in cities is really cool
data/030314.wav|well this is a very real story
data/018731.wav|usually gives you a prestige factor
data/025737.wav|with the product it's like yeah that's called a movie it's like if i watched
data/027143.wav|is more expensive to borrow companies start collapsing companies that were like basically shoddily run zombie companies yeah our entire economy is basically
data/026077.wav|and remember doing a game show with me and if you know there is
data/012218.wav|was like plus one plus two minus three minus
data/013891.wav|the deep themes of this six hour epic
data/003078.wav|i've noticed that even though i'm doing the same type of updates i'm getting more comments like hey man this is really depressing i'm getting a lot more comments on my youtube they're like hey wow
data/018815.wav|the hot ones Youth color attractive and he's
data/026145.wav|sue me he called a bomb threat to the conference
data/007154.wav|when it comes to social issues my
data/009290.wav|the the problem with loot boxes is people can't really make an informed choice one because
data/010456.wav|out by friday so have a little bit of time and for shimmer events i can have a lot of out by friday so i have a little bit of time and for streamer events i have a lot of
data/012754.wav|what else on earth he but think about this so at one point he had i
data/031727.wav|we hunt down the writer or the producer
data/022713.wav|smiling because he just made a
data/022087.wav|is holidays most specifically as a marketer that loves seeing
data/003398.wav|i think there was just too many positive ones um is there anything at all
data/012112.wav|he's not doing the quick time event
data/025702.wav|in months and months and months
data/017283.wav|the original winnie the pooh becomes public domain so i think you can see where this is going and i expect
data/012050.wav|power with the force but it's
data/027601.wav|i got fooled by a pool ball seven
data/002029.wav|this in the west at least a marginalized
data/007649.wav|a cool thumbnail check out my thumbnail
data/029052.wav|and i'm like we're both breathing heavy
data/026531.wav|yeah bro give me the music uh
data/028933.wav|the shows me in the bathroom
data/003580.wav|something has to change because the price of goods and
data/020395.wav|good ideas chat you guys will be great marketers one day
data/004201.wav|five months bagel boy thank you for the five months on the very
data/021831.wav|it was convincing them to give him money basically for the business and i found that he's a pretty good writer and so i think that made me more likely to trust
data/012671.wav|steve drama didn't steve finally win a major
data/004751.wav|and he acquired all this money through debt
data/026627.wav|billion dollars in cash on hand google has 170
data/011449.wav|we value i like to save for marketing
data/025372.wav|i was like yeah i did everything i was like yep i said that that's me and
data/024870.wav|ways they do that let me let me show you one of the psychological principles they
data/008702.wav|so much stuff that i think is unlikely and
data/025164.wav|oh about a year ago about a year ago today
data/025477.wav|the big mouse company's market share by being a little bit more nimble around
data/025834.wav|wizard of the situation well first of all they were approached by many many people to make league of legends film and tv properties and they turned them all down to use the people
data/014224.wav|been hustling that are ready to take their primes like for example well maybe not the young part but if you
data/002034.wav|he's kind of throaty goaty and hopefully
data/027004.wav|very clever ad and and i think bold and
data/007083.wav|if someone wanted a picture and i was like oh aidan
data/026511.wav|it's um it's very funny that the the
data/014814.wav|in all their games so like you can buy ghost recon let's see
data/031397.wav|amazon i got money from the stream and the youtube
data/015206.wav|are competing with peacock why try to outbid them on a few things that are only relevant to americans when
data/013861.wav|gamers are liars they buy it because
data/001452.wav|you are the last guest that this show concept will ever have okay okay so this is a real big opportunity for you i want to put
data/003828.wav|the rise of a third party demanding certain things usually
data/021573.wav|the the person i don't it's illegal the naked short
data/019250.wav|top and then every girl will
data/006332.wav|well i'm not ignoring your perspective
data/002933.wav|it was fine it was not it
data/027625.wav|thanks because he's the world's richest man he can tell china to
data/031131.wav|i hate talking about this because i don't i feel like everyone is making the same points and i don't want to do it it's like it's easy to go be like oh my god ludwig what a hard worker it's but you know
data/017479.wav|senior management who have you know destroyed the value of that company over the past few years
data/015791.wav|that's it those are not big players
data/020760.wav|mark zuckerberg man of the year the marketing monday man of the year this is a gender neutral award but it dates back to the
data/027453.wav|the voice of the taco bell people was one of the first
data/027077.wav|into the year pretty mid a few standouts but
data/002857.wav|so it seems very likely that uh there's
data/003476.wav|here let me get maya and then also
data/023231.wav|i think they were healthy but i didn't think they were bad i remember going to the store and i was like
data/023534.wav|are you would on their car and percentage-wise
data/004841.wav|it's really because within that three months he also has
data/025225.wav|this is a fail on all my friends in college
data/000960.wav|korea china and uh and they were
data/031263.wav|at the counter like like i'm an employee i'm just at the counter of an orange julius with my laptop out
data/024538.wav|one thing that may cause them a lot of money down the road the judge did say that looking at all of the
data/027678.wav|the thousand dollars a month for twitter that sounds good that sounds good but that is the type of groundbreaking thinking that
data/022816.wav|actually made was worth this much and time warner which made about
data/004428.wav|is he a minion can i just say that it is really awesome when a single meme from a single stream drags on for weeks months years
data/016349.wav|you're not give him the credit let's do
data/015586.wav|they failed spectacularly it was one of the biggest dumpster fires in history they lost all
data/006317.wav|long answer to me and like people could have easily been like yeah keep it up or something stupid so i got
data/012689.wav|or days until your whole life is rotted
data/016729.wav|it'll be as low as four now there's a lot of work to be done i'm sure on taste but eventually they'll be able to create sustainable
data/009460.wav|a fiesta of a game oh my god i cannot
data/013866.wav|the long game and trying to win the cloud uh so that was a win on predictions
data/013803.wav|thank god for scientists always pushing things forward in ways that we really do need
data/027580.wav|to realize this company is already overvalued
data/012791.wav|but i did meet other grinders and
data/003174.wav|finally passed instagram as the most
data/023309.wav|and move on which is it takes discipline and cocoa
data/023429.wav|you know what i'm saying and energy is usually a function of like health like if you're healthy you get
data/023860.wav|one of the biggest boons of all time but this time around marketers are smarter and they've learned
data/024209.wav|when people that only watch minecraft creators and other minecraft
data/000258.wav|big squad we got like 10 people and they're
data/026879.wav|the story which was punctuated with two bad
data/032122.wav|of streamers we have ludwig give it up for
data/008861.wav|where all these lawyers that get
data/005630.wav|if the happen like literally nothing happened like
data/010617.wav|it's saturday for some fall guys you mean elric no i don't
data/002094.wav|the thing about hearthstone that i love is the the
data/011999.wav|it's wanted to help out kroy
data/027578.wav|if they'd been looking at it internally to make their case if they should get elon musk
data/003738.wav|and that corporations could basically donate to politicians and it was legal and like they could make these
data/016690.wav|i spent a lot of time basically using apps using
data/024318.wav|what i've heard from further research is that
data/001970.wav|well obviously at first but i think i'm
data/021214.wav|hundreds x times more than the average show disney if you'll notice has is actually pretty light on
data/016857.wav|a million dollars plus in salary
data/030145.wav|if the on stream for two weeks straight yeah
data/021144.wav|so to me given the problems they were probably facing and their goal this ads effective
data/013680.wav|go all right ready tag yourself
data/003638.wav|we are over the next few years about
data/014728.wav|wait what the hell is this dude
data/032278.wav|we'd barely gambled everyone's like yeah yeah
data/000910.wav|i think something maybe you could watch that and
data/022794.wav|and they found out instantly like the second the deal was signed the housing market started really collapsing and they started realizing all
data/016820.wav|tailwinds it's doing quite well so
data/026398.wav|interact with a brand beyond the clock that
data/027138.wav|the government has been continually lowering interest rates to try and juice the economy and then after
data/013696.wav|we're really going to get something good i
data/005119.wav|it was like i just forgot about it and it was up
data/012511.wav|i didn't pay for travel like i i paid
data/004001.wav|great night thanks for supporting and uh
data/022122.wav|mood last night all good mp thanks for checking in
data/026445.wav|the end of my stream when everyone spams atrox
data/027472.wav|that is good that is good because who wants to be the idiot still talking about
data/027020.wav|way to make what they were doing appealing in the environment of the last
data/020262.wav|it's so important marketers get lost in the idea
data/011098.wav|what are we talking about oh my god what a waste
data/010802.wav|like masterpiece legend and like it makes people cry like it's
data/019451.wav|that's not really the point the point is to if you are a car buyer or if ever in your life you are searching for car insurance or whatever to have in your consideration set this brand so if i'm not hungry for
data/026260.wav|this past year massive money printed by the
data/020037.wav|with the originally and that is google's acquisition of
data/024657.wav|and now companies in the west like
data/009920.wav|bro the other day didn't you just
data/023669.wav|okay where am i staying tonight well now they
data/008008.wav|whoops i want to check out
data/017789.wav|actual moment but i only have one i have one or two maybe i have maybe sheesh was a
data/007219.wav|i've watched it's one of the biggest like breakout runs of
data/021261.wav|you know why because no one knows the name because it's one of the worst name products in
data/031897.wav|it out and he pulls out this big paper mache heart with her name on it and he's like bro i'm
data/017511.wav|it's like i'm a different man now i have different goals i have different i understand what's important
data/008594.wav|in the back out later the contract you know specifies that he's waving his right to discovery
data/022361.wav|let me tell you it cleared up my back it smells good and
data/031761.wav|is this a show or is this
data/025183.wav|put emphasis on the o instead i
data/023722.wav|i would just want to include
data/029890.wav|if your twitter let me follow you we're just
data/020439.wav|it's just obvious they couldn't even get him in the studio it's a one tank jake first take
data/000690.wav|john drinking come to the real restaurant and so after we finish the drink they
data/026943.wav|think rocket mortgage right now i think it'd
data/029566.wav|it felt like a really positive trend that ultimately
data/013209.wav|people that can't afford health like
data/014266.wav|i know this is not relevant anymore
data/007392.wav|grind out a tournament is often really
data/026433.wav|do this to have loud uh
data/026837.wav|the seconds for 7 million dollars so you
data/009839.wav|well you and my dad would get along my dad loves
data/028275.wav|or thing and it's like all fours except for one guy
data/021295.wav|improve vod or discoverability at all as a former
data/017419.wav|i read this article was how much of it seemed to be based off of number one
data/028635.wav|i'm platt and i keep dying i keep losing
data/028870.wav|and now i can't even sniff jack daniels
data/016503.wav|well i'll give him credit for here if a trend is
data/020387.wav|it's a great it's really good i mean this is a
data/024238.wav|my my listen it's a i think it's bad i'm
data/019715.wav|is graph today this is the percentage of um the
data/024676.wav|state media in china their biggest
data/008465.wav|i mean for keeping your stream going it's another
data/007595.wav|was it fails are we do about the bigger i'm down from wins it fails all right we doing this no
data/002506.wav|add quest it's a really fun side quest
data/020432.wav|can bring us all together this year because it is it is the thirstiest time of the year let's watch that ad the
data/011174.wav|because i just hang on my friends
data/005196.wav|i don't want to spoil the
data/027677.wav|if the bucks a month for twitter someone like slime would have to pay like a hundred bucks a month
data/000922.wav|in the world and not one person has been able to pick something it's
data/022899.wav|that money because we provide a great service because of it we use the money to stop malware stop viruses to weed out bad stuff we need that money if you don't like it
data/014123.wav|so it turns out again in the post drake era in the post
data/017249.wav|tend to be steve jobs create a fake blood testing company
data/005412.wav|me i'm literally giving you money
data/030373.wav|ring was as i was planning but she
data/013609.wav|got everything covered one more second on the song one more one more one more round in the song
data/027505.wav|we got to this moment uh
data/010417.wav|in cities so rural areas probably are getting
data/024075.wav|i have through that it does look kind of sinister i got a video here of let's see more it looks less like less sinister
data/025230.wav|i just stopped inviting me to parties because i play too much league of legends the the fail this week is whoever the chinese version of matriarch is i just stopped inviting me to parties because i played too much league of legends the the fail this week is
data/003401.wav|it's i have a what's up beijing but it

data/028562.wav|ninja all right you're the one
data/003387.wav|in got out and i'm happy because i don't
data/007024.wav|and it played super well i was i was messing kids up
data/026929.wav|you cringe or be offensive they got the message across this is one of the
data/005937.wav|are you more or less likely to tune in next time
data/005889.wav|the of comparison he thought he was the first person to think of the i'm the michael jordan of
data/003082.wav|people are feeling it in their uh
data/002291.wav|i think come back as a 30k andy
data/007019.wav|i that i really wanted to shout them
data/019962.wav|and aladdin and the little mermaid and it was like all of the iconic characters that everybody loved were from
data/010395.wav|megabits download available wireless option it's good for
data/030001.wav|you're getting you have like 98
data/031848.wav|in the middle of nowhere i'm gonna be the kind of league streamer
data/025914.wav|it got extreme negative pushback everyone rose up of course is
data/006520.wav|what you can at the time there is there's never
data/027385.wav|well company that's been stealing sonic
data/009153.wav|this man i'm gonna get in and i buy
data/012506.wav|well they put a lot of effort into it but i think they
data/026167.wav|about the sexual assault lawsuits anymore yeah who's
data/001651.wav|and then i get a cat and i change my
data/020265.wav|your time they make you cry and you have no idea what you're buying if you just do one and two you're just
data/024972.wav|example but high up in the united states is lego lego is one of the quote unquote most hated brands due to this methodology and it's because people on social media were writing that they stepped on
data/010437.wav|cheese fondue yeah there's gonna be some sort of like
data/024588.wav|will shape the future of business dynamics yeah that's kind of interesting but what's more important was the secret trial the secret undercurrent of a trial
data/029093.wav|we were at evo he like brought the baby to evo
data/000656.wav|we could lose quite a bit and still a lot of
data/018176.wav|want to make a chat joke i am 50 years older than the oldest one
data/019737.wav|the computer but i don't suck movies and it's like
data/024643.wav|almost any other way and so every part of china was doing this and it created what was called
data/000905.wav|want to scroll back to your first message we're going to learn about you before i
data/008831.wav|one cannot buy nvidia nvidia's is far too
data/007272.wav|listen if he gets a big boy sponsor who's

data/015665.wav|prime video is going to keep prices low get infinite
data/024340.wav|well looks like he could not give two shits he can't wait to get
data/027221.wav|what of stuff on this map but you don't see it on their map and in comparison i pulled
data/014032.wav|i want to say this in a in a rare moment of sincerity ludwig is a big streamer obviously but bigger streamers have signed deals it's not necessarily just about the numbers that they picked up they picked up a guy getting 15 to
data/016132.wav|it's just kind of tight too i'm
data/029324.wav|world's jacket i think it was
data/018522.wav|was going to do is not make their own they're going to buy studios and then and then
data/009915.wav|we need to restrain them we need to have
data/000476.wav|ask for a blt and they say
data/020555.wav|where cyberpunk lands i think it's fair to say after all of this
data/003397.wav|i you're you're so right you're so right king uh i believe
data/007971.wav|we package which means which means two things number one i
data/006267.wav|what happened with netflix and their gigantic
data/005060.wav|in the past three months he's been a bit
data/017074.wav|well not that tragic really not
data/024234.wav|at an expensive director let me check my notes here oh well okay the ad starts former
data/017922.wav|at the top of your feed
data/007561.wav|well the opera and the sydney opera you're
data/022836.wav|it up again let it pass in history this should pass
data/022562.wav|if you might be in danger of breaking your
data/017078.wav|if i know quack well and i like to think
data/022796.wav|luke can't pay them back which means that it's just a bunch of outstanding debt and within a few months i believe bank of america had to pay 50 billion
data/020358.wav|oh this one this is actually on my list
data/024107.wav|that's what he said and so in response his team
data/020644.wav|you look and you know you feel like uncomfortable other people but you still want their friendship you know like sometimes you don't want
data/002449.wav|well provider but doesn't feel like switching because he's
data/009724.wav|if the a bad but don't put yakuza vibes it's
data/022634.wav|in this screen i'm actually in a game of
data/005715.wav|i mean yeah you have to be we have to be wary which is actually probably a good point but
data/002733.wav|incredibly generous deal you are now at
data/020556.wav|game that i really like that would probably give
data/027703.wav|follow my account on there you can follow other influencers and
data/027525.wav|we're hard numbers and what i found out is they have i mean not only expensive employee salaries but they have this they have an r
data/015629.wav|they just don't have the heft they don't
data/023628.wav|i need you to understand that people don't have conversations where they randomly recommend operations to one another
data/021391.wav|and they kept shorting it because
data/002611.wav|not need to spam when aatrox
data/003424.wav|basing on the things that is being read but it's um this is the clearest
data/012536.wav|scream when i murdered that droid because you know what's funny
data/016130.wav|and we're going to keep daily uploads
data/008921.wav|well as if i'm ever in south america and need a criminal offering i will hit you up
data/025017.wav|is negative and it's a guy i guess
data/027645.wav|the saddle it with a 2 billion a
data/005542.wav|yeah it's because i told i told
data/006120.wav|well yeah so if you don't know the other
data/004823.wav|i think about it so i really appreciate mr musk
data/008073.wav|so you think that i represent all
data/028099.wav|be that a company i invested in
data/017364.wav|to do plug in a phone charger about halfway into a wall outlet then touch a penny to the exposed prongs amazon said it
data/019598.wav|in your cup it's not a song it's one of the most
data/026225.wav|any of your payments if you are delayed
data/007510.wav|you're expecting a classic burger and you eat that for dinner
data/007156.wav|project which are almost entirely economic and if we can solve the big fundamental economic problems the rest of the stuff is so much minor in comparison that is my general opinion and i don't like to alienate people by taking
data/025515.wav|the switch but what goes up must come down
data/022937.wav|we'll go out of our way to make you look like heroes you get to pick
data/021440.wav|despite what it seems like in the
data/018057.wav|this is american healthcare this is our solution oh they need help with
data/020957.wav|well if they double down i get hardened
data/022060.wav|from social media managers and teams is
data/001825.wav|but he did order the murder of jamal khashoggi
data/010673.wav|is the balloons boss i've never done the bloons boss which is like you fight a boss in balloons
data/028892.wav|my roommate diego told me this i try to dance with her and apparently my move was i kept picking her up and spitting her around like just like spinning like not dancing at all and like maybe one time that's funny but apparently like i did it a bunch of times like i would go around the party and then i would run back into her again
data/022088.wav|terrible brand tweets i look forward to seeing the one or two brands every year that think they can make a
data/031161.wav|worry about yourself why are you worried about him he's making a million dollars and he's getting
data/029150.wav|what the new batteries i turn it on there's
data/025596.wav|one announcement for the meta for some reason getting cut off is what really gets him
data/000773.wav|if they want to compete like you know you
data/012620.wav|they were talking about everything on the way out they were like okay
data/011492.wav|it's sad by the way i i am one of
data/031703.wav|yeah i gotta tell you i can't say i have
data/024534.wav|to address the court on the definition of what he was like an expert witness and what he said was it is something that has a beginning middle and end where you can get points the stand they brought
data/008737.wav|doesn't seem likely that he has anything at all to go off of
data/021698.wav|i'm going to stick with my gut and put it pretty solid so this one's
data/023854.wav|it was in the 80s but 1995
data/003838.wav|you could easily i mean for
data/026469.wav|i love for amd dude amd is
data/004295.wav|make a clip of me talking right now we're
data/011764.wav|well i didn't know that it was gonna be
data/023103.wav|i mean taco bell does this on the reg because
data/017759.wav|we know and that's mango that's mango this is this is mango if
data/017450.wav|cup partying is playing league of legends but that's what i did and that is the
data/013044.wav|with how the learning is done so everything is very rote everything is
data/013037.wav|and this time i'm going to be even
data/031647.wav|little bit of korean so i went up to this guy july zerg one
data/030367.wav|so so everything's it was hitting me
data/028629.wav|i like i did in college is if i stop working so i create this complicated plan to create fake
data/002114.wav|it was me talking about a third party
data/027528.wav|are they are indeed what is their research and development at twitter what is their
data/005460.wav|met my idol and was scared to say anything other than
data/008106.wav|like i said i'm not i'm not the only one i'm not the only one you gotta we gotta spread it around a little bit
data/027829.wav|or revenue is collapsing you think it's a good business right you take some
data/007650.wav|no idea it's called the title
data/024093.wav|two seconds ago and a pedestrian
data/021910.wav|how like the hardest part of
data/018527.wav|let's talk about some of the main things people are saying number one is they're saying oh well i heard that the games won't be exclusive let me be very clear bethesda games aaa games going forward are very very likely to not come out on
data/011983.wav|food area there's like some other areas but
data/027399.wav|why this happened with youtube it
data/005986.wav|if the community does get too much hate and um
data/031338.wav|my dad's ever done when he could have
data/006754.wav|and bingo and i was thinking this would be really fun i've done some
data/005526.wav|yes how is your jumper i have not played
data/018839.wav|my eyes on you see now
data/019833.wav|and that of course is fallout
data/022279.wav|i have a trigger warning okay we're
data/021624.wav|it save the budget on the celebrity here who is cannibalizing
data/021584.wav|stop stock they didn't have and they were
data/009808.wav|it's not so interesting when you live in
data/029550.wav|experience and i think part of the reason we'd hoped for it yeah
data/023681.wav|you think this is good you think that's a good tweet
data/028131.wav|a bunch of companies were skipping the process going public making a bunch of money from investors
data/017713.wav|a walking advertisement for their brand
data/008494.wav|i don't know about big brand content
data/007407.wav|it was really fun although i will say look the
data/013516.wav|which perhaps from ma'am breast breast like hill
data/030049.wav|it's absolutely good thing because it's
data/006425.wav|it'll take him an hour or so in the meantime you hop into clash of guilds
data/030959.wav|the spirit you're right it is actually about
data/010584.wav|you meow to try and get access is that is that what i'm
data/030466.wav|at it so i was like so i pulled my shirt up at the on the beach and it said will you and then i turned around and then
data/021575.wav|i get carrots for 10 bucks and you're like okay deal
data/016080.wav|and it's run by a company called
data/031371.wav|that was my that was my understanding
data/022184.wav|what makes it so silly is the gold this
data/002480.wav|that's me but with fortnite explain that how is that you but with fortnite do you buy a bunch of fortnights for
data/002038.wav|what what am i what am i getting crucifix earrings no i'm not kev walks but does he run
data/002198.wav|it's good for everyone to be more informed is like
data/024402.wav|this one on video games i
data/011879.wav|it was one of the coolest parts was where i got to be here
data/025287.wav|i don't watch it even though i already know the story because i played the
data/011583.wav|good luck i hope you get it godspeed don't have to call
data/032171.wav|i hit i hit the field i double up
data/006223.wav|especially because i can't read them
data/016781.wav|this is a real problem millennial the
data/014490.wav|i figured he could help us explain what's going on first i found this amazing metaphor by
data/003123.wav|you hear you worked there i did work
data/021159.wav|so though it made it's more of a smiley

data/021808.wav|thanks to the power of the
data/014934.wav|we were talking about the dominant way people consume media currently in the

data/020460.wav|on points with the story a lot of games have been
data/026817.wav|what they just sort of slide so facebook realized that their core business is
data/015707.wav|i'm going to give them a try because
data/015362.wav|the video let's get back to the content
data/005931.wav|elaborate yes now i got a couple
data/021328.wav|so much is that we're entering the year of loneliness because people are looking for any
data/019679.wav|want to listen to it it's there hopefully they
data/011793.wav|it looks like you're taking off
data/014998.wav|people are just watching less sports
data/027257.wav|the gamers the fact that they choose not to do it does not mean that they couldn't do it you know what i'm saying elden ring runes are for sale on ebay right now and they could tap into it and they choose not to
data/014958.wav|as a streamer i could necessarily deduct
data/015933.wav|it'll put her in the thumbnail and so you'll be like oh
data/015057.wav|they have what apple had in iphones
data/030295.wav|if the only messages like old
data/028162.wav|if compensation their ceo gets paid 1.38
data/016555.wav|more them scary employers could demand a dna check and see if you have genes that make you more likely to be i
data/019189.wav|massive success Sega tried to go for
data/025933.wav|because these are two games that launched and haven't done that well on blizzard's side they
data/021672.wav|we know what they say when life gives you a
data/002979.wav|during the power of the theater experience he's putting it all back
data/029352.wav|i was doing um like league
data/009090.wav|so many fun songs like so many fun songs and you guys are going to hear them i don't care how long it takes me to find them i want you guys to hear the fun songs
data/002954.wav|if the like everyone's talking about the gray man do
data/006228.wav|you idiots get bluffed if you lose call them
data/025397.wav|oh my fashion icon slime dude that's
data/031006.wav|he was pretty he was like you know kind of frustrated and then christmas happened and i
data/030009.wav|go to your door right now how
data/003908.wav|cuban it might be gavin newsom it might be
data/030809.wav|with a group of friends on one of my first
data/024887.wav|oops the balloon got through and ran
data/022280.wav|but it might be really sad so don't watch it
data/015732.wav|on this i've done this this is apparently
data/030593.wav|iran cahoots and you guys answer it
data/023412.wav|but that was really satisfying to beat i think once
data/027226.wav|this is this is more um
data/021588.wav|cause not everybody is committed to the mission but all the people that heard about this from their barber or you know saw it on the news or heard about it from a friend or they're not diamond hands dude they just bought it
data/016556.wav|the major health breakthroughs there's benefits and downsides and that's the one thing
data/030742.wav|all of the above baby all of the above
data/010306.wav|because what if he doesn't want
data/003654.wav|i was like that and the money was using other things
data/023006.wav|and we'll go our own way all right you know
data/006920.wav|you probably noticed the title eric
data/008230.wav|it's not going to work outside of that
data/026496.wav|damn so i guess now they are going to try and make their own separate intellectual property what
data/000170.wav|how the hell did you a literal tiger yes
data/024827.wav|the days of games having like relatively small level of pay to win like horse armor for two dollars are completely gone okay if you want to you should have no end
data/031592.wav|so that's why i think broodware's so
data/030511.wav|and i go on one knee and
data/031230.wav|in america so what i would do is i would
data/002207.wav|it was next week but i'll just tell you
data/027369.wav|well i think they understand what's most important in the world of branding
data/004240.wav|i don't get so many comments like that
data/028452.wav|no chips all right this is chekhov's gun yes this is chekhov's gun in screenwriting
data/020993.wav|today because i was so baffled and shocked by their review of the funniest ad i
data/002031.wav|editor well he's a ticket editor who
data/000384.wav|i'm drinking um quite a bit at
data/023380.wav|i don't care where it is where i find it i like logic puzzles
data/014374.wav|we this and get really well and working really well
data/005032.wav|and then a bunch of bots give you dopamine
data/004386.wav|mean that i will pay you so real
data/030662.wav|she says this he says this lake known for having
data/023426.wav|i think one of the biggest
data/001466.wav|american education wins again congrats thank you so much
data/004824.wav|well babies left and right to try and uh turn
data/021978.wav|who wants to pay those dues to the union
data/017129.wav|oh thank you finally this hero has saved
data/003699.wav|it like an example i would give is like you know people think oh my god a company
data/024943.wav|good absolutely not the cool thing about the pendulum is that as the market shifts towards one way the few people remaining on the other
data/023052.wav|their ambitions because they're not gonna have
data/010954.wav|nothing to do with that so
data/022420.wav|in the better at or we have 13 more
data/013395.wav|and then if i tell you the truth which
data/008047.wav|it would hurt my throat because it's a hard voice to do for
data/016104.wav|i taught you nothing i apologize i regret
data/005719.wav|at the top to bottom dude an absolute gigantic
data/017753.wav|on this on on marketing monday in general but i can absolutely be impressed by some of the investments they've made in
data/023654.wav|it's like a cool it's like uh you know
data/003388.wav|i don't want to see the robots come for him though it would be cool if we
data/012366.wav|the galaxy's edge is that he's not an actor
data/026692.wav|they get the hundred million dollars twitch makes no money back almost no money back it's a big disaster okay but the
data/032222.wav|and now it's been two times with no
data/023549.wav|all the competition and then you that's how you do you outlast your competition you lower the price outlast competition and then
data/024932.wav|don't get people to pay for pay you because there's no reason to so make sure grinding and paying are legitimate versions of progressing
data/009143.wav|his decision to sign on the dotted line waive the
data/015015.wav|quack i don't want the roku sound
data/018727.wav|will be good but right now
data/002565.wav|it's so much then i'm gonna
data/011521.wav|i have internet access i read everything in the discord and i read everything on
data/028447.wav|when the base i get a subway sandwich i get a subway sandwich and lay's potato
data/030858.wav|great great well hey when you're my boss
data/023687.wav|bmw like the bmw brand with a pride flag
data/018315.wav|acquisition company is what it means companies going public is a very long and arduous process let's
data/021129.wav|the roof is behind the times it it's not
data/000554.wav|is very baller so so at this point we're all up money by the way literally
data/032159.wav|that's the long and short of it but there's this bet called the field okay
data/019137.wav|the zone and it'll be here by tomorrow
data/002606.wav|you are probably heads here it
data/000002.wav|i remember it you were crazy on
data/018421.wav|absolutely absurd amount of money on marketing that out of the gate to get almost no subscribers i mean really bad amazon luna i think is here we're talking about what's good
data/030384.wav|i original plan uh i really
data/015128.wav|sticking around longer people are signing up
data/011833.wav|we tried it and so i get in i get on the ship and
data/006557.wav|how the bn part and not the pl part
data/015508.wav|if you notice if you notice
data/003454.wav|right now taiwan serves the entire globe
data/031699.wav|with the question like hey have
data/030439.wav|it all right so this is important because you
data/012979.wav|like overworked teachers and so it's like or probably even
data/024665.wav|take these big losses on the chin from things like evergrand they start to
data/008981.wav|will he get a discount if he buys twitter during prime day twitch you could buy
data/019655.wav|well out of on drink because i was gonna drink because i worked for
data/025780.wav|we said that and she quit three months in then they cancelled
data/001897.wav|so i don't run the ads twitch runs ads for you like no matter what
data/017933.wav|doing terribly there are probably teams with bad lazy
data/018495.wav|dwarfing all of this by a massive factor was bethesda and all of its games in perpetuity bethesda and zenimax for seven and a half billion
data/008109.wav|okay last day of february and all
data/010740.wav|all the oh no it's off again oh
data/020620.wav|yeah right here i love it fortnite baby and now
data/025424.wav|can still be friends and compete there's not no one's getting hurt it's not a real war and then this commentator
data/016876.wav|is dying and this includes all
data/008680.wav|it's forever is fraudulent and the entire company doesn't make sense and everything because then you
data/003281.wav|when actual win here i'm being serious okay
data/011711.wav|go through a checkpoint and we go into like this prison
data/016974.wav|it's the water we'll put on the keys
data/010615.wav|lyric that's right me and larry the
data/007788.wav|like i put out content consistently and keep doing it keys react yeah

data/024140.wav|was the first wave with mixer mixer was throwing money around again microsoft the most viable company on planet earth
data/012374.wav|if everybody's into it and they would have played along and he's like yeah and he just
data/015701.wav|if you are a freelancer or a side hustler you almost assuredly
data/002280.wav|of all time isn't it illegal to do that yeah so what are they gonna do
data/012320.wav|like for the kids that didn't want to
data/007033.wav|at w even says big a
data/029976.wav|i did i did i was number one on twitch first time ever i believe
data/010860.wav|in a different life in a different era this is who i'd be i am like this i actually i
data/001180.wav|we off with code paul gay
data/007050.wav|isn't that odd isn't that odd hey truck why didn't you
data/001613.wav|well look through there we're gonna
data/002468.wav|if they weren't like super fans of lays they
data/012217.wav|with your five card hand and your hand
data/005628.wav|what he said but instantly the second
data/006344.wav|and buck whiskey thank you okay let's do it
data/007851.wav|we're presentation on the life and times of
data/005179.wav|during daggers at me the point is you'll see in the video but
data/006519.wav|interest so my recommendation is always to not use
data/018893.wav|the shows are 10 minutes or less
data/012583.wav|was clicking gaming this every bit of down
data/000519.wav|we get a text to come to
data/015824.wav|let me check keith here what
data/009774.wav|i saw what did i see oh i saw some
data/024071.wav|week is taco bell actually you
data/004942.wav|this company is going to crater unless they can they can prove that they can hold
data/007771.wav|it's a marketing monday we're talking about hey whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
data/031645.wav|are very good translator and so nobody from all the bigger press outlets like all the people that were much bigger than than than team liquid at the time
data/031787.wav|so last time we talked about this the big invasion was the minecraft kids the minecraft creators had staked out a gigantic piece of twitch island but in fact if anything their influence has shrunk since last time
data/023311.wav|it was forgotten about by the next day so that's a win for coke i was impressed
data/012469.wav|if the was repaired we get a celebratory
data/014485.wav|and that's a good sign that's a good sign for them that they've done something right to convince him because he
data/013927.wav|are empowering you this is debt this is loan sharking under a different name it is debt it is actually worse and more expensive than credit cards and everyone you look at the reasons people
data/027979.wav|i actually didn't hear that is that true
data/019078.wav|i don't think we're anywhere close to fake news
data/004317.wav|at the end so we got a lot we got a lot we got a lot
data/018732.wav|apple's the most valuable company on earth how
data/024501.wav|in stronger and more powerful with better lawyers and they won and if
data/021465.wav|literally 50 plus billion dollars i mean
data/009761.wav|in spoil i there's no thing to spoil after
data/007964.wav|minus my fee of course after my fee
data/015378.wav|like succession and game of thrones and outside of the final season and
data/008012.wav|i like it i checked the box i like it for
data/019502.wav|in the football game or a soccer game or something and you'll see just like a logo like like walls of logos around the edge of the stadium like what does that really do what
data/024240.wav|it gets a bad ad because it literally is one of
data/005120.wav|fact that down the the month
data/020513.wav|no it doesn't dude it doesn't the other thing they did was they didn't allow reviewers to use footage from consoles in their reviews they literally blocked it you were only
data/011073.wav|comment you know no not even a little broom
data/015592.wav|but extra money from the markets and uh
data/009314.wav|it'd be interesting but how about just not gamble easy peasy yeah it's easy for some people i'd say most people if they're starting to have a financially ruinous situation over gambling can stop but some people have a very difficult time
data/007337.wav|with i won the bet and then
data/026506.wav|if the creators to make new things and allow everyone a chance to own and invest in the ips they create we all have a story
data/007647.wav|on marketing monday streaming wars in fact i am and in fact i just paid avernell an
data/018981.wav|in dollars prime video spends like
data/026994.wav|probably the biggest story of the ads and that is the coinbase
data/025605.wav|but with the change of facebook to meta
data/030042.wav|i loved it thank you damn that was not
data/020779.wav|released this year facebook groups kazoo perhaps and the marketing monday the monday for best ad of the year goes to
data/000662.wav|but on sunday it was just ludwig and he was taking thousands of dollars he was running over to
data/026875.wav|you know they also taste great on salads
data/023236.wav|it's literally a jolly rancher pop-tart
data/031154.wav|what the people would say something like
data/007153.wav|it's not like a place that i generally
data/015300.wav|if the also bought the warner estate which was basically the biggest most
data/011455.wav|no i'm not you listen i
data/003695.wav|bad as now and something happened like you know roosevelt added those
data/026302.wav|yeah of the clock they used to be a bigger advertising company but they really have
data/028073.wav|the only reason that apple got into the iphone
data/003805.wav|yeah there's no way that would go wrong or be twisted or abused or turn into mob violence no it's good i'm sure that'll be
data/008622.wav|if the for being an idiot and twitter is hurt because
data/031843.wav|im content where's ninja where's ninja
data/018829.wav|internet like he never the main character in this thing never takes a swig
data/000658.wav|but i remember and then again i was a little drunk but
data/013083.wav|king and then smoke with us
data/027291.wav|is why wouldn't you just add like who does it hurt
data/005397.wav|i learned that jarvis was formerly in a discord group for
data/011639.wav|we're gonna try it out so i booked the tickets
data/016552.wav|now you can do it for less than a thousand
data/015163.wav|now i'm not sure how many of
data/008125.wav|because i'll never use thank you and have a good one not appreciating my gift
data/006101.wav|i fainted for an online tournament that is real he
data/011337.wav|not streaming tomorrow i'm definitely going
data/030233.wav|you can't hear the sound but they're they're hitting each other like it
data/025865.wav|and that sort of cheap ass attitude that like us us first kind of thing is so backwards looking and
data/005871.wav|at the table trying to find
data/001135.wav|i can't imagine that that that is as
data/006129.wav|and i have to buy the ninja monkey one and then burn it
data/013332.wav|isn't it isn't it a value that you carry with you to be true to your word
data/011088.wav|i was talking about sphinx uh sphinx
data/014494.wav|it's offers so what happens when you don't get offers right if i only have one option to buy a bagel and i
data/015261.wav|in their market share their global
data/032085.wav|robin why would you ever upload that
data/005277.wav|where people are all loudly talking to each
data/025978.wav|past few years riot and blizzard and what their different strategies
data/000761.wav|i just tell me if it's terrible or genius while we were walking around this is probably sunday when i was thinking of ways here's how we're
data/021503.wav|and they have to get it down quickly so
data/000080.wav|three months your mom's dormant thank you for
data/016936.wav|let me talk about public real quick which is a investment app it is similar to an investment app you may know it
data/022027.wav|because if you get too risque or flamboyant the first reaction is often the permanent reaction
data/021872.wav|wrote except for those texts you sent to
data/004666.wav|and she like she had like a gazillion shares and was like you know
data/021228.wav|please watch the office more just buy the
data/026863.wav|whenever they have that they have that um
data/022520.wav|opera now it actually looks kind of good mcdonald's is much better at this
data/020794.wav|i thought that was a fantastic ad for a lot of reasons i think it was one of the first
data/029158.wav|they had the little thing where you could press on them to see how full they
data/031534.wav|an aggressive like all in usually like he splits the whole map and just turtles up and gets a gigantic army and you can't beat him but here he is going all out trying to get a
data/029189.wav|i wouldn't call them riots i would call them peaceful
data/025255.wav|mario's little brother luigi will be played by charlie day i'm excited for
data/020314.wav|okay so i got you something dude you did
data/010709.wav|can't wait for jimmy beast to come
data/005683.wav|fucking great time it was actually just me
data/013322.wav|you guys as far as i can throw you and i
data/002170.wav|start slow at first and then really
data/027994.wav|crunched i'm sure still buggy launch and
data/026854.wav|ooh successful she sailed into the setting sun as a seashell celebrity
data/027555.wav|why the whole company and then they started to
data/006445.wav|the zip describing is ideal future this is him describing his ideal future
data/008671.wav|well have to find a nail salon
data/025368.wav|i have your best shot but i was like yeah i mean i did say yes i didn't i didn't
data/001101.wav|interest you have you could be super interested in like i
data/025451.wav|what have wanted that's the first win of the day let me
data/014977.wav|we're going to approach the war and now they're
data/012610.wav|so it's a good start it's a good start
data/017016.wav|okay everyone knows that good marketing requires a
data/024596.wav|because i have three wins that are kind of small and one fail that is very very very very very very large first
data/005500.wav|it's tough it's tough to like know how to fit into that conversation because everyone is so gone and they're having
data/025773.wav|has had possibly the best in this past week this would happen for blizzard okay number one diablo
data/027218.wav|unique aspect they did with not hand
data/013399.wav|it was voice it was just magical i don't believe my eyes your name will
data/024934.wav|the truth is he tried a skill game does it make as much money people don't like to compete on skill they the truth is he tried a skill-based game it doesn't make as much money people
data/026236.wav|start to miss payments will cut you off so it's dead on training wheels you'll still have to pay
data/008826.wav|eight months to a year i feel like if you go back
data/013701.wav|cream twitter and all that people are obsessed with
data/002412.wav|nah nah i'll take it now you guys don't get that one yeah you have enough to
data/029074.wav|in the camera he gets an early
data/010706.wav|is it every store yeah so it's like one of the i think people don't talk enough about how retail jobs actually have a huge advantage over
data/019877.wav|at the top four here number four on the most overhyped games of all time star wars battlefront is a perfect number
data/001282.wav|it's extra weird because at the same
data/024485.wav|it's just two fails in the great war between
data/024042.wav|and everyone hated new coke and they demanded to bring back the old coke and they got all rallied up about
data/002428.wav|big bang bullets thinking of the prime
data/004905.wav|little fingers and then began to say that he was going to basically acquire the rest of the company and just keep growing his share
data/024278.wav|hard marketing monday head it's called
data/004300.wav|that's literally not quiet dude why
data/015582.wav|what they're simple they're cheap and
data/015402.wav|so that that's given them a second
data/003647.wav|capitalism is the competition from innovation and the only way that works
data/009944.wav|i ever before like it doesn't stop you on the internet
data/030301.wav|i've already put out the invite
data/020054.wav|crazy crazy bears acquisition i mean youtube is the internet for a lot of people this is it this is video on the internet yahoo exec rips google for overpaying for youtube
data/004489.wav|it's funny people like him but
data/013183.wav|we all watch you every night i know for
data/006206.wav|i'm so tired it's just like
data/013768.wav|well the sexual assault lawsuits anymore
data/025577.wav|if some of the exciting games in the pipeline for quest absolutely over the years we've had the opportunity to work
data/003856.wav|that was coming from whoever was president

data/031280.wav|i'm getting scared because he's going to
data/026231.wav|a the credit card and if you pay up a credit card every month it's the exact same
data/021623.wav|it's kind of like slice of life stuff and then you
data/000760.wav|so i had a video idea
data/027029.wav|it's so basic it's a complete nothing burger this is their big comeback head oh guy
data/019399.wav|and show this and talk about how good our company was doing we crushed them dude by quarter eight it was an absolute laughing stock we
data/030319.wav|was like he had traveled he's like
data/026935.wav|i like his vibe get your dream house all in one place with rocket homes and rocket mortgage in my mind
data/005763.wav|literally it's like there's a camera on him even though there's no cameras it's like there's a camera on him and like like for real
data/011436.wav|so yeah it should be fun should be it should be a good ass week
data/027074.wav|instantly dies i'd be bold that'd be
data/015630.wav|i don't have the ability to create great originals and they don't have the money
data/015284.wav|wrong strategy but it's a risky one okay but if it doesn't work if this doesn't work they have a powerful backup money lots and lots and lots of money that is their powerful backup okay they have a lot more money than almost anyone else
data/029622.wav|oh for the next episode i was just curious yeah
data/013557.wav|i just sort of dove into the numbers with
data/021964.wav|i made a challenge to make like a new
data/023302.wav|the destroyed oh pepsi generation this meant nothing
data/013513.wav|we collectively you probably didn't even get it
data/011034.wav|i was going to be no content until i know what
data/024013.wav|we're stopping them from getting the lines of credit and the size of accounts they would need to pay out all their creators and only fans was very worried because
data/025410.wav|we are pausing peter here real
data/024492.wav|what happened in this court case who won who lost who's the real winner who's the real loser okay because
data/028047.wav|what are the union sending a clear message to every single one of their other managers that if you don't do something to stop
data/017737.wav|and but i wanted to say this is
data/017004.wav|in two months big man jasper
data/016850.wav|to solve things that humans were able to do but slowly or not able to do at all extremely quickly and at
data/001457.wav|what's your exact address uh okay you live in america
data/014148.wav|or let's say hassan and ms
data/010852.wav|like saying hey i don't really wanna like playing you mean a
data/009720.wav|yeah i'm getting too many questions pliers remove nails
data/015195.wav|they don't have to make everything in la
data/028142.wav|it's spending 80 million dollars on but they
data/011598.wav|anyway so that's my only gripe is that i kind of wish they had just like faded in the color
data/000514.wav|can get that blt i would have been gone so i wake up and i'm good and we're we get
data/028055.wav|i mean something to you but it meant something to me okay after
data/016925.wav|i thought that was really interesting i did a lot of research on all that stuff and i
data/011072.wav|yeah i can hear you okay sick nice nice nice
data/009070.wav|okay we gotta balance it wait is that it for that
data/015622.wav|have continued into this year and they show no path to changing again if these shows didn't do it they're not getting more popular
data/022188.wav|life hack if you're a marketer because we love dogs there's an art to it
data/006664.wav|because literally last night i think i played like
data/008027.wav|a great time of course as a kid but like there was a lot of flaws in it even even then and
data/009637.wav|or something and they all chase and then
data/014048.wav|short term didn't foresee that outcome
data/030030.wav|while doing an impersonation i can do the same thing with you
data/020542.wav|of now shifted from multiplayer to bug fixing they're not doing this they're doing this so
data/006059.wav|well it's fun it's fun with friends
data/030409.wav|if she was like literally doing her own
data/030286.wav|i had to deal with dog shampoo jokes while playing league of legends with my boys
data/022714.wav|of the money for bad phones and this is the ceo
data/025751.wav|i know what this what this
data/002643.wav|this is gonna be great okay this one is
data/015471.wav|sorry frozen three like like a sequel
data/028674.wav|at the gaming people respected a dude people respected it if you did that two years later in the peak of the amazon era you at the gaming people respected it dude people respected it if you did that two
data/004100.wav|you know what i'm saying strong like bull
data/015087.wav|at the same time hollywood started waking up right as
data/012943.wav|i felt like everything that i was saying was way more valued so i took the job but that was
data/027584.wav|it's literally the same revenue as olive garden which is worth substantially less
data/000234.wav|that's against the whole table and that
data/009088.wav|six months at all how long has it
data/017448.wav|of legends which is the saddest reason of all that is
data/011745.wav|what i was referencing they just i think they put the default which is
data/000467.wav|you know i have an extra bed because i'm like
data/029167.wav|when they entered the department store to buy a water stone in order to get
data/029665.wav|one of the greatest streams i've ever seen
data/026751.wav|is that the problem governments would block it
data/010206.wav|was the effect of pepper spray upon your dick as i i must know oh i
data/028015.wav|and he has started because jeff bezos is now
data/029065.wav|as the story but it was a tough situation with curtis after that luckily for me we move all the time because my military family
data/023168.wav|painted on burger covered in wax and shoe polish it looks good but that's not how
data/008261.wav|it's like an awesome way for esports fans to
data/025252.wav|in the favorite clip on twitch to sort of sum it up talking a lot in the movie
data/002398.wav|so i wouldn't i wouldn't i wouldn't let him back
data/012046.wav|this time it's just a very obvious like the wall lights up
data/027989.wav|which is worried that the game will become the next cyberpunk so to avoid that
data/022552.wav|well as a prank really ties
data/014646.wav|in the holy day of monday feels odd feels
data/003509.wav|now in the long run over hundreds of years the stock market trends upwards and real estate prices have turned
data/027702.wav|to see what I'm looking at you can
data/011416.wav|gift for the scene i swear to god i don't
data/013377.wav|that way we start with some of the worst ones and get to one of the best ones oh my god is he a genius or just a marketer wait there's no difference
data/027130.wav|i want to explain real quick so i i want
data/024124.wav|the fail what was my fail oh yeah oh yeah yeah
data/006083.wav|i'm not much of a melee head but i saw the clip with no context
data/027868.wav|does that mean it is worth more than every single other car company combined no it doesn't make sense the
data/026993.wav|now we're getting down to the ones i wanted to talk about we could
data/011169.wav|yeah he's hard to find he's
data/002583.wav|it's a total of four but it wasn't
data/019606.wav|if they didn't even they didn't provide the music they provided just the words
data/007985.wav|yeah it's great no i know
data/017063.wav|as well as a youtube atlas both of which could be fun to explore both of which could be fun to explore i
data/003005.wav|i heard so we all get up and start going for the doors i mean i get ari ari
data/013140.wav|but they're bad at games they're trying really hard to crack games and it's so funny because riot has found it so much easier because they're already good at games they already have games and they could but they're bad at games so they're trying really hard to crack games and it's so funny because riot
data/000456.wav|we just feel that like i passed the line i
data/030854.wav|well played jigglypuff got nearly four
data/008909.wav|the a hold of me apparently has been going through my editor quack and they've been talking
data/022313.wav|impact on me as a marketer now these are not the best five ads of all time okay these are literally just five
data/005152.wav|are offered that we should go and so we did and we went
data/015317.wav|to amazon prime content is not a business on its own it's something you use to help your toilet paper
data/026990.wav|if the first of all this is one
data/003326.wav|wage increases we've seen in a while though unfortunately they are still both of them behind inflation so even if you switch jobs they got a
data/008016.wav|if the are like it but in terms of
data/024097.wav|a bike lane and you're like what if i don't have a car though what am i
data/022690.wav|a billion dollars and you're not making
data/025254.wav|i can't wait to see a very
data/018819.wav|is it's an incredibly pretentious next Bud
data/007536.wav|was looking at it dude it was so nasty like imagine
data/027896.wav|make some money now we're thinking canada what would you pay for your own country we'll give you drake
data/014212.wav|not the on instagram they'll what's that they on instagram they own whatsapp they
data/029981.wav|but that was a host number one which
data/018313.wav|marketing monday hey truck do you invest
data/000272.wav|on piecing it together we all go back to our hotel rooms and ludwig has
data/008411.wav|and so i said fire title game bro i just typed that
data/026153.wav|or tesla to make a statue of elon musk it doesn't even look like him
data/012405.wav|we ourselves so he puts his fist up and i'm
data/030160.wav|was game one he's like oh yeah you're complaining whatever whatever whatever you whatever whatever and
data/007757.wav|rather than i just i just ran like a decent speed
data/023801.wav|the sports fans sports fans love them
data/016199.wav|at least half the money goes to jeff and that's sweet you know it feels like it's a win-win it's like you can support a
data/008987.wav|well there are already free right
data/008542.wav|i know they were and they get paid a huge amount for damages because they've been obviously severely impacted people are quitting and they've been on a hiring freeze and so they're probably i think this is my guess what happens is twitter gets paid between
data/022945.wav|in this story i want that to be clear none of these companies is thinking about anything other than how do they get themselves rich but and i will say this i'll just say it up front i do lean towards the side of epic
data/026670.wav|and they said hey you need to pay us a hundred million dollars to get the rights for overwatch league to stream on twitch this
data/014227.wav|a lot bigger imagine this is someone like in the minecraft community or something it's just
data/009228.wav|smash your head is that what i'm hearing is that am i reading through the line
data/027275.wav|your core parts of the fromsoft
data/019319.wav|and we said we are going to win this thing we started a company called
data/025595.wav|cut off her boss did she ask him a question
data/016527.wav|or even starting to be born
data/007512.wav|he he didn't finish i'll tell you that if it was really good he would
data/028894.wav|after this night we really never really hit it off if you could believe it after this that it was kind of awkward when i ran into her at all the
data/029043.wav|i i see everything in slow-mo dude the
data/024971.wav|the bad sony product so let me give you an
data/019364.wav|and i went in and i i spent all of our money and more i went into debt i spent all the money the
data/020205.wav|little things hashtag the media jumped on the story case studies were written and lessons were learned about not giving the
data/023189.wav|but if they add even like a drop of fruit juice they can call it made with real fruit there's nothing healthy about it another one is
data/000722.wav|people around you and i'm so happy this is
data/027479.wav|billion dollars and we've got all of the takes in the world about it in fact i think it has created even faster
data/020398.wav|in thing yes first of all
data/025781.wav|if required to put on blizzcon
data/030549.wav|i don't know why i was so weird about it
data/019000.wav|to the release of a new champion in game timed to the
data/006511.wav|plus it's amazing but it's been proven again and again and
data/010691.wav|well i'm interested i'd like to know you know it's get a vibe check i'm doing good
data/025929.wav|in the game at the level of other major publishers the debate over what as a better game
data/014643.wav|what the first market ones that i've never done a marketing wednesday i've never done a
data/002470.wav|there was no there was no
data/008380.wav|regular job duties it was intriguing
data/019233.wav|look at the look at the time stamp and look at how much
data/026328.wav|i thought about shifting your money from here to here verizon spends a lot of money here
data/024860.wav|i don't like they're unique do they
data/020365.wav|brother and sister home for christmas
data/023417.wav|so you must have cheated and uh we all
data/023138.wav|it was insurmountable so they changed to
data/005031.wav|me tweets on twitter basically you log on
data/027056.wav|the same thing as the matt
data/007690.wav|you and east coast hours for eight nine hour
data/025786.wav|and ready to launch they would put on
data/016340.wav|a marketing dub okay he's never had a marketing dub until now and that is why
data/001256.wav|the country but for english speaking i mean
data/007003.wav|wasn't the front row for um
data/028204.wav|after it we get back to twitch and there's this thought like wow that tournament did really well but what a pain in the ass for twitch we didn't know
data/017385.wav|the marvel plus pixar plus rest of disney
data/017152.wav|thoughts on san jose living here is high
data/017714.wav|okay it is impossible to use airpods ipad iphone etc in public without people knowing what they are they they
data/022773.wav|it was just like yahoo's like we can't
data/012875.wav|in chaos and hot shot and
data/008313.wav|we can finally be classified as being in a recession are you are you excited for it are you like waiting with foam fingers
data/021494.wav|and usually it's pretty soon so when they borrowed all this stock when it was like five dollars hoping to go to four dollars they said we'll pay you back in a month
data/030762.wav|we just call was from someone higher up in the chain dude
data/009580.wav|but it's doable trying so hard
data/024843.wav|we the company to make billions when we
data/017509.wav|well when you hear a song like that
data/015058.wav|and smartphones okay if you're the first mover consumers see you as the default
data/026647.wav|if very quick turnaround on this buy
data/029391.wav|yeah but like it was like a little icy fine i can accept that all right i
data/011755.wav|anyway that was he it's in the outer rim
data/005734.wav|i think he's a smart guy i i do now now
data/016409.wav|it's not an economics class i'm not
data/007119.wav|oh speaking of the vaccine on that subject i was on my flight back
data/005332.wav|like literally like cuts jarvis out
data/023724.wav|but outside of that hilarious commercial speaking of marketing let me interrupt your regularly scheduled
data/023075.wav|in the thing in the brain that does half the
data/012309.wav|thing because that bar room has
data/011272.wav|it's just gonna stay like this true
data/010714.wav|if you grow up in a tax bracket it's only
data/000043.wav|part of the and then they're gonna when
data/028686.wav|and if you like this content content
data/029292.wav|i had gotten this possible internship at
data/023270.wav|and i labeled them and i tested it with
data/004355.wav|it actually did super well so
data/011267.wav|i'm sorry chat chat i apologize
data/017550.wav|in the past decade and a half if you had bought apple stock
data/023518.wav|five other cars that's a crazy stat ford does advertising gets his number
data/016258.wav|i was the lakers have lost 43
data/009198.wav|in the first we're gonna do a lot of stuff it's a pretty big saturday we're
data/018606.wav|ever ever guaranteed will you be able to buy a disk copy
data/001317.wav|like it wasn't appealing to me so i never thought anyone would take
data/026947.wav|well them as a solution showed their product looking easy and fun and then had the right nostalgia around it and then anna kendrick was a good pitch woman so in my mind i think this is
data/014674.wav|i actually i probably have one fail wait
data/016677.wav|i have a solution for people's bad sleep you are
data/020020.wav|it's a tough fit let's just see if we can put this on i'm
data/006161.wav|much appreciated just yeah i think the ghost really
data/016264.wav|i realize is anthony davis and russell westbrook have not been used on a losing graphic yet and i know the next question what about the winning graphics i'm
data/017677.wav|stuff has gotten they've clearly stolen
data/018105.wav|we did pepsi man in his own game
data/018590.wav|picture of a mountain be xbox exclusive elder scrolls six will this mountain be only on xbox
data/027304.wav|wigan the perfect example of that because i spent seven hours in the tree sentinel and had the best moment of my life
data/009709.wav|it's like i'm sort of the conduit for the sum total of all of humanity's knowledge on youtube and i'm channeling it through me into your brain
data/030792.wav|when asked about the cello line
data/031613.wav|he's the first white guy to ever win a
data/016952.wav|and up using my code in the link
data/009754.wav|that is how the movie goes
data/014803.wav|it has been like just signed up by millions of people
data/029328.wav|i see what they're wearing i'm like a little
data/000697.wav|we're really enjoying it and uh
data/001392.wav|when i disconnected him does it
data/030052.wav|because that was proven untrue that was actually not a good test they did not have
data/016889.wav|what i'm saying if you have a
data/029176.wav|that's what that's what it was in comparative size with this new system each command would be counted as a vote for what the next move should be and every 10 or so seconds the program
data/005009.wav|and he's rich man on earth
data/007365.wav|well are feeling similar feeling very very similar
data/024214.wav|what the movies did it for his resume he did get some exposure i
data/023190.wav|they'll make up these phrases that have no enforcement the
data/002345.wav|i have class in four hours i might as
data/017756.wav|success without spending money on advertising um and and you can
data/014825.wav|as that nobody's buying them okay oh that's tough that's tough
data/010927.wav|we get 16 free meals from hellofresh
data/029535.wav|with the game all day all day before he goes
data/004090.wav|no i'm not going to take my lunch break
data/019351.wav|it was my favorite moment in all of college and that's sad to say because
data/027910.wav|generally it's elevated prices due to a couple reasons that we'll see how they
data/008117.wav|psychic actually decided that he's going to take the amount of subs that you owe
data/021096.wav|you can enjoy them all year long it's just
data/002164.wav|so that your ass is covered
data/015921.wav|they have to keep adding great shows to keep that listen you drop a squid game you can raise prices that's that's basically
data/019545.wav|yeah that's all i can do
data/022694.wav|in dollars this year that was
data/030490.wav|and now it's like okay we've been here for
data/013877.wav|every one of their games is player base up
data/019860.wav|second one done huge numbers the
data/006857.wav|we'd never i would never did i could barely swear to god just doing that phone stream with them who'd at at support would never i would never do i could barely swear to god just
data/031295.wav|i'm feeling like oh my god i'm
data/025523.wav|i don't believe that speaking of that actually on the same not even just a similar
data/003352.wav|the things like phones i'm sure you're seeing similar things with credit cards with car loans and
data/004864.wav|in the office for 40 hours
data/009731.wav|speak for yourself uh nail polish
data/023036.wav|especially in recent years has been very very very lacks about any
data/024290.wav|especially at the end it seems a little on the nose or not subtle enough to have them say and they
data/019526.wav|and also when i think about it i don't trust chat i think they didn't like it because they don't know it
data/002529.wav|your favor mathematically but do you have what it takes to push it one more time
data/026209.wav|i was using earbuds of and then i have one more thing to talk about i like to end the
data/019675.wav|you know i was like you know what let me do
data/023566.wav|if you have different preferences okay what's especially amazing about digital goods is the cost is almost nothing the cost is so far down here so if they can price it like at 20 bucks
data/026544.wav|but why are they doing that why is this
data/009578.wav|okay gold lead yeah it's it's well
data/002250.wav|it's my dad he's professor of business
data/029141.wav|and uh pokemon red first came out
data/005025.wav|at or for crypto shills okay because right
data/014907.wav|the pipeline has run dry they finally got him with a 10 million dollar fine
data/016007.wav|but with amazon they were like we'll be
data/014417.wav|for the nuclear bombs and that's where i
data/031740.wav|disney was okay disney's trying to get and get their hands on everything the name
data/002721.wav|what is happening it's broken i never lose these shows the whole point is
data/022748.wav|they went to samsung and lg and begged them to make their phones for them and
data/029746.wav|at the strings he decides who he
data/016702.wav|the to work but as the rising rents and rising costs for people to live farther and farther from where they work
data/021756.wav|and my bottom lane just insult every factor of their being
data/004668.wav|with the four months hello big a did you see the
data/008698.wav|what number and also he has to prove not only
data/005720.wav|there's no there's no avoiding it he and they were talking about like the
data/003818.wav|about it too it's tough i think i think
data/010578.wav|the come back in instantly he's like at the door
data/005113.wav|hello hello hello now that pride month is over can we have ally month to commemorate big a's contribution
data/021501.wav|but they can't wait that's why the timing is
data/029930.wav|with the matters this is a great set holy moly it's a great set yeah this is one of those recent
data/010406.wav|well the free market it's the opposite of the free market it's a
data/014902.wav|and art of animal crossing at least this time it feels like they're
data/021631.wav|people don't share my concern for their well-being now this one's interesting the doritos
data/021283.wav|version of drops but this picture's from
data/000392.wav|so germa shows up and wants to talk
data/006153.wav|and then like you can even see
data/022756.wav|in the late 90s at the height of the
data/013698.wav|they got a twitter old head please please please can we get somebody new in here
data/027833.wav|the burning cash so if you're ever looking at a balance sheet probably the most important thing to take a look at every time is free cash flow if you see a company that has positive free cash flow
data/021325.wav|the predictions i want to say for this last part
data/020854.wav|what does that tell you it's not about the learning though it's about growing and learning on circles and ideas
data/031559.wav|in a tightly cramped space and
data/021690.wav|i think it's pretty good stanz hates it
data/031465.wav|continues to grow maybe i could try something like this in
data/019202.wav|because it was like the little kids one like the
data/010872.wav|who really believes that stuff you know like every time they get
data/017721.wav|way of configuring the camera or extra cameras or whatever so everyone knows that you spent money on the new one
data/023359.wav|all of us gamers until one side pulls ahead and then it's
data/003903.wav|if the from just continuing to run
data/022932.wav|if you're wondering how they can talk to sony like this
data/022904.wav|was twice tim sweeney stood up on stage and delivered this quote in a ninja headband passionately
data/020806.wav|i don't get cancelled let's get to it
data/002067.wav|go all in on christianity yeah exactly
data/017954.wav|there were so far ahead of the game and it led a massive share price increases dominoes dominated online ordering for the twenty tons and it was of there were so far ahead of the game and it led to massive share price increases domino's dominated online ordering for
data/012391.wav|i know this was coming but
data/002221.wav|that's probably not the right question something like that it was gary from chicago that's correct yeah
data/019842.wav|they used all their fallout fan credit
data/015694.wav|as i know a lot that i couldn't fit into this
data/030194.wav|he got like i fell backwards
data/013502.wav|and everyone else that's also true you know what maybe they should do that you know maybe there's some positive in this i think often a lot of aggression towards other people comes from a lot of negative
data/024805.wav|to open the air to clear the air i am 100
data/031393.wav|and listen listen i mean stanz did quit
data/012520.wav|my takeaway is if you really got into it like if you showed up in set in costume
data/000107.wav|i thought about it i thought about it and i
data/023435.wav|well i didn't do it either so i don't know
data/025565.wav|so and based on my experience with metroid i don't think we're
data/028147.wav|it that a company that doesn't even make that much money and then loses all of it and more is not a billion dollar business that everyone wants to buy stock in it's not
data/031829.wav|you're joking oh my god what
data/013830.wav|they had to do something dumb they're
data/003023.wav|when we search for amc norwalk which is but it's like so
data/030706.wav|which should the south american content that's got to
data/031153.wav|i think millions after the brand deals and the you know it's a millionaire and then the thing that bothered me
data/028946.wav|so i had a great time in the school and i also had a great time doing
data/022227.wav|goofing around walking along you know a
data/023934.wav|media marketing is little nas x with his new free
data/018796.wav|it is an iconic ad of the time in modern
data/004619.wav|did you pay the bonus subscriber birthday fee i'm sure you did but i just want to
data/009755.wav|insane and then so it's nicholas cage
data/001229.wav|and it's a hard nut to crack for advertisers and marketers and and if you understand it and can make something good on it
data/023677.wav|which is which is just weird i hate brand personas i don't want to hear how and i
data/018245.wav|you precocious kid he just there's a
data/008190.wav|no of course not i just wore a minion shirt talked about minions promoted the minions movie talked about the same talking points all day because i love it
data/022961.wav|and then this is what they made off
data/006887.wav|free food three times a day giant wall of every drink you could
data/001798.wav|i really respect he's a long time journalist in
data/002022.wav|we're making a big point yeah that's what i said yes we are in agreement
data/022043.wav|you going have your own i just really doubt that the person that posted this and
data/005421.wav|we'll talk about that in a bit and one thing i i have really internalized from some of these younger
data/007918.wav|why did you say boomer that
data/002917.wav|it's gonna be interesting how that plays out especially in the light of let's just take a quick
data/011315.wav|twelve grand magically disappears when you said
data/015416.wav|and so they're kind of upset about it so it's
data/022108.wav|adidas jerseys that say terrible things about the holocaust
data/021037.wav|the competition for a fan submitted ad and this was one
data/028710.wav|i go around i write articles
data/010421.wav|the opposite i said the opposite but i
data/002056.wav|i don't want to date someone who
data/019386.wav|okay we were a total domination of the marketplace i
data/011237.wav|we're in the background i understand it i get it i
data/011784.wav|like what is this going to be
data/025694.wav|well he was overruled or fired i don't have
data/029154.wav|the battery dies i've saved hundreds times to be sure
data/027772.wav|to reject Elon musk's offer says
data/013821.wav|charts graphs and and numbers it's so depressing i i would fought in
data/001197.wav|one quick yeah but they're not as healthy that's the thing
data/023171.wav|heat in its life but that is a frozen
data/027636.wav|the money to acquire where did
data/030186.wav|but then there was a big one that had the beginning to it was a giant rope climb like like this part but way taller and a rope climb up
data/002614.wav|did you i need you to pull through on this one now please give me
data/015112.wav|i have ever seen this guy went on to become
data/017751.wav|efficient ways to do it but this kind of ways have
data/020753.wav|and what do we do we turn to instagram when facebook is torn the world apart we got a celebrities on instagram later this year a lawsuit filed by over forty u s states by the and what do we do we turn to instagram when facebook has torn the world apart we go to celebrities on instagram
data/020385.wav|being marketed till you feel like you're in on
data/024250.wav|really making a difference their company or brand or products or anything with it at all and that that's a lot of money to spend
data/016256.wav|and i strolled i strolled from today all the
data/020836.wav|if the motivated i want to
data/023500.wav|in the modern day economy are using the
data/006631.wav|i think luca had more points than all of the
data/000733.wav|like the craziest for big for like
data/030747.wav|congrats ten new members of the
data/025431.wav|did i miss anything also an hrough
data/000532.wav|his birthday party falling through uh
data/027741.wav|are now I do now I
data/009912.wav|generous and kind it was like if that's our hope if we're
data/009122.wav|ever dumber comments sorry those were me those were all you
data/023198.wav|publicly stated that it will not it will it was innocent
data/006494.wav|i do i don't like this
data/024189.wav|i think that might be it for wins
data/024767.wav|is when you first get into the game they will give you some kind of bonus
data/005456.wav|i can just look at a couple
data/011476.wav|and i think processing through it is good for you if you end up in the right spot i guess if you if you end up
data/004740.wav|and it started again three months ago with this this is a tweet that seems like all good things everything was going up
data/011787.wav|i didn't move or it was a car i don't actually know exactly the logistics of it but i
data/026417.wav|well better about it so they're just stuck in this mindset and it's one of the most inexpensive and inefficient ways to do it but this kind of ways
data/009411.wav|during his own top lane climb
data/016581.wav|and works like three days a week working in
data/000159.wav|going to have a simple time
data/013164.wav|well that pretty fun bosses you
data/021849.wav|but from a long-term point of view focusing more on the business than on
data/027187.wav|there's no disputing that so let's go uh
data/005174.wav|did it cost per nail it's for a video
data/028726.wav|well center and i'm like oh okay cool cool cool cool
data/024198.wav|well he hurt us or do we just lose a couple of his
data/021350.wav|so that was what i said
data/001886.wav|to become profitable amazon is pushing them
data/025502.wav|it's so obviously fraudulent the guy has
data/025226.wav|the party where they baked him a cake
data/018119.wav|you can tell your kids that you were here this is a real game people bought this game
data/005714.wav|on grass at a mall and we're
data/018197.wav|our dealership and you don't know how to say hyundai you won't even you won't
data/003158.wav|was using that to create basically
data/002231.wav|we're going to launch the new facebook feed pulse that allows streamers
data/020482.wav|and sold amazingly so why is the stock plummeted that's what i want to get into cd projekt red has made a lot of games in the past okay this is not their first rodeo with cdp with was our punk they've made the what you all know and love the witcher three this is the game that really gotten their claim to fame but they've made a lot more than that okay and sold amazingly so why is the stock plummeting that's what i want to get into cd projekt red has made a lot of games in the past okay this is not their first rodeo with cd
data/002178.wav|for all five people in the interview and i got the job okay so i don't regret it one bit
data/031455.wav|his head and we lost it
data/010017.wav|i thought it was uh completely ineffective
data/031557.wav|but he clears it a super entrenched
data/013908.wav|and it was tough to get the full audio experience you know and for sound so we hooked that up to
data/011665.wav|so we booked the flight and
data/008060.wav|i'll do it myself the joke's on me
data/014945.wav|well if you don't use an accountant
data/004806.wav|he's agreed to buy it so what
data/029497.wav|brett there might not even be bread under
data/018076.wav|the pepsi yes they do not make gamers like this anymore
data/008973.wav|by the company they can't change the company okay so like you know if i agree to buy your car and in writing i say i'm gonna buy it as is no matter what but you can't
data/005255.wav|well the thing is nobody else in his group
data/009267.wav|inauthentic and then they had people like doing like a chat poll they were like well you
data/024826.wav|i like if you're a new whale to a game there
data/002854.wav|your courts in america because unlike working for regular people it works for
data/031002.wav|was like wow that's that's insane
data/029185.wav|but i was definitely a start nine spammer
data/005806.wav|i have ever since because as a friend as a person
data/028177.wav|what exactly is going on but at least they got snoop
data/025952.wav|treating their talent better and and then exploitation on the
data/008623.wav|i really like twitter especially as a management
data/026299.wav|or example but gap has stood out from its peers in places like malls which are all dying in general by a better
data/015188.wav|i mean at this rate we're
data/002650.wav|love marketing monday smiley face it looks like this if you
data/031538.wav|just stop him from mining that's what his plan was and flash
data/021796.wav|has lived in kansas kansas ain't in the middle of red and
data/016559.wav|and so we have to adapt to it there will be benefits and there could be
data/000683.wav|i just got cherry blossoms in there it's really
data/014425.wav|is that we've seen the history of the internet that when new media formats come out usually only one company wins okay for images it's instagram for short form videos
data/018686.wav|confusing and stupid especially i mean look
data/025993.wav|are part of a campaign called wet january because apparently it's popular for people who have alcoholism or drink too much to try a dry january to give it up
data/019537.wav|if the care you got a better functioning government but you haven't figured out marketing
data/016355.wav|at the number one on our all of reddit and
data/029826.wav|it's so good and in my mind when he said that
data/007017.wav|i have there and he came back later and gave me some sour candy so
data/026033.wav|employees first of all given the fact they have very high churn which is like people that join and then quit so it's one of the largest hirings in one year it is the largest hiring of one year of any company in history uh the closest is
data/011375.wav|it's simple message you don't gotta say oh
data/003232.wav|as two years was yeah it was a lie
data/030534.wav|at one point we were all walking
data/007350.wav|is that was promised and i was like jmuk
data/014951.wav|for help but if you are like me and
data/015563.wav|i asked him to get me the roku intro
data/030625.wav|that got me reading war was my and sixty four getting fry i'm actually just piecing together like i i that got me reading more was my n64 getting fried i'm actually
data/006312.wav|sided with him an insane way on
data/031486.wav|and this is not a knock compared to koreans he is trash
data/007534.wav|i bought it makes you want to vomit
data/016239.wav|into the wins and fails uh let's
data/010041.wav|i mean you could see the beginning we'll
data/015615.wav|the jungle and dominates anything in
data/029776.wav|what am i doing over here i'm just
data/005845.wav|so really funny clip and but i i referenced it as a joke to
data/014606.wav|that switching will give him money to do things like a huge tournament are they really paying him that much more or is the money
data/019567.wav|my name is michael levine i'm a composer and songwriter they had a campaign they already loved and they just needed a throwaway
data/030791.wav|what a woodwind instrument is it's one of the dumbest bars ever
data/022057.wav|taking a look at what the hashtag is for sometimes they know what it's about and they don't care like in the example here kenneth cole here fashion brand did know what hashtag cairo
data/020739.wav|instead of saying anything real there was a lot of bad ads plus there's the entire nation of canada who churn out bad ads with
data/007239.wav|if the them off his game and he wants to be
data/015773.wav|it's not going to last you know hulu might stick around as like a place to hold stuff but eventually all of its
data/013865.wav|as they want to do it's relatively smart and it's what they're going to do and they're definitely not
data/026289.wav|it's all relied around this they did not care about this or this it really relied on create a sticky compelling advertisement and then the rest
data/013833.wav|who you don't know anyone there you are not a shareholder
data/023148.wav|author entrepreneur crypto investor and relatable
data/020684.wav|is year they spent almost nothing on marketing i guess because i had not heard of it a tiny company based in poland named cd something literally no i never
data/001419.wav|not google it can i get a scout
data/031741.wav|starting to shorten the new name
data/014702.wav|to the the good stuff um let me
data/016187.wav|pretty monday and i like that as opposed to the rest of them which are never interesting
data/023991.wav|on thursday there's been some outside investors get reported so investors are
data/010307.wav|and then he feels pressured a
data/001291.wav|they don't even have any ideas they just
data/032235.wav|hundreds of dollars out of the casino walking over to the table he drops all of this on the table they take it they give him
data/003263.wav|let's check it out i'm writing a book maybe you can invest
data/025184.wav|i was thinking this would be a really nice
data/023996.wav|all the adult content is gonna
data/019880.wav|so excited like oh my god it's going to be a true turn to form the game i love but of course
data/004244.wav|against my advice very smart very smart
data/023917.wav|i will get so hyped watching like football right and i i first felt it when i watched mango in tournament when i was
data/005866.wav|well he was either we just met for the first
data/001323.wav|red roof yeah i believe this was not
data/024270.wav|this is an iconic role and now you're just like doing do you take the red key or the blue key for great luxury
data/003147.wav|and it seems to be now it's not having as an immediate impact on metastock because
data/022625.wav|and what's funny is none of my co-workers believed
data/022766.wav|was maybe a scammer but he did not think that radio on the internet was smart because the second he got his yahoo stock the second he sold all of it that he could and the stuff he couldn't sell he made a bet
data/001783.wav|so much better that really blew it out of the water
data/015579.wav|started going outside again but roku kept shooting up roku has continued to grow because roku offers a really easy way
data/027757.wav|we decided to move the global
data/005901.wav|actual he made me say this obviously obviously i wouldn't say this
data/013525.wav|it's tough enough as it is
data/025869.wav|give them feedback for free and they thought they would just be honored to try a new blizzard game and that is like a that is
data/030846.wav|it's kind of legendary people talk about it
data/028170.wav|a year more than there's three times more
data/026482.wav|if they bought this book at auction with this plan to make the book public to produce an original animated series inspired by the book and sell it to a streaming service and to support derivative projects from the community
data/011319.wav|last time i played fall guys with you was
data/021131.wav|we can never make something that's not dated so let's lean into it
data/017563.wav|three billion verizon 3 billion verizon a
data/007807.wav|here's the deal i have a question for you so i have a wins and fails
data/012942.wav|i just felt like i was disconnected from the real decision making and like so at nvidia i felt way closer to it i
data/029630.wav|as got a really sad vibe so kind of lines up i i
data/018542.wav|is a service to sell toilet paper it's a service to make you hooked into amazon prime so
data/002129.wav|and there's no shot this doesn't get a
data/021747.wav|what i think it's a big waste jimmy john's now by the way if
data/000177.wav|about the bachelor party though is i
data/015211.wav|new path forward number of languages supported netflix
data/016944.wav|itself before accepting sponsorship they also
data/002408.wav|if the language hold the country
data/013438.wav|yeah i mean this is funny
data/015254.wav|netflix is being considered by customers as like
data/017104.wav|that would be a wild one that would get me that would give me pause
data/022163.wav|it's a good ad i mean it's it's a good way of
data/008365.wav|codified system but it is not one person being greedy that is correct it's not like
data/019323.wav|it was like a gigantic flop these are all
data/018116.wav|which project before you got the smash bros
data/010066.wav|it too boring but number three and most importantly at the end of the video we have to have learned something can't be pure entertainment
data/018715.wav|and so they made a judgment call they said
data/017512.wav|i will ban every single one of you who talks anything about the real names of people at my work literally every single one of
data/000596.wav|and i think okay that sucks because i'm
data/021884.wav|it's talent agencies in hollywood and it's this woman's
data/005229.wav|i get there and it's kind of insane it's like this brand new sofa stadium in
data/027324.wav|is scarcity and as we've talked about
data/023499.wav|if everyone's got a ferrari then you're not going to pay a huge amount of money for it this is the strategy behind things like drops exclusive sneakers
data/001730.wav|there's like everyone's like having just
data/027642.wav|it all comes out to they're
data/009144.wav|the right to any discovery and buy a
data/016794.wav|people living on dollars per day is decreasing
data/019033.wav|you need she also talks about you know before
data/002813.wav|of google ceo sergey brin who is now filing for divorce uh now he did
data/026938.wav|that are all buying hounds right now this is
data/019827.wav|it's a great video called the in goodening of
data/015380.wav|above their weight class basically hbo
data/003372.wav|the guys don't know magnus carlsen basically dropped out of the world chess championship basically saying he no longer wants to compete at the highest level for chess he's done he's won for
data/027857.wav|the outflows which there is and so these
data/002809.wav|it's who had that happen too
data/010040.wav|it is funny it's very jake
data/028431.wav|at my bars were fire but uh my relationship with my parents
data/018737.wav|it was just better on the inside it was you couldn't tell the difference between that one and the previous one
data/000429.wav|and ludwig's joining me everyone else
data/014024.wav|let me get a song oh you know what i got
data/032381.wav|when i read his comment i actually hit
data/008821.wav|it gets out of this whole twitter thing
data/031907.wav|but it's not i don't know how else to describe it if anything it was embarrassed you took
data/014915.wav|moving here so let me give you the final final win and this is a major one this is
data/000149.wav|if the people that want to show up
data/025195.wav|like brand to even think this would be funny
data/021857.wav|is the reason this all started to spike i'd like to point something out to you though this is whenever
data/022575.wav|if they banned dream for a day i
data/004834.wav|you unlock child care benefits congratulations this is big it's a big
data/004901.wav|the cap it there we cap
data/027408.wav|we're in mind and so the government started to develop
data/011002.wav|oh yeah you mentioned there's no boss oh god
data/026674.wav|like what they were what who had the power here the power was with twitch this guy had just promised all of these investors that the overwatch league was
data/025210.wav|so that's a fail but i'm sure come on
data/024553.wav|it says go to web go to safari and you can you can can it be a link so that's the
data/007341.wav|the and that's that was a story but anyway after every sick combo that j mooc would do aidan would one over to my my the and that's that was the story but anyway after every sick combo that mook would
data/030794.wav|in the gut while i'm wiping my butt
data/007158.wav|just because then people get you know tuned out to things that i think are bigger
data/013900.wav|i'll say it i'll say it and
data/025886.wav|in response i i think the best way to explain this actually i want to explain
data/015371.wav|what half a billion dollars for each emmy that means to get high quality content amazon has to spend
data/013070.wav|he directed the animation for jimmy neutron that's sick
data/028475.wav|if the heated as i have seen i can relate dude by the way i could relate with
data/029408.wav|nervous and like this needs to be quick i was like mom no
data/010316.wav|we're still on the morbius tour
data/026419.wav|it requires money to buy and so i've done a
data/001300.wav|and if i did you know what
data/027446.wav|in meetings with her team and like bouncing ideas and then paying and then she writes the
data/015993.wav|our directors actors producers movies filming years of time and i get 50 i
data/005812.wav|it's for that but i didn't want it to be like okay let's just talk about this for forever i wouldn't have a chance and by the way i think he has that chance and think he's actually done some funny stuff recently he did the casting of the it's the for that but i didn't want it to be like okay let's just talk about this for forever i want another chance and by the
data/012225.wav|and so i go all in i look i look this
data/020874.wav|well there's a fire the problem is insurance companies
data/025482.wav|it's a really brilliant business idea if this gets popular it could be quite a
data/009235.wav|could to my ankle yeah it just
data/008834.wav|the oh yeah you want back out of
data/020939.wav|it's just not probable and it shouldn't be what you bank on the media tells you the stories of the overnight successes but that's all
data/010587.wav|in chats and they did this and then i asked the question everyone in chat said they did this and then i asked
data/016434.wav|not saying there's an easy solution i'm
data/024320.wav|if the country and it's a super bowl ad you're selling these cars across the country if not globally and you spend half the ad like kind of insulting other cities and
data/025808.wav|generally most people would agree riot games was why even have the
data/013371.wav|some terrible tweets and some great ones and
data/007950.wav|what makes you so awesome is it perhaps your
data/018378.wav|we're like workers owning the product ever now only fans still big corporation
data/003463.wav|which is like that's why it's so it's so important and strategic and interesting
data/026963.wav|probably while alone we are meta that is literally the concept for this incredibly strange
data/015152.wav|if the growing their way out of the debt through pure content and
data/004713.wav|where's dancing in the blue light though i told i told
data/000625.wav|one of the nights i was thinking like
data/020045.wav|that the government would even let it through because it gave google such a
data/012052.wav|is if there wasn't enough lightsabers
data/012033.wav|and he just tells you what to do
data/015060.wav|worth so they got friends on netflix friends
data/002975.wav|this monster appears is right in front of the camera and then the power goes out
data/029124.wav|at the twitch chat and announced that that had become an official
data/009307.wav|it's so colorful good point you should be a
data/022107.wav|what an example is that these are
data/026658.wav|sign up real quick you get a free share of something it also has a social feed where you can follow people's accounts and any of their public trades you want to follow you can find my account and you can follow my trades so check it out public it's in the link below
data/018530.wav|with some kind of way to make money in the in the back end or
data/009499.wav|because we were champion yasuo god's favorite champion yasuo got his favorite
data/018146.wav|and pepsi city dude this is the finale the finale
data/011029.wav|put my face on a statue
data/026883.wav|process it it moves too much it's
data/014385.wav|is no other reason so these
data/019326.wav|they call themselves pear tech how
data/011536.wav|but as i look out among the sea of
data/007105.wav|determined primarily by an algorithm then when you express a small amount of interest that can snowball to
data/024351.wav|that was pretty good let's see if this one matches up this is a guinness ad called
data/020055.wav|yeah man yeah man that aged well
data/031064.wav|i was like oh this is not what i expected and he was like really outgoing you know we were hanging out at a melee tournament and he i had a job i had
data/009939.wav|like it is it is worthy of laughing at because it is it is cringe
data/031678.wav|and then ever since then i played more league
data/018128.wav|in computer of pepsi city went out of
data/001334.wav|pretty banana and now it's just me and my pal
data/005247.wav|well in front of me and he looks at me and he goes
data/000352.wav|wait killer queen game is that what
data/031167.wav|you know someone more greedy could
data/008355.wav|turns out he a little wobbly on that thing so things might change it might turn out to be like a situation where
data/027899.wav|we're going to play a little balloon later tonight
data/025543.wav|i want to give a personal shout out to
data/020144.wav|yeah that's a funny that's funny it's right
data/016597.wav|these guys were not particularly genius okay they're not the the greatest
data/024720.wav|in their life getting stocks and bonds and houses can stay rich that is basically what's happening you kind of want some correction at some
data/018214.wav|a three i think that's a little generous i would put this at a one or
data/014731.wav|hassan you need you need to do more
data/030225.wav|he won that race when he pissed himself
data/025752.wav|on their top-notch tires pretty quickly there's something there he's able to reverse on the snow really
data/015953.wav|you're like i can't live without it that's why they do it they do it because the more you watch netflix the
data/016025.wav|if the for two hours i'm pretty tired i'm glad we
data/000504.wav|and then i pass out and then i pass out
data/024125.wav|was about this i needed to bring this up
data/024539.wav|track the agreements of of apple to developers is that
data/024984.wav|it's a crazy kind of powerful of germany to stand up to amazon amazon is actually in america the number
data/025609.wav|we're going to count facebook as meta then
data/025625.wav|there who falls into a category of gamers that i like to call the best kind
data/020997.wav|monkey business sales aren't up there they're down
data/020277.wav|it's been like okay we have boring weird ads and we're

data/023091.wav|directly influences how you rate it how you think it tasted so this is
data/014368.wav|one of the smartest things which has ever done when valorent launched they focused all of
data/013552.wav|what my chat okay that's good
data/020130.wav|back and forth of burger king and
data/013143.wav|would i think of the rain it's

data/012687.wav|well comes out how many of you are arcane viewers
data/009387.wav|it's like a two percent gain but you
data/030866.wav|actually be dope because then i
data/000296.wav|at the to learn he tried to learn for a video and then
data/021316.wav|a single individual people have the power of
data/025322.wav|boys and so my fail goes to blizzard because
data/018678.wav|the end of the console generation but overall it was a tie then came the reckoning and that is the generation where the
data/018247.wav|six the first six it's the greatest
data/015031.wav|and they'll send you another movie from your list
data/022424.wav|we use a lot of the same kinds of programs
data/025289.wav|v series are you like an among us fan like i'm

data/000293.wav|i got out the for a bit is that ludwig won't stop trying to play piano the whole time reviving in the sweet i got out there for a bit is that ludwig won't stop trying to play piano
data/027921.wav|the market route weekly sales down 64
data/031490.wav|if the game that hard there are people in korea who lived in team houses and played starcraft every day of their lives for their entire youth only to be called a b teamer and get cut
data/014980.wav|what does coming out on top even mean
data/002952.wav|never spent this much on a movie and it's it i
data/022332.wav|years later when developing a campaign for nvidia i took the ideas that i liked about it
data/027928.wav|and beloved members of the cameo family
data/022156.wav|it kicked off a new trend of
data/023297.wav|that being said this is a complete non-starter this story is dead
data/018770.wav|well that's their big that's their big thing so let's pull up the
data/013666.wav|name of the platform from mixer to atriac
data/028655.wav|i find this shirt i say this is perfect and i buy it immediately okay i don't know why they're like okay okay
data/024896.wav|the basic monkey brain that we use for most
data/013452.wav|i didn't get it because i've never ran afoul of the law
data/007079.wav|i didn't want to come off
data/019826.wav|the lying that's what they did but in the interim sense if you've ever watched
data/021098.wav|in solve it airlines suck yeah that's relatable
data/010143.wav|what a circle and sat down the whole time
data/017347.wav|jeff bezos can bring me back to work over my cold dead body this is fake unless he invites me to whatever party he was at for this photo
data/020703.wav|just a picture of a disgusting moldy
data/004711.wav|i walked in on ari listening to the full album today and she was jamming to dancing in the balloon light so end of the day that's a queen uh i'm putting on right now it'll just
data/017372.wav|thank god they finally got a dub for once the marvel cinematic universe if anyone needed a
data/028251.wav|you basically need a lot of fives fives and
data/018189.wav|i'm not even showing on screen how
data/028395.wav|and what that means in buzzword
data/015857.wav|they're trying to fight that stuff as well they want
data/028694.wav|if the the costco in colorado and i thought about
data/017957.wav|it's up with what's up what's up
data/005990.wav|in people that are such casual watchers and just
data/017145.wav|in dealing okay it's a co-worker relationship only
data/004173.wav|the plan figure out the plan seamlessly how
data/025687.wav|a useless and they really doubled down on these ads for
data/028372.wav|executives will sit across from each other and say the word net back and
data/024985.wav|one most loved brand there's a score called the nps which is your net promoter score which means you're how
data/007469.wav|it's just like one of the weirdest restaurants
data/002393.wav|if the play it for many many many hours and i'd rather just jump in so i can do
data/015889.wav|with marketing from the harvard of the southwest arizona state
data/015352.wav|i have the money to pay their way out of
data/012985.wav|as level of a bunch of different subjects is like the wackest way to do school
data/019405.wav|we like won by a lot and so like now
data/012954.wav|i feel like you should have something in mind you should be kind of committed grad
data/026580.wav|always phone call phone call can you imagine if ninja called pokey
data/008363.wav|way more systematic yeah i mean true technically it is not
data/005354.wav|golden blunt and probably made i mean i was i
data/024037.wav|but my honest opinion is that their goal was just to say something so they
data/028392.wav|so far from our true north here
data/003444.wav|we're not interesting it's so important is that
data/020166.wav|the hard enough without the marketing trend of the day being insulted by every company we buy from you know is gucci just
data/000620.wav|at the my life it was so cool that all my old
data/029360.wav|and so everybody's ordering like all
data/010537.wav|a real glue girl really because like you bring
data/030207.wav|and then he started losing pokemon gen
data/003433.wav|don't exactly how it works but the basically the big communist
data/029848.wav|a long time in a youtube video and it's
data/008492.wav|what does that mean how does that solve our problem
data/031402.wav|a budget like we just get the chill in the
data/030488.wav|at the time it's a great night appetizer comes
data/008028.wav|this game doesn't have those as much
data/015716.wav|feels like it's authentic and and i don't feel like i have to
data/032359.wav|much into this there's like nine paragraphs
data/022870.wav|versus epic lawsuit kicked off today tim sweeney versus tim
data/020746.wav|not only a terrible message but it secretly predicts facebook's plan for ruining america look here's a scientist trying to say something important to a class of students americans
data/008064.wav|you are abusing the fact that i know you and you're saying it's really important but it's not going to be important at all and in fact it's
data/009149.wav|with such vigor is it just because he says he likes rick
data/019173.wav|we're looking at are not really among the greats so we're
data/017118.wav|here to tell you it's no longer your nickname
data/016486.wav|he came across the fact that the
data/011644.wav|no it's like it's only two days and it's out a little over five thousand dollars so for two people
data/008670.wav|have apparently it'll like all i'm
data/001096.wav|it's and parties and started a club and it was fun and then at the summer break after freshman year i got into a little game called league of legends and so really freshman
data/024544.wav|help people that like you can't even hint at it you can't
data/030561.wav|ever in the entire time was able to ask
data/008335.wav|i guess i'm encouraged that people didn't just like take it lying down i
data/000297.wav|half of one song really well
data/007623.wav|you know everybody says quack bad
data/027924.wav|appreciate his perseverance right on time
data/009102.wav|you know the more pixelated the
data/009189.wav|and again that that level of i give obviously a
data/015236.wav|in the for success and that shows up with this
data/012263.wav|yeah here it is like the like in the in the in the in the previous round we were playing with
data/023271.wav|not only did she get all of them right
data/002892.wav|when he does so normally billionaires don't
data/023123.wav|especially if they have a small package they'll just
data/000601.wav|white up and then i have never been more invested in a show in my entire life
data/027129.wav|i just recorded inflation ever it's it's happening like crazy uh now
data/001645.wav|we ignore them and it just adds
data/010494.wav|i want the finishing of the season i actually
data/030687.wav|at the moment all right so by the way we made a big
data/002401.wav|i don't understand whenever you say i'm east east coast
data/003015.wav|it's like my legs are jelly dude like it was
data/001659.wav|women should be valued and treated right you know
data/005083.wav|not a slow typer i'm a fast sniper actually
data/000006.wav|coffee cow did some no no no no no no no that being said okay that's a terrible story to start with
data/021223.wav|and you can have peacock regular
data/029414.wav|it'd be like oh i'm sorry sir that this didn't work and i would have to
data/029224.wav|and port job i'm like yes there are and important job i'm like yes dude an important job an
data/011656.wav|why the week but it was not
data/019765.wav|it's always better than under hype
data/004820.wav|it's funny because yesterday he also began a really
data/019859.wav|of matrix mania the matrix sequels had done huge
data/007891.wav|and where he said yep coke now normally i think all yep cup messages are stupid but maybe
data/027418.wav|someone made this post uh clicking
data/017800.wav|and subs even though his stream would not change in quality i think the
data/028758.wav|in downtown san francisco which is essentially poverty wages and i not only did i not negotiate
data/002853.wav|the contract law it's one of the speedier
data/024356.wav|and when you see it in higher quality it's even more
data/014134.wav|is it my tabs problem yeah here
data/015987.wav|in it position and make money it's not good
data/031967.wav|of all time he's a former twitch
data/010724.wav|it's out of the irs's hands yet thankfully thank god not in the hands of the editors this
data/025848.wav|bad result secondly and this is a major one how both companies have responded to the rise of influencers in the past let's
data/011364.wav|because that has connotations that i think you know you can say let's go
data/003753.wav|we just do it without any consequence there's no
data/032300.wav|trillionaire grind set this is what i
data/028186.wav|i smash fan you don't know anything about
data/015850.wav|we had a good run we had a good run
data/019191.wav|copies when two companies are going
data/028398.wav|my entire life if you write as per my last email you are in corporate america saying i want to fight you you are my open enemy if you write as for my last email you're saying
data/005236.wav|of her friends because they were
data/027834.wav|that means not in parentheses you're looking at a company that at the very least makes sense it's it's like what
data/023869.wav|this is a dub there's no
data/026083.wav|somebody had put an image of jake hurwitz from college humor it's just one of the images and because it looks similar enough the people writing just
data/008983.wav|like a prime bonus on prime day i feel like everyone should get a second prime on prime day or something there should be some sort of prime oh there is
data/031903.wav|i was like take a breath new plan going forward
data/017576.wav|can be anything from a service or a product or a good
data/017463.wav|but the kellogg strike is not only the strikers
data/022458.wav|it was literally me trying to think of what is a gaming version of just do it i was just i'm so obsessed with how nike approaches marketing but i'm
data/022276.wav|super bowl ad bad big waste of
data/010331.wav|the rock yes that would be good michael reeves i tried to get i don't think
data/015113.wav|you have netflix by the way he was a content
data/009401.wav|i have to tell him that in an ezreal
data/003090.wav|i'm just gonna put this right here okay hey here's a
data/023809.wav|nothing just the late night filings
data/004523.wav|if you love that that's actually really smart a little knowledge with the relationship always
data/016438.wav|to like a real world one of satan's demons okay and if i had to pick of all the jobs in the world who was most likely to be one of the real world satans demons it
data/028409.wav|what that means is it did not go well and i don't want you to talk about
data/024372.wav|about the film by chanel let's watch the film and again all of us in chat
data/006872.wav|the twitch so i could get the full set
data/022722.wav|so acting with the speed that you can tell
data/000533.wav|we we i i found these watches last time we were in vegas that were the four seasons
data/020191.wav|is pushing something rather take that brand hey fellow gen
data/003855.wav|let him off the hook but this inflation
data/021188.wav|the average money as you'll see in
data/032098.wav|the name ron which is apparently
data/024298.wav|i had a lot of viewers today
data/019990.wav|after heroes you don't even own yet you can't use them they
data/029508.wav|i thought was actually a really
data/012070.wav|ari and he knew that she was not good so every time he would see us
data/027170.wav|an insane amount of money just
data/004768.wav|it doesn't make a lot of sense
data/001305.wav|yeah i guess yeah i guess i think what it is my theory on all content cycles
data/018331.wav|essentially so everyone can cash out on idiots on
data/020893.wav|when they're not perfectly flat on
data/022988.wav|it's not a good enough reason
data/024251.wav|it would not walk away even knowing what brand it was for microsoft missed the mark on this one so i'm
data/026865.wav|is a celebrities also three stacks his
data/028160.wav|stuff i mean they're spending on the face house
data/009833.wav|all i know is that it's wild that
data/001492.wav|what the problem with this setup well it's my game show so
data/015126.wav|yet until netflix looked at the data for for streaming so they uh so they release house of
data/003925.wav|in the stream i've been watching all the vods
data/005204.wav|if the throttle and take down my internet and so they said are you sure because we'd love to give you great quality affordable service that never has any
data/015968.wav|yeah and it's funny because during the xbox one era they were the opposite they did so many things wrong they like
data/020986.wav|and give their get their thoughts and reviews
data/020505.wav|money they're going to make on
data/024638.wav|collapsed completely they had hundreds of billions of dollars in debt due to pay today that they have defaulted on means
data/012873.wav|any games tonight i don't think so
data/008976.wav|i think there was like a recruiting executive
data/002196.wav|it pisses me off how trash
data/021160.wav|i could see wanting to give it the highest honors if you really like it
data/010881.wav|hey it's about brotherhood it's about
data/029421.wav|or something it was like yo i'm sorry i'm not sure i

data/030799.wav|it's opened up at nvidia want to start
data/027397.wav|is the beginning of a trend of people
data/024580.wav|well drawn out agreement is continuing to keep epic games and fortnite off the app store forever and so fortnite mobile remains a
data/015434.wav|for example red notice was the biggest movie on netflix this year red notice is no
data/009130.wav|i thought i'd carved out a little slice of the internet where people
data/027255.wav|well as games and this would not ring true for
data/005449.wav|he was so excited and energetic when he asked for it and this is the picture that's crazy that's wild um same
data/030681.wav|so i'm trying i'm like you know
data/018827.wav|even people who like eating meat alternatives are probably not a big fan of cardboard
data/014264.wav|at us we're actually launching the facebook
data/010994.wav|you get 16 free meals which is why it's
data/006665.wav|and that means i had to wake up 45
data/026172.wav|here because i was worried that they were going to be even in more trouble after a leak came out this week that they were shredding documents related to their abuse investigation yeah this came out but who cares about this bro overwatch mobile could be happening oh
data/026634.wav|that's also not a joke so let me show you this this is what we showed okay
data/009048.wav|updating oh it's pix thank you for the three
data/016881.wav|if he is now dead uh it is
data/004045.wav|and i just did not catch up and i woke
data/002798.wav|if the fix this problem but i haven't installed
data/014719.wav|at me was it like did he like try to look really jacked and say like really intelligent stuff or what
data/016013.wav|what the debt and fight netflix and your plan
data/005876.wav|it was a good bit it was i was funny
data/002560.wav|am i need it very very quickly you know how
data/022915.wav|this is from sony the guy from sony says sorry
data/014230.wav|they get immersed in the culture on here this
data/024716.wav|at the top and that to me is very very suspicious generally i want to give you guys recession advice if you graduate directly into a recession that's bad so if you're in college right now try to be younger somehow try to be younger okay but if you're younger usually at the
data/014241.wav|type of person that can get someone to try out streaming and that is what they need more than anything this will grow with time
data/005578.wav|if you would let that tree
data/014067.wav|i wanna talk about the whole thing let's do a quick look back at how we got here okay let's look back at how we got here starting in
data/003887.wav|what everyone's like because i think santa
data/016206.wav|what do to research being immortal god willing god willing a world without jeff i don't even want to stomach it skip the middle
data/031900.wav|you put a lot of time into this
data/030006.wav|at the day and they all come to peep off
data/017069.wav|white honest what happened to the youtube oh um quack
data/019829.wav|watch today but you should watch it um
data/011119.wav|and then when i asked you what i said you said i was dozing yeah
data/015487.wav|they're not going back to this world it's very hard to pull the leech off to stop the
data/003255.wav|this is what i've been hoping for every single thing i do should be turned into a
data/021480.wav|we're buys in later that's it routers says 70 billion was lost
data/017505.wav|it'll give you a chance to transition real
data/027657.wav|increase profitability he will find a way to make this company make a lot more money now number one way you can do that
data/031351.wav|like legit a lot of community service like a
data/003691.wav|as if and like there's no chance because that's
data/007917.wav|or boomer if i do something you like you say poggies if i do something you don't like
data/029401.wav|again i haven't planned and i call my mommy i call my mommy back in california and i
data/002537.wav|for to respond i don't know
data/013658.wav|yes emotionally it impacts more people i
data/023265.wav|how she really can taste the difference in waters
data/029569.wav|it almost feels cheesy these days when we
data/027390.wav|what's this week when on an episode of the kardashians
data/001303.wav|being a thing pranks are funny i feel like
data/015350.wav|that are freelancers if you've saved enough for your taxes do you think you have yes no or maybe now for me i've seen this a lot with streamers
data/009547.wav|that they have to ban the right champions bands are just so incredibly important in i mean bands are important in pro play
data/026314.wav|the product volume the amount of product of
data/012359.wav|whereas they play really loud like they
data/015691.wav|is the streaming wars let's go back
data/000672.wav|bear in mind we were up thousands we were up a lot of money so again not all this is like dead loss at the end of the
data/018573.wav|the gate both sides realize that it sucks
data/025750.wav|i don't know how effective that was because it really didn't show i mean i guess i
data/002347.wav|with the day an extra three hour nap does do something it doesn't do a lot but it does do something every time you push it off that's just yeah
data/001951.wav|really good marketing money like a
data/020508.wav|where they hadn't revealed very much
data/025328.wav|which component of my beloved warlock siphon
data/021371.wav|and then you sell that stock
data/025160.wav|wow and a hilarious tweet hi welcome to mcdowell's with the capital oh
data/014612.wav|i gotta keep going this strategy so think about
data/029721.wav|yeah i remember look going back and
data/021520.wav|it's doing is people are seeing at home getting traction the government cake and his fair share it's doing is people are sitting at home getting the checks from the government
data/010026.wav|it's that saved pride month which was an absolute banger that's cool love to see that
data/028976.wav|or i got the more that gummy bear started to look good to
data/011343.wav|yeah that was one of the
data/029342.wav|like wearing riot merch head to toe
data/031329.wav|and they're charging me as a crime and so i have to go before a judge and so not only that i have to have
data/022840.wav|the second the deal completes this happens let's pull it up and get rid of my black boxes it goes from this to this because this thing called broadband comes out and people don't want to pay by the hour so all of this aol
data/012136.wav|we problem was i guess they didn't expect for couples that were in the same room to have different to do different things because this this happened so you have your little droid i told you about
data/011932.wav|dude comes out he looks like this i got a
data/010157.wav|we to make sure that i'm cool that i'm
data/001608.wav|get smarter thursdays where we're going
data/027322.wav|create a sense of scarcity so for example if you look at the steam charts so if i were to pull up the steam achievements for a game like sekiro you might notice only
data/025708.wav|if the company full of clowns the whole the whole message becomes that like you have a weird scary dark restaurant full of clowns on halloween if you want a safe
data/030840.wav|one right now no i just
data/025030.wav|but it's dominoes dominoes in the united states orange julius in canada which
data/016722.wav|i literally are getting massive portions of their life and day back because of work from home and they are not
data/003153.wav|it from all different directions number one apple and their new quote unquote privacy push which essentially has been described as robbing the
data/016615.wav|this problem or doing deeper research on it because it is a
data/027103.wav|have been talking lighter news so the interviewer's like wow that's that's
data/016442.wav|there is no more checks there's no more checks there's no more
data/016353.wav|i mean that i've been talking about um
data/028798.wav|was like twelve thousand dollars maybe on a
data/030158.wav|his car was like way ahead of me and i
data/029058.wav|was my ride he drove me to the theater he's my friend he was my only way home so at this point i think i'm
data/004590.wav|i really enjoyed it had a good time
data/018192.wav|very simple problem all you remember from this ad
data/031057.wav|i remember when i first met ludwig he was an editor for scar and
data/002911.wav|really meets the road on netflix is big talk they have basically told
data/010697.wav|that's not good that's not i work retail to take
data/027745.wav|well that's the idea to do that he is following
data/022692.wav|not making any money so now you have a
data/010344.wav|does that mean what does that mean i mean
data/029495.wav|if the four slices of bread no other
data/029148.wav|four and a half hours till the end of the night i got to
data/023666.wav|in march and put three thousand dollars down and
data/006001.wav|at josh mann was like i told him this i
data/011222.wav|at jfk vaping yeah jfk jewel
data/003981.wav|let's get america's coffers full hairline empty
data/020066.wav|in huge and strong realizing that
data/005583.wav|and then all of a sudden like 30 minutes
data/031324.wav|if the school group i will i will pay i'll pay
data/022814.wav|and the magic of people getting way too excited about stocks
data/011884.wav|it's scope and scale of some of the things and like it didn't feel like i was
data/027925.wav|i want to give a third win to the lost art
data/028788.wav|and she pauses for a second there's like this very long silence it's just a few
data/005331.wav|was over a three way conversation he interrupts a points like over the three-way conversation he
data/021001.wav|it hits the their theme and is humorous so it's good i i like where you has put the smiley face with watch it is camp grocery album of the years the it it hits their theme and is humorous so it's good i i like where you guys put it it's a smiley face
data/015247.wav|was over everyone was like okay great game of thrones is over i don't need hbo max
data/021187.wav|in general most of that is owned by very old people so you might be asking why if i just told you that do i predict that it's going to be a good year for millennials the answer is boomers are starting to die if you'll notice it has started to turn
data/010774.wav|we open up your messages and
data/030129.wav|you better go pick up that microphone
data/008804.wav|we just pay that so yeah it's interesting
data/020569.wav|it's an entirely different thing okay one of them is easy to bounce back from the other one isn't
data/030144.wav|two weeks i think i said on stream like hey if you guys want other content pass
data/014187.wav|and so youtube has made a pretty smart investment here with not only getting this solid group but also getting ludwig
data/026816.wav|so facebook is looking at a very disgustingly bad next 10 years where
data/012707.wav|wait for the day if they're both losses
data/024295.wav|the cheaper it would really undercut what they were going for
data/022103.wav|and like a posts from a few days ago where you posted a nice message with a customer's name awesome and like a post from a few days ago where you posted a nice message with a
data/004886.wav|in america we live in a society that is extremely
data/024894.wav|i have ever read the book thinking fast and slow it's a great book i would recommend checking it out but the main idea
data/019926.wav|the for number one most important
data/022959.wav|rocket league plus battle breakers plus other games okay all the way up here at
data/021996.wav|i have heard women belong in the kitchen full stop end of tweet
data/031734.wav|anime characters is there a big conspiracy going on here
data/000629.wav|i was thinking through the whole thing it was like it was a real
data/020507.wav|that allowed them to turn a game where
data/027664.wav|guys remember but a while back i talked about how remember that tomato guy the guy who said the secret to getting rich is you
data/018828.wav|is so sparsely featured and the journey
data/029973.wav|yeah but why are you live for an hour talking about why you're not going to do it when you could have just done
data/024808.wav|it's not even really a gotcha mechanic yet but but again wall skins
data/030786.wav|do you mean by i'm drake
data/016610.wav|actually have a video on it
data/008113.wav|when he goes live and it'll be it'll just be really awkward if i watch all of ee stream and somehow it doesn't happen
data/023638.wav|first of all i'm pro the cause and second of all there is a benefit even if it's cringy of a lot of big
data/019447.wav|i have so many ads in
data/023575.wav|probably right up here and they priced it way down here
data/018962.wav|the show they need to be able to watch their phone
data/025660.wav|so i looked into it there was set up to where only the founder and creator of squid coin was able to sell it was so i looked into it it was set up to where only the founder and creator of
data/008668.wav|italy removing gel mails is impossible on your
data/023414.wav|after that you cheated because now that i've done it i have now become a difficulty andy so first of all there's no way you could have done it because i did it
data/020929.wav|as much more fulfilling getting good at something makes you passionate about that thing and also gives you that center that reduces anxiety so that's that's my advice on that and
data/030759.wav|i had a lot of phone calls
data/024350.wav|now our last beer ad by
data/010679.wav|chimps there's no way because i feel like everyone wants to do
data/020260.wav|it's not the right play now number three
data/000570.wav|at a plan on sunday this is cutie's idea
data/002102.wav|i just hate lands in mtg well
data/012645.wav|and maybe get smarter i told factor i would do it on thursday and
data/006509.wav|it's basically free why wouldn't you do it and it sounds good and in your mind you can always justify you can be like yeah
data/027658.wav|it's advertising you could find a way to get more advertisers to show up and use twitter possible although i think advertisers will be scared because
data/031919.wav|but there was like a step up here into like a little more private
data/032088.wav|right on that joke is when you realize that was all he got to
data/025636.wav|and just eat all your meals there every day lunch and dinner every day for years he paid off all
data/018164.wav|the victory i'd be happy okay i'm looking for
data/014680.wav|i was seven years old when what the
data/030092.wav|wait one more day maybe i don't think i could have but maybe i could have but like they were like
data/016707.wav|how long is your commute you have
data/004676.wav|that i never did it i'll scrub all the vods
data/017712.wav|the products have what i have called the flex factor which means they are very
data/024309.wav|we've actually seen before and it features one marshall mathers
data/030084.wav|it's like me and ash okay and the months go by we go through all of summer i'm getting closer and closer and closer i'm talking about it
data/026565.wav|really impressed because that's that's very rare so big big win to him big
data/003098.wav|wait let's give a win to um
data/020955.wav|if they do that it is the it is the
data/010739.wav|every other minute or they're faulty wires
data/025472.wav|but because they actually did a really good business idea and purchased keyboard company high ground
data/031203.wav|i was when we played this so i i'm very excited for all the
data/016432.wav|as a prop to fleece average people and i think that should be your main focus if you're trying to try to
data/032132.wav|will regale you with it was
data/009449.wav|if they all flew out to the
data/015234.wav|i did about for original content netflix has more than the rest of the
data/007862.wav|the camera's live we'll see what happens
data/003905.wav|if you have to run you can still run you can lose the democratic primary and run as an independent but in america that means you can't win who would be a good candidate
data/029628.wav|yeah you know directorial decisions you see
data/029070.wav|and that's what i'm saying dude let me
data/023692.wav|and the fourth option is my super sustainable bmw that's the fourth option and i guess they just assumed that everyone would pick my super sustainable
data/014889.wav|it'd be just incredibly close because they're
data/031575.wav|because the the default is that flash
data/012681.wav|a person in real life and not get banned from wow after the
data/030465.wav|and they didn't so i didn't even look at
data/032248.wav|fat stack of chips and starts betting
data/024656.wav|with the construction are also starting to fail
data/025290.wav|scrubs and psych are goaded shows what what do you think we're talking about do you think we're just listing shows that were good
data/004969.wav|the the the neural link hidden twins disclosure
data/026378.wav|if the for apple among their over over their tech
data/001926.wav|so like the balance of uh
data/002489.wav|i would absolutely backfire if every lace bag in america wrote
data/023329.wav|if you want to protect your family's interest in earnings for generations if you want your kids your grandkids and
data/002017.wav|the the biggest boba hater and
data/008444.wav|seven or eight i was on you know little league soccer i was like you know played as a kid and apparently
data/003040.wav|should i steal my amc stock
data/017317.wav|in world war two amazon is hiring people like they're
data/001383.wav|started throwing me off he's trying to throw me off he's trying
data/020895.wav|i think we intuitively know this though this is not like a game changer if you look you can find articles from five years ago saying we're five years away from
data/010015.wav|well shootings i it's in the video it's it's
data/000027.wav|i guess they'll give you a discount for making them laugh yeah coke dealers are notorious for for being easy going when the
data/023698.wav|and that always go yep they go yep yep
data/017253.wav|and then if you can't do all that without going to jail what happened to this country what if you can't do that without getting in trouble
data/004765.wav|about the liberal bias of its current employees
data/007039.wav|follow commissions but worth checking out does
data/031690.wav|and like full metal alchemist so i made up a fake anime
data/015286.wav|this is library size so if you'll notice disney plus pretty small peacock
data/025303.wav|it was like that on twitch it's
data/025274.wav|and so i was like i'm not gonna
data/004093.wav|that's that's not part of the menu
data/003132.wav|in fact i think i could segue that pretty well maybe into a
data/010627.wav|at the screen and starts going point by point like
data/030555.wav|it all together like what was going on
data/030315.wav|i had to tell heath ledger's joker and right i mean literally
data/022851.wav|he's doing now so i googled him i just
data/023838.wav|my proposal now king delroy is having
data/000307.wav|the same pattern friday night it's about even the good saturday night i make a bunch of money saturday night we're always up and then sunday night the casino always takes it back
data/014259.wav|not just those numbers okay i missed this i'm sorry i'm just
data/025849.wav|let's say five to seven years influencers and creators have drastically changed the
data/005651.wav|while we're all getting dinner together
data/023824.wav|going to cry i haven't seen one tie
data/026838.wav|one of the big stories of all the
data/008500.wav|why it was actually quite readable it was long but
data/012130.wav|but it's not like they had no ideas like it was a cool idea so so yeah we shoot the ship the ship stops
data/012978.wav|or not even awful but the most burnt out
data/022363.wav|now i don't have a very high bar for soap but
data/026103.wav|of a person sort of putting their physical
data/022975.wav|one big obviously but they're not they're nowhere near the the
data/014619.wav|that are great pickups for youtube
data/004143.wav|because it turns out turns out
data/001411.wav|three and d three and d three
data/015774.wav|do cable services stand any chance against these guys no cable is dead cable is dead and dying they're they're selling all
data/007091.wav|a solo chic main has never won a major tournament ever in the history
data/014733.wav|it's like i'm watching six tick
data/012286.wav|this guy on the right is an adult and you know the the crew are playing along there's one actor
data/008497.wav|and i found the funny parts
data/012895.wav|well i mean the best decision i ever made was
data/031790.wav|it's other minecraft viewers you can see how
data/015883.wav|which has all the pirated content from disney and netflix okay but it makes it more money it
data/000056.wav|no no no there's no marketing money i
data/014290.wav|a chart that i am calling
data/008002.wav|it's a compliment to myself i'm not
data/027420.wav|with everybody makes mistakes everybody has those days trying to be quote unquote relatable cool for them i guess and then
data/012886.wav|we don't do what i did because it
data/030512.wav|you know i forget exactly what i said but it was like
data/008616.wav|i dunno whatever you know it could be
data/029610.wav|or assertively rejecting cherished beliefs and institutions or established values and practices
data/024562.wav|without using the ios app store at all apple would be within their legal rights
data/003711.wav|it's like you have to sell on amazon and then they find out what sells based on
data/020278.wav|rose celebrities on them this is not that
data/003285.wav|what it was a win for unique interpretations of events never saw heat waves like this before the vaccine makes you wonder so that could be a win because
data/008914.wav|and person and i think he's cool and he's
data/030197.wav|he did not fall he slow
data/014935.wav|services let's jump into it today's topic oh wait wait
data/009333.wav|organic milk and organic vanilla powder i i've never read the word organic that many times
data/011740.wav|in person that i meet is from naboo
data/027882.wav|innovation things start to build it's
data/012915.wav|will be able to attribute it to you and i
data/013532.wav|his name was john and he played jigglypuff
data/020936.wav|the two years ago broke as a joke demands in a two million dollar
data/026633.wav|over half the value of sony as
data/022028.wav|this is again comes from i think a deep lack of understanding of how social works how sort of the group think of it works and how the immediate nature of it works so now i'm
data/028143.wav|they are losing money and so naturally a company that only makes 50 million in
data/006058.wav|hanging out with clint and also i do like
data/001696.wav|of the mom should have gone
data/017483.wav|i think it is a way within the system to
data/027853.wav|there is some entertainment value in that he was running luna which is what's called a stable coin with the idea being that it's tied to the us dollar and thus is much more stable but unfortunately all
data/027209.wav|actually find themselves liking it that means it was able to stand out
data/000065.wav|or celery that's the most fun
data/031509.wav|perfect robot would do there is no optimal play
data/031635.wav|great and you know what there's a lot of fans of yours all over the world you know i was just drunk and i remember he looked at me
data/019847.wav|anthem anthem is number six on our most
data/015392.wav|i meant to be watched on a samsung smart fridge okay the same day
data/022294.wav|so lovingly as sweet music plays
data/019879.wav|this game i can't think of one game where the graphics have been this good and the game this disappointing and it's beautiful and it's clearly made by star wars fans and it has so much detail
data/008358.wav|i you know destruction of savings will ludwig survive the recession
data/028756.wav|water springs and told me that
data/017130.wav|little do you know i'm still haunted by the
data/011558.wav|rick and morty is one piece for geniuses yes well said
data/009184.wav|i know why but it's like just those the way the numbers are displayed it's like i want that green dude
data/027602.wav|anyway so that that's happening and will likely happen he's
data/003334.wav|labour market is so tight we are actually have some leveraging power as workers at different companies and people are finally beginning to use that now we have to
data/011697.wav|so okay so let me let me see i have videos i have videos
data/008285.wav|let's put the minions let's put the

data/031506.wav|you are even the best of the best players do everything wrong there is not a single thing like in
data/028276.wav|one guy on the community team have been
data/013314.wav|that's my theory it's crazy call me crazy call me crazy i think that's what you do i think sometimes when i ask
data/007763.wav|well i went live i'm literally pantsless i'm
data/019597.wav|my entire life the best part of waking up is folders in
data/001333.wav|i couldn't believe it it was a it was a very sturdy
data/023550.wav|that is the monopoly strategy what the really scary monopolies like amazon do is they keep these prices low so you never suspect them of a monopoly
data/030270.wav|by the way my hair looks amazing i pulled the bottle out and it wasn't
data/029121.wav|this was when they picked up an item called the helix
data/007982.wav|and so it's funny to see you guys question
data/014502.wav|can going anywhere with twitch so he was getting
data/007493.wav|i don't know what i don't know
data/007651.wav|the war for the streaming throne and it's
data/024246.wav|it was part of like a documentary and
data/010760.wav|enjoy it but i think i think
data/030238.wav|good i'm glad i had a love story ready for when
data/019265.wav|setting itself up to be one of the closest console wars in the history we just went through all those
data/000335.wav|the thing and at one point i think i think there's a zombie behind me and it's not a zombie it's ludwig and i
data/027746.wav|and in fact today they announced that meta will
data/003554.wav|too much and didn't know what i was
data/007108.wav|and so i had two choices i could either go
data/003637.wav|you know boomers are all reaching dying age of around you know late
data/025963.wav|and that leaves them with no talent to make the games they need to save
data/020219.wav|it's just pork this one's censored it must have been
data/009955.wav|will you pay somebody to object at your
data/022561.wav|put out on the town that's right
data/014770.wav|the marketing monday proper with the wins and fails and before i do
data/009902.wav|you have to do is go complain at the
data/004521.wav|and you next to her typing this
data/016617.wav|and as we approach a demographic
data/003253.wav|dollar contribution that becomes ten thousand
data/020443.wav|what is happening and where is it going let's talk about cyberpunk here's what i want to say so the
data/005960.wav|the stage and only one man has the bravery the
data/018327.wav|eight to 12 months a spec has
data/022992.wav|are our terms don't allow this it's a possible leak in the system and
data/014499.wav|i don't need a bagel that bad
data/001555.wav|i shouldn't even though you did answer it quite well i will give you one more bonus question now let me think here
data/024925.wav|i want to show you one of the scariest quotes from again let's go whaling and
data/026604.wav|is wacky and fun don't mention other networks or competitive ip example this
data/018181.wav|okay the average age is old as
data/022516.wav|if the gross food that we're spending air time
data/015153.wav|is squid game now squid game was a recent launch as i've mentioned
data/001538.wav|it's like absurd it's like i'm asking you can you
data/020568.wav|if you committed fraud on me i hate you i'll never trust you again that's an
data/017058.wav|i'm thinking about becoming a marketing
data/015967.wav|lead right now for cloud streaming they might just run away with it they might
data/013091.wav|the line where they know they're talking
data/029740.wav|and he was just yelling seventh place seventh place really loudly in my ear
data/008504.wav|musk is backed out but he he's he's not like
data/024294.wav|up your alley did it need to
data/021972.wav|this is a real story that he remembers
data/025813.wav|to speak nothing about the hong kong situation the other companies blizzard who did the same things but worse it's both and yet for some reason
data/013823.wav|where's back in the day for nintendo but all i
data/022947.wav|billion dollar company winning does not make them into a
data/030431.wav|know how to pose for these photo i don't
data/010659.wav|so and then we played some games super fun i'm very excited we have a great team it's me mango
data/005902.wav|he literally said everyone needs to go on stream and say that i and say that i paid
data/001465.wav|as the musician for or quack one of the two
data/026599.wav|am i won't even commentate dwarp
data/017593.wav|this is more of an older example but gap has stood out from its peers in places like malls which are all dying in general by a better
data/030253.wav|three days i realized i have got to shower oh my god
data/002439.wav|i feel like i'm i'm getting getting to
data/019083.wav|why be comfortable with the uncanny valley is as you get closer to looking like a real human it gets more and more creepy so for example a pixar character is not creepy because you can tell it's
data/027852.wav|as company is down this guy's coin is down
data/013280.wav|i don't believe in you guys it would just be me yelling at you guys
data/028600.wav|so i was pretty good at
data/015782.wav|doing research for this i found
data/013217.wav|in person who that you are the one person that i know for a fact has
data/031310.wav|water bottle so i'm just gonna put it back i'm not thinking about
data/013892.wav|watch it again watch it again you absolute nincompoop you probably didn't even reach hour five
data/031698.wav|well later like 20 minutes later start dropping
data/011428.wav|it's tough for me to judge an editing resume
data/008362.wav|unfortunately it's not greed it's way
data/026098.wav|in my life sorry i'm not high my portfolio is yeah
data/021039.wav|first of all i think we
data/019096.wav|well who are entertaining enough v
data/015066.wav|if you guys remember had almost everything on it almost every movie almost every show early netflix was was the was the complete package
data/014824.wav|so only a few weeks later they
data/016421.wav|if they get all that price appreciation and then
data/026313.wav|apple is a company that sells the
data/011657.wav|abu with the stock market so i sold a lot
data/009347.wav|i i've talked about it somebody made up me and stan some accounts and maybe we'll
data/030399.wav|listen we have a very important crossroads approaching us sir
data/031429.wav|i dunno how they understood anything either way it got back to the neighbors who then called the owners and got mad at them who then called ludwig and got mad at him
data/015365.wav|but money isn't everything which is good because hbo max
data/002875.wav|of options but they also move very quickly situations like this
data/001400.wav|but i need i need i need a trivia question that they can't just google and they will they will do that
data/012215.wav|all the way to him and
data/018667.wav|while competition its competition was xbox and
data/008278.wav|and that's that we'll talk about
data/029709.wav|at any moment he could turn it on because
data/015943.wav|and again making a good stream
data/021891.wav|alex piece of advice is probably the most important thing not a joke in this whole presentation
data/028680.wav|that's why i got this pillow and
data/008279.wav|well we'll talk about all that stuff so uh i'm
data/023913.wav|when i was a kid i was always like i
data/015217.wav|this is why i think they're one
data/031733.wav|as ever seen those ai generated animes and
data/009804.wav|worse than the crash of the deutsche mark absolutely not no that was that was
data/024148.wav|the cold war kind of started
data/014528.wav|yes king yes that is what the streaming wars is all
data/005075.wav|is that he's good at which i think tesla is a
data/017466.wav|i joined in and when kellogg's posted online applications for scabs to
data/017513.wav|i want you to know that it's not funny to me i don't enjoy it these people
data/017553.wav|okay since then it's been an outsized level of success okay and there are many reasons for this
data/015625.wav|and this was an article recently this year
data/028018.wav|at are increasing the wealthy is actually one of the best tools to combat inflation but i don't think that he is interested in that solution i think he mostly wants to talk about people getting checks back during the pandemic
data/030101.wav|or eat that food or you could talk to it and so again this
data/015492.wav|but it's but that's that's kind of a interesting
data/024857.wav|is what you do this is how games like clash of clans make a lot of money this is how like hearthstone makes its money competitive advantage and this is what works on me okay then for
data/014760.wav|you know he might he might play at
data/021496.wav|for a month and that time is coming due and they're
data/001054.wav|yo bachelor boy enjoy your time thanks
data/026087.wav|i wearing a tank top that being said i'm a gigantic jake and
data/021927.wav|pay taxes because i'll go to jail
data/000649.wav|and we all got players cards too the
data/011162.wav|you put on that tv whose leg is that to the left oh that's just my girl
data/025473.wav|is a huge deal um stanz
data/022342.wav|no explanation and i that literally was because
data/002015.wav|if the balls and then i in conversation
data/003924.wav|at the battle jeb v hunter
data/007796.wav|or something i could do a
data/029261.wav|on on reddit on twitter and my email on my twitch
data/024428.wav|in the back to the future movies but
data/006156.wav|back-to-back crowns no big deal one of them golds through and through yeah three monitors yeah
data/018748.wav|noticeable camera change in the back and
data/024526.wav|oh an unduly large part of the trial was
data/001063.wav|bad when you see mine oh yeah my bad okay well don't i mean
data/018275.wav|at first yes but i don't work here yet then why do you keep coming back when i was in the service my dad he sent me this book and it was written by the guy who started this company and every word in the book i mean i wanted to be that guy and when i got back i thought the best way to learn would be to work here you know i wrote that book yes i know that your
data/004476.wav|doubling the meat in a food shortage
data/011144.wav|in the wealth that's for the future
data/004024.wav|it'd be a little bit annoying you
data/002201.wav|i i write it off of my taxes it's
data/018120.wav|with your mom and you bought a
data/012829.wav|at the time he was the head of
data/004284.wav|i'm talking make a clip of this and we're going to listen it back and i'm going to
data/023440.wav|god so it actually did not leave me a lot of time to study for this class in order to help myself learn the material for an upcoming final project i'm going to teach it to you now i want to give full credit to section
data/007514.wav|that was the original joe's bacon and eggs
data/027142.wav|you're faced with two choices to get inflation back under control they have to raise interest rates and the second
data/013993.wav|are psychologically susceptible they are more likely to buy things that they cannot afford so
data/007819.wav|and we'll do a little react actually
data/008895.wav|i think people that are really into the
data/023775.wav|and it with a short and bald
data/026607.wav|the reading the line don't mention
data/023969.wav|we've had situation have been very uh surface
data/014569.wav|one feature ever just just invest the money just do it right i know it's hard i know it's technically difficult but like the rewards are there just do it right now they did there's like a button you can press like it's near clips or something is it gone they got rid of it
data/015736.wav|i have lots of the great example tesla i did it for ted lasso is a great example ted i did
data/025257.wav|exclusive first leak clip from the movie
data/002804.wav|if the for once holy moly we're gonna kick
data/009399.wav|is he picked it's corky and uh
data/029444.wav|out of the room so i can just talk to this guy
data/009413.wav|if you like is a panic pick for the first time can i say that tsm that's that's
data/017598.wav|figure advertising company but they really have
data/026619.wav|so i made a tweet today that i would like to share with you just a casual
data/002772.wav|a different time zone but at 6
data/012723.wav|and it could have taken years for my
data/015029.wav|if the movies you want to see and in about
data/022079.wav|what the bank is this one why is my balance so low bank
data/006634.wav|bring the game at every quarter googling what the biggest comeback in
data/008857.wav|i can do that i think it's possible that both parties agree to that because here's the deal the real
data/010557.wav|have you would ruin my night no i have no desire to do it i
data/009293.wav|is mentally they're just very susceptible and so if they're playing a game that has loot boxes they like cannot resist
data/005045.wav|okay we don't want to actually engage with other people it's too much pressure half of twitter is fighting it's too angry
data/014205.wav|and what is the real problem for youtube because look
data/031437.wav|it was about here it goes about here and i know
data/024349.wav|rep now wait are they aviva
data/015996.wav|i every star wars movie every marvel movie every
data/011630.wav|it's she just knows a lot about things she's
data/002648.wav|but once it comes up you take your money and you leave you will be winning this one this is free money so all i need you
data/022674.wav|the myriad of ways this was a dumb deal so i thought
data/007209.wav|if you didn't know if the offer was serious or whatever he was too
data/003920.wav|in the highest office in the land of 300
data/015484.wav|are losing so much money they're losing so much money when they give it all to you on disney plus and
data/005367.wav|and i'm still doing it i still don't believe it like i'm still
data/024568.wav|the judge like fully upheld apple's right to
data/006218.wav|no no no no no it's a little different
data/007338.wav|it up getting the 30 himself
data/017091.wav|from nvidia this is a loner laptop they have stickers on it so you know
data/026099.wav|yeah it was a good one
data/013761.wav|making the right moves this is what will put them back on top this is what fans have been asking for ever since they first heard about diablo mobile they've been saying we have phones blizzard why don't you never know
data/002010.wav|if the milk tea exactly that's exactly what i like i don't the little balls in there they're like
data/025757.wav|to answered for so they always go absolutely over the top with making you feel something
data/020122.wav|finding their foothold in social media
data/018349.wav|if you know you're not going to get stuck
data/001684.wav|that does not mean it is perfect our goal is to expose the dark underbelly of the story to reveal once and for all the truth about the only
data/006555.wav|get it but i'm just saying it's not free money so if you're poor and you spend
data/006652.wav|i think we got some funny stuff and some good stuff and i
data/027522.wav|fuck are these people working on i've always
data/020232.wav|at turkey for winning stay tuned for
data/023120.wav|because it's you don't know what the that
data/015719.wav|actually believe in so it's cool
data/031789.wav|but in general minecraft viewers watch
data/021890.wav|this is a weird segue because the next
data/023139.wav|sales skyrocketed through the roof again
data/009416.wav|in the back that's a bully pick it's a bad idea
data/020901.wav|your parents will tell you that they think this is the good investment advice buy a house get a starter home real estate is not a good place to start building your your investment okay if you have if you have rich parents or
data/030980.wav|in this person that makes dream look like a
data/028322.wav|is in the break room when dj wheat strolls up with his young son mini wheat
data/023806.wav|man reality shift reality shift out
data/028670.wav|all the time dude twitch culture was like a
data/032210.wav|so we go to the crab stables sunday
data/000432.wav|it's just we can hear him like when we run back and we're playing the other table we can hear the dealer
data/010607.wav|and half the battle is you guys not saying things that are so effing stupid that i have to
data/022012.wav|it doesn't work the second thing is that there's some people saying well all press is good press and obviously that is not true people already knew what bird king was
data/001115.wav|well yeah and it's weird to think aatrak is
data/025249.wav|and then i guess we will do the most hated brands and that of course goes to nintendo i haven't been able to talk about nintendo's direct
data/032039.wav|job is win dot dot dot and then i wrote
data/023631.wav|oh my god dude the ice government pride month post
data/032108.wav|had an orgy i guess which is where scar's kid came from
data/000491.wav|nick allen dead asleep i grab both
data/027314.wav|it'd be careful here for people who may not have a lot of other things they are accomplished or or proud about it can almost be like
data/024755.wav|been around in various forms across mobile for a long time
data/013212.wav|it's perfect you're a harry potter fan
data/021462.wav|that still have some revenue but are declining and so today they basically just called in all their billionaire rich favors to stop millions of average people from being able to trade
data/019205.wav|facts message boards and I would talk
data/028391.wav|we think you're not thinking globally enough and i find that to be quite
data/021086.wav|we'll just pop this over here perfect let's see
data/004854.wav|is he really no one thinks you made this
data/025864.wav|if we've already got you playing
data/011723.wav|with the full story and we're gonna decide
data/017103.wav|find a photo of me doing work at the
data/028871.wav|how am i alive yeah i totally yeah yeah
data/025458.wav|work experience for every project you're involved in
data/031914.wav|i am not we're not going wild here and in the back of the limo was like uh like
data/023041.wav|netscape was the biggest browser and microsoft said nah
data/005574.wav|that's actually really cool so uh
data/020274.wav|it's a knock at coco's dominance of the
data/022319.wav|dale blackout across all taco bell's social
data/012896.wav|signing up for that resume review on linkedin at riot games that won me a
data/003765.wav|and i think if it was something we consistently
data/004094.wav|i think it's about time i got deeply into becoming
data/028706.wav|i am talking in the days leading up to this event with my future boss at
data/020175.wav|arms clubs oh i'm sorry i'm sorry oh
data/016505.wav|i have hours understanding it now none of us myself included
data/007386.wav|if the for a minute and loved hbox listen i
data/002507.wav|part of the whole game to me was that reveal
data/001287.wav|let's see let's see let's see
data/014559.wav|the contract's not in that way
data/029865.wav|and it felt terrible it was the worst feeling this was why they were the gods
data/024360.wav|want to see what happens they kind of
data/028978.wav|i started eating and i survived not a week a week would actually kill you i survived three days off of water from the tap the sink in my room and and candy and i have never felt more terrible than day three again
data/019555.wav|i get in touch with him and just ask him
data/003094.wav|but unfortunately the rising cost of all goods fuel energy rent housing and the stagnation of wages is causing more people to feel financially insecure than ever before which is going to have major political consequences during the midterms and could be destabilizing not only for our country but for a lot of countries around the globe
data/003792.wav|i'm sorry just talking like talking
data/005041.wav|of that tweet super funny by the way been enjoying
data/007202.wav|really wanted it but felt shy to ask like he didn't want to ask so i told
data/016906.wav|if the business is growing dramatically
data/011602.wav|was really good if you haven't checked it out it's
data/028709.wav|oh yeah i'm press team liquid
data/012818.wav|in the biggest i feel like
data/006829.wav|fun you'll have a great time there's a story it's it's actually it's just a really
data/005431.wav|i just said is scripted every part of this including the chatters there's like 14 paid
data/014558.wav|again because it's not possible i don't have
data/002490.wav|are trash on it it would set up a big pringles
data/012732.wav|unpredictable if you work really hard sometimes you don't make it like you
data/021710.wav|will need to be amputated it might not
data/030112.wav|hold it to my lips hey pikachu
data/010782.wav|there are two balloons inside of us all
data/016069.wav|and and other cutting edge fields for marketing he taught me to have analytical mindset driven goals and to
data/006226.wav|yeah um go all in with seven deuce off suit
data/027801.wav|the party in power always loses when the great recession happened
data/029683.wav|during his prime he was virtually unbeatable
data/003114.wav|at the competing service so i don't know maybe it's just
data/027848.wav|still be here you know like 95
data/025199.wav|well picture a bad way to start um
data/019801.wav|because they were so sure it
data/020565.wav|best buy and they buy the physical copy and they put
data/007492.wav|yeah it was like a pea patty i don't
data/020259.wav|generally you're going to find yourself rejected
data/002217.wav|we don't belong here too he said some of
data/018640.wav|wait a little bit more every game company now has to include in their budget if they're smart money for twitch and youtube influencers they have to they have to spend money on on these things if you're going to make your game big you got to spend money on
data/023473.wav|to make so they have a gigantic margin but pretty low market share
data/019392.wav|in this is where jason and a good data person really makes marketing shine jason made this
data/006731.wav|i don't leave my house often except for
data/024909.wav|and and i'll explain that real quick it's basically the thinking that you are more likely to hit a roll because you didn't
data/030075.wav|it is agony okay i go to my birthday i don't get a gift and like
data/009012.wav|and people jump in and we just have a little fun
data/024696.wav|could be massive so evergrand again this is the start of
data/010472.wav|in fact i never have in fact i've
data/027372.wav|speaking of learning and laughing let's get to the wins and fails starting off
data/004329.wav|if i guess what's tom holland know about
data/003220.wav|well who took out massive loans to buy their own pokemon
data/020047.wav|if the that subscribe button it costs you nothing
data/026009.wav|was defraud let's get back to the wins though
data/021189.wav|it's bump right here is 29
data/009059.wav|oh wait a minute hold up wait a minute
data/001766.wav|to be a lovable hero so i don't know that it's only the meme we're talking about and it's funny because he was kind of a
data/029979.wav|as the first time i don't believe so maybe like
data/021342.wav|it would be so sick to get that
data/007440.wav|it's like there's just there's there's too many in circulation i
data/031769.wav|well a little bit deep on these uh
data/003297.wav|i give me that one uh and
data/013648.wav|women relate to you and then i can't tell you that story
data/005410.wav|amman exposure though because literally you say
data/026625.wav|i had no this was not a mirror because 70 billion dollars

data/000642.wav|to always come back to all they hate when you come back and
data/009425.wav|is not that much because he has so much compounded experience over the entire game but if you have somebody who's played only a little bit they have probably one or two champions of experience and it falls off hard so them getting banned out is way worse
data/028371.wav|as many times in a row as you can some business meetings
data/002329.wav|and we're going to watch them so much

data/003415.wav|to taiwan by the united states about 200
data/002452.wav|i think more like would jeff would
data/021415.wav|wait right here when volkswagen hit the peak of the squeeze it was the most valuable company on planet earth for a moment but the problem was now it was regular guys a lot of them against a lot of millionaires too by the way the average
data/006102.wav|even one i don't like he
data/017923.wav|they focused way more on this area to get repeat consumers
data/011992.wav|is allied with you so like because i'm like getting this text
data/028238.wav|i like blur a lot i've only had one
data/000935.wav|or three are me me me right now you have been here for two months and you've only showed up when

data/002032.wav|is going to be working with me on magic that as well
data/019443.wav|i didn't want to start this early we have to review it
data/011357.wav|to see what happens yeah he
data/031403.wav|the boat at one point we decided we're
data/010218.wav|i like the the new one no no no the old one and

data/000724.wav|it's very sweet very very kind
data/009316.wav|isn't that like is very acceptable
data/021702.wav|i start to finish that would have been
data/026232.wav|now pay later so you understand my dilemma here there is no advantage it's starting to have problems because people that are attracted
data/009126.wav|who's third warren buffett we put them all together we can we can finally write something even
data/019989.wav|interacts with like sony and other companies so even if you buy marvel half the
data/027789.wav|it's called raising interest rates and when that happens it is
data/003836.wav|good at marketing it because literally at the
data/012182.wav|when the ship i go into the pazak room
data/014771.wav|do that i want to announce sorry one second i want to announce a brand new
data/018521.wav|alex originals come from what microsoft is

data/012233.wav|we both have four cards it's an
data/011865.wav|one more thing that i don't
data/004383.wav|go back and forth because we know we know
data/031458.wav|a team of private chefs waiting a team of private chefs waiting
data/011446.wav|while find your house show up you cut it i'll immediately
data/001049.wav|isn't that wild like i'm sure all the
data/011635.wav|fake spaceship where you can literally live on the spaceship okay and everything's in character and it's a whole it's like a legitimate
data/019247.wav|yeah I'd be watching a movie in a
data/003649.wav|for generations and the fact that we
data/004188.wav|like please check i don't think that was you i think that was i think that was probably someone related
data/008390.wav|i tweet once a month so you know it's
data/003069.wav|jump into something else the problem is here's the problem
data/019750.wav|imagine 20 years from now i
data/013231.wav|i think was we all knew
data/022009.wav|and there's a school bully and you're like i'm
data/013030.wav|did he get scammed oh yeah yeah sort of we landed on that it was
data/001100.wav|is number one the weather's always hot so people are outside a lot and then number
data/004710.wav|that is happening that that is happening and in fact i mentioned this in the
data/022740.wav|motorola and they said all right seven billion for a phone company that's that's chump change all right we're
data/022139.wav|in mailchimp and so like i didn't know what i was writing about yet so i just put
data/011682.wav|i'm not a theater kid you know i'm not discord mod could be worse maybe you're right
data/013227.wav|and what's been bracken dude any
data/025961.wav|and with blizzard this has been meteoric this is four studios formed in the past
data/014366.wav|what gamers so that's one more nuclear bomb the next over here i have is drops twitches drops
data/027626.wav|i think ever starts leaning on
data/023392.wav|when my boomer boss's boss made me print out emails print them out and take a red marker and go through
data/009375.wav|the way you play these is you find the absolute shittiest player on their team you triple band them
data/012317.wav|what's it cost and then it was like well it's not
data/008765.wav|like there's bots for sure but it's not like
data/003947.wav|show up one time he would tell the spoon story we'd all laugh
data/032313.wav|for showed the hall of gods because i had been slowly chipping away at all the radiance this guy says and then right after this he showed that he beat the hall of gods on radiant that surprised me so much which was my
data/029119.wav|time to start because that was by far the biggest stream that twitch had ever seen
data/027067.wav|people it just it felt like
data/013138.wav|every media company is trying to become everything like they want to have their
data/008965.wav|sort of says so unless you
data/014596.wav|let's see what we got i'm just
data/016624.wav|let me see if i can get my exact stat here
data/026183.wav|up with you better pray for these little guys a goddamn rat has a better gaming monitor than me
data/007600.wav|thank you for the birthday prime i appreciate that
data/004516.wav|at making the most baseline like sarcastic joke and everyone's like giving me more credit than i deserve
data/022828.wav|pretty clearly you know if you looked at last friday the market cap of aol was twice the size of
data/005514.wav|plenty plenty of problems with the gas prices no doubt no doubt the gas prices were
data/029878.wav|i was talking about i was probably working
data/024440.wav|when beings we are not desensitized to this yet so if you're walking around
data/015598.wav|and they don't have gigantic ambitions
data/022360.wav|the talking points in our ad read
data/029515.wav|and maybe they squeak one out maybe they
data/025248.wav|figure out something new to do i don't
data/002667.wav|you don't have to tell me because
data/008201.wav|it is said we'll give you 40 million
data/007101.wav|if the game of thrones but ever since
data/025026.wav|okay now this is pretty common
data/006365.wav|at based on the math of rolling for it
data/002053.wav|you can't hear it oops sucks for you
data/031498.wav|put in more hours in the
data/024454.wav|they've been having declining same store sales and
data/001576.wav|you promise not to cheat on this following question
data/001829.wav|be affordable and so and to make it work
data/008158.wav|what he's doing and why he's coming on in
data/025992.wav|we're supposed to be part of a campaign they weren't approved tweets but they
data/000547.wav|and nick was uh was autumn
data/007919.wav|it's a binary system and it gets the job done you know what it gets the job
data/020488.wav|are game they've made the witcher battle
data/008799.wav|is also pretty airtight like it's like
data/001759.wav|i'm not taking any cruise ships back character draws the
data/000480.wav|i sit in bed and i'm just dizzy and i'm waiting and i'm so tired
data/005140.wav|in the first of all i'm gonna play
data/025787.wav|the most damning thing you could have happened
data/000180.wav|is the real hangover if you think about it dude it
data/025727.wav|once or twice the idea is that these bite-sized horror flicks could go viral get shared a lot the best way to make content on the internet right now is by optimizing for word of mouth if you are creating a short form piece of content for the internet try to imagine how it gets shared in a group chat if you have not designed
data/023136.wav|with the dolphins but consumers were concerned that they were somehow harming dolphins when they ate it
data/005587.wav|so you can imagine with this
data/025628.wav|so if you are a pc gamer this is a win and this is a product of pretty unique market dynamics i mean this is a
data/023442.wav|in my own words and and with you know my own examples and stuff but it is essentially their stuff and if any of you become marketing professionals be
data/011266.wav|it's way too dank on everyone
data/007477.wav|and it's like i was ordering like bacon
data/002050.wav|also say i'm not looking for nobody with
data/014453.wav|blast copyrighted music and you're not going to
data/024852.wav|we item they want to feel they want to fill that hole
data/013691.wav|he is the most passive ceo ever finally he quit today and as someone who owns a lot of
data/002397.wav|while with two aerosol cans on his way out
data/021211.wav|these are going to decline none of these have the breadth of content and the rate of new content to uh to keep subscribers in the era of
data/028774.wav|by the way they asked me what i was making now
data/016064.wav|where are you afraid to say it out loud because it was
data/015729.wav|you'd think piracy has been declining basically every year
data/027184.wav|last week to absolutely enormous critical success one of the highest rated games of all time a true instant classic
data/030227.wav|credit for that jordan had his flu game
data/009679.wav|well already wish i was a little bit dumber to be honest i already wish i was
data/014566.wav|albert it's like only in weird 30
data/019385.wav|let me be clear that there were no threats to enron
data/020643.wav|you know how you feel a little bit down um and you're like worried about how you
data/032243.wav|the asian man this guy shows up at the table with
data/020449.wav|we talked about overhyped games in the past is
data/010818.wav|it'll play a game make it family friendly and i was like oh
data/023185.wav|iraq because i get all the money oh also one more thing if you are feeling depressed consider buying like a value meal because the great value from a place like mcdonald's or burger king will make you feel a lot better can we give it up
data/016967.wav|i was thinking maybe we could watch a shark tank maybe we could watch a shark tank
data/029099.wav|we're doing that there's a reason why pokemon has become the largest franchise in the history of entertainment i know the reason hot
data/015479.wav|and they have the greatest ip and their
data/021522.wav|the people and you know i think it's inappropriate
data/014087.wav|facebook gaming with the worst logo in history
data/029374.wav|elon musk they start talking about elon musk and all the things he's doing and elon musk in
data/031865.wav|and that's a bad look especially now that n a
data/002491.wav|and then people would pick sides and they'll be people are like i love
data/018766.wav|a larger market share i think possibly
data/015343.wav|it needs to be good to save their business because amazon doesn't need the content to be good no one on their side is really passionate about making good content which means a lot of their shows end up worse than they could be okay on the exact opposite of that spectrum is hbo max but first i'm
data/014059.wav|almost every engineer that i meet in silicon valley thinks
data/023797.wav|with the idea and i've always been excited about it and
data/020641.wav|are shy lately he's actually feeling kind of depressed
data/029404.wav|i will i will let you know later it has to be immediate
data/025395.wav|which is actually kind of gangster and so now i'm back on board as a
data/024418.wav|up but let's get a win going here i saw
data/029275.wav|in canada i'm at least top five
data/016689.wav|at looking to create their own car because the future of cars is in some way self-driving and
data/013182.wav|all live in one lab why would my audience be so localized to an antarctica lab how does that make
data/002904.wav|it's in america just yet but it's in quite a few countries and i believe it is rolling out
data/001542.wav|everyone knows that i just i scrolled down as far as i could on famous paintings he acted like he
data/020032.wav|it's just nothing it's just nothing now they are worth an estimated and part of their contribution to google
data/024947.wav|and order i know that a
data/027514.wav|as a week on twitter didn't care there was no progress i myself have visited twitter headquarters and i was stunned it's a very nice building in in like the heart of downtown san francisco you know really expensive real estate so back in
data/025791.wav|him off the list blizzard has done it they've taken
data/020890.wav|technology isn't far as far along as the media makes you think it is we're five years away from autonomous
data/012846.wav|put in i had put in like 14
data/008985.wav|no no no no no they already they always
data/026129.wav|passive ceo ever finally he quit today and as someone who owns a lot of
data/024138.wav|well that was the peak of comedy comedy has now peaked no one else should even
data/022322.wav|twitter facebook tumblr and so forth
data/020932.wav|storage storage is competing against old lazy businesses like who's that
data/032266.wav|this whole thing was a sham casinos exist for their profit not yours
data/009527.wav|it that alt on a carry
data/021347.wav|okay it's the story of the day let me preface this by saying that i know for a fact that people are very emotionally driven when it comes to this thing so no matter what advice i give you you won't listen everyone's like
data/032184.wav|is the two sixes the 12 in which
data/009522.wav|i will defend i want to defend i want to
data/023559.wav|the a gucci belt at like 100 bucks
data/029476.wav|but i met him at a convention and
data/025693.wav|you're selling consoles to gamers i
data/024429.wav|literally better than what it looked like in those movies where the jaws
data/018470.wav|oh boy i'll see you in
data/007961.wav|i like to shout them out
data/014937.wav|the streaming wars but before we jump into it i think i have to do one question from my sponsor before we jump into it let's do
data/008809.wav|but like you could just back out
data/016457.wav|as the people having less money as a huge positive is just so sick it's just so nasty and so i wanted to perfectly shout out this guy oh
data/001937.wav|in-depth marketing mondays and stuff like that
data/020761.wav|it is the overall most important person in marketing for the year
data/032422.wav|ready for extra hits in phase two if you're
data/000748.wav|some awesome awesome dudes and i i you know i i've been
data/017726.wav|who bubble club these are all parts
data/016177.wav|you're you're saving money every step sold my dog for tickets to this marketing monday hopefully it's worth it you sold your dog for tickets
data/004420.wav|but first he had to take a
data/005186.wav|hold up thank you skyler4204 for
data/012330.wav|and colored you know like the steam buns with
data/000462.wav|so i get to the hotel room and i oh oh by the way dude i
data/022177.wav|let's see where he goes from here
data/019593.wav|thus we can bridge the gap i'm gonna put this in a solid a tier i think this is the best
data/018546.wav|was going to be bleeding money for the launch this xbox
data/031439.wav|the ball i gotta respect it
data/019792.wav|in the first day of this kickstarter it touched the nerve in the gaming
data/030778.wav|going to happen i just want you to know that so i'm
data/004934.wav|is worth way less than what he legally
data/014296.wav|until now but youtube's last dick strategy is
data/010005.wav|he hasn't really crossed over into twitter they're not i don't think twitter even knows
data/004033.wav|everyone's already played the cat game i'm a little late to the party
data/021438.wav|one board but as i said in the opening clip
data/029856.wav|we sat in the middle of this rich family's
data/001357.wav|the team she hooked us up so
data/032095.wav|get a great angle though blood
data/016874.wav|this is uh media use and it turns out that the
data/021081.wav|for dinner yeah i thought we would try something new that's weird it's not weird your pants are weird eggs for dinner isn't weird you're weird for thinking it's weird wait this was
data/005269.wav|i don't even i don't even really i just i'm a really good
data/031684.wav|in the feed while getting carried by challengers in order to get
data/023741.wav|i use them every night before i go to bed when i listen to podcasts the
data/000572.wav|a really bad show while high and everyone
data/030583.wav|you know i remember having the decency
data/006435.wav|immaculate orb of brilliance of which there are currently only
data/007155.wav|andy anyone out of their opinions and they're often used to divide people
data/020108.wav|right around here he dies but all of this comes from the iphone and a lot of the eye products and
data/006884.wav|in silicon valley's like the peak dude
data/009982.wav|what are you talking about it's sitting on the ringer in addition
data/002893.wav|i just borrow against this they have no tax
data/018693.wav|for all eternity microsoft is worth
data/010633.wav|with them because who knows who's lurking on the other teams but i wrote notes i wrote notes like i was in a uh i
data/016940.wav|check my stocks um without that
data/004832.wav|is it the big ten count baby
data/009549.wav|in casual play like this every band changes the outcome of a match so much because you can just ruin
data/020941.wav|okay he actually brought it home a little bit in the end but i think in general it's
data/025740.wav|getting the message that's the hard part so the either the options are you do it poorly which
data/009175.wav|one out of tens that's why i um
data/028734.wav|we've got one vip ticket for you to the
data/009435.wav|i need right now because that
data/008932.wav|using my own logic my own judgment looking at
data/019825.wav|i mean really it's it if you consider
data/018367.wav|tell you something else the three things that are correlated with having a happy job with being happy with your job number one you feel like your work helps or impacts others now hear me out this does not mean that you are making a positive difference in the world
data/007161.wav|parts of the country have different opinions that are based on your surroundings
data/017815.wav|of explain a good way to think i've made one these for nvidia i literally have thought about this ad nvidia is not a this is not something i don't use i think it's of explain a good way to think i've made one of these for nvidia i literally have thought about this at nvidia this is not

data/008741.wav|anyway some of the other tweets they put in here
data/021433.wav|it makes money and they did not think of the customers as their boss they thought of citadel as
data/017165.wav|one more run to make up for their egregious
data/019079.wav|outnumbering real ones but i think we are close to a world where we have a fake influencer who has the reach and impact of the top real influencers at the end of the day it's just
data/030497.wav|with the stories of you know
data/008445.wav|i was so uninterested in it you know i mean
data/002886.wav|the man and even a 20 billion dollar fine is
data/015269.wav|amazon originals let's get into it prime

data/023963.wav|walk a little bit about what's
data/029906.wav|one talking head talking about how i
data/018053.wav|they are extremely exhausted and it doesn't seem likely that we can get
data/022630.wav|they literally like this girl actually said like i don't i don't think this would be a good one
data/008918.wav|yeah pay is my pa that's sick pay is handling the pay yeah there's there's

data/000964.wav|amount of bachelor party this weekend and he's
data/027346.wav|added value so while i think we should
data/009908.wav|survival depends on somebody looking at the
data/027726.wav|world though you have the pleasure you have the honor
data/016255.wav|good team and try to figure out if lebron james has ever been used as the picture
data/028075.wav|because they started looking around at the market and realizing that some of the other phone players were starting to add music functionality to phones music on phones starting to get a thing
data/022175.wav|with a disability suicide all in one dude they crammed
data/012593.wav|so i and they've they've fallen a lot
data/022749.wav|it was a bad deal for 2 billion so if you're doing the
data/027381.wav|is full i'd say well over half of
data/014834.wav|i'm sure the ceo bought a couple
data/009493.wav|team they call league of legends the
data/030740.wav|bit of course it's the number one
data/026693.wav|and so they come back and like
data/009863.wav|if the in europe for for quite a few years and i got to see you know the pros and cons and the differences and
data/025115.wav|you know what i think it is because nestle's
data/005142.wav|this is important this is really important hold hold hold
data/016911.wav|i hope you thought that was something we're talking about and if you're interested
data/020567.wav|it's one thing but i mean but it's not out but if they say i bought your game and you ripped me off
data/017158.wav|if you like me and you love the
data/008513.wav|elect somebody was actually gonna go through
data/022798.wav|which means they spent two billion for
data/000472.wav|when you're like drunk you lay down you get
data/003037.wav|one just has that thought instantly
data/001114.wav|i met most of my good friends through
data/000506.wav|okay because sunday hits and we are up thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars
data/025332.wav|my next fail speaking of squid game i
data/011911.wav|okay let me give you one
data/013467.wav|no it's not based that's that's wild i'm not saying i haven't done it a couple
data/019186.wav|in the early 90s when Nintendo became
data/001992.wav|be fun you can build a business pretty free
data/002617.wav|we're letting it ride heads heads tails donate to charity
data/030523.wav|if you're this is a societal norm that i don't think anyone has to adhere to but the idea is you're supposed to ask her father's permission my plan was
data/011609.wav|whoo bell fiona thank you for
data/031168.wav|i not say but at the end of the day at that scale at that size you can't
data/022742.wav|so that they bought motorola for 12 and
data/030110.wav|he's a little bit mad that he had to go and get it on today and he's also a little bit
data/014480.wav|the leadership more i just i get a vibe that things are going to be really cool here
data/007703.wav|but i watch it today it was surprisingly surprisingly entertaining surprisingly invested for not liking
data/024718.wav|earning years as things are really low so when you buy things like a house or stocks or whatever or your
data/027461.wav|at the dream out space twitter spaces maybe chiming in maybe making their own points
data/009137.wav|i know half of them are just elon
data/021916.wav|okay and we had chat members come in and ask them questions that's
data/000509.wav|at church and pray yeah yeah so on
data/013706.wav|i'm going to do a fail to um
data/004072.wav|you know love the content or like
data/011101.wav|he's trying to see if he should end a seven
data/020402.wav|if we can't be with his family on christmas
data/016683.wav|here's another one electronics as a percentage of total car costs this might not seem like an
data/010720.wav|do that like for example here's here's a random example what if you had a pretty solid amount of income higher than you'd ever had before but you wanted to hide some of it as a business expense well then what you'd do is you would
data/008835.wav|well because after he made the insanely overpriced offer
data/005356.wav|i don't know i listen i don't i barely even remember that interaction and so i'm not certain that he's going to be turning around and head dotting at me
data/018271.wav|prince favorite car commercial we're gonna
data/014325.wav|do you remember that early days of netflix it didn't make its own content they literally just had like they had friends on there they had the
data/002573.wav|there's only one way to do this we got
data/008248.wav|i really really influential and important in my life and he is going to be on the stream today and he's going to talk
data/003443.wav|really like to know how it's going
data/028960.wav|but mostly me and i don't know any of them they weren't part of my friend group so
data/002448.wav|on the weekends he goes to concerts and he has a problem with his mobile
data/001430.wav|you get no googling i need a scout's honor on no searching or googling
data/021116.wav|i think this is where i'll make my custard's last
data/015421.wav|in the streaming wars hulu exists for one reason things that are not brand appropriate for disney or things that already have a contract with other companies go on hulu that's it hulu is not going to win this war hulu will not exist eventually hulu only exists to
data/015600.wav|as a business not as a streaming service
data/007313.wav|why do together and they'd walk up to my chair in the front row and be like okay um how about seven to one
data/025079.wav|number five most hated company in america
data/031875.wav|the rise of riot games again league
data/012352.wav|that's when i was i was gonna try
data/017667.wav|stop spending the extra money on advertising and having a worse packaging might not
data/004681.wav|them doing a baseline google search and it's like me photoshopped on the head of a cow
data/005100.wav|was insane yeah because we have a million
data/003394.wav|if the the game are you trying to get friendly with
data/003895.wav|if the the of them are in power but the republican
data/023114.wav|and then everyone got really really really obese and they became kind of a problem and so in recent years
data/006423.wav|years becoming a master blacksmith and he's agreed to turn
data/032426.wav|in this game and feel threatened by someone else getting praise for doing them
data/003331.wav|the largest uptick in both media attention and
data/016084.wav|in the case study you can't be like i don't
data/024632.wav|was colossally wrong and stupid basically if you want to know what
data/014781.wav|if you have a side hustle
data/014805.wav|isn't that kind of thing uh
data/001237.wav|to like charlie emilio and she couldn't use herself in the ad that
data/015547.wav|in the minds and so what it seems like to me is that apple tv is the equivalent of jack dorsey ceo of twitter spending hundreds of millions of dollars to buy title he just wants to hang out with
data/026442.wav|the more subs you should learn from mango mango
data/031654.wav|i've been sleeping on the floor eating cheetos finally someone
data/020514.wav|only allowed to use trailer footage you couldn't record
data/016804.wav|a variety of services they haven't had
data/023732.wav|solves everything i actually use headphones for for me that's what makes me happy in an
data/023966.wav|big story of the past week and a lot of people tag me a lot of people dm me and
data/013859.wav|seen it but it has to be said this is the member list for the steam group called boycott modern warfare 2 we
data/013653.wav|the only one i am going to be the only mixer streamer i'm bringing it back okay that's right i spoke
data/021464.wav|if they would have lost literal billions so like whatever pr nightmare that robin hood gets it they they would rather take that hit than lose
data/009017.wav|one backing out of the twitter deal
data/016744.wav|nobody wants to be like nathan stands nobody wants to do it
data/029607.wav|i can't even that's crazy because
data/030475.wav|and i can talk in a board meeting at work and i can i don't feel generally nervous and i've been dating
data/009726.wav|get their nails ripped off with pliers you wouldn't be like whoa yakuza vibes it
data/002536.wav|there's a full 30 second timer to
data/019076.wav|the real world with social media as a character we feel like a line has been crossed we feel like there's this is not what we're comfortable doing and especially because at the end
data/029954.wav|what in like five minutes i'm not
data/017742.wav|the better dealerships car dealerships in general are a bad
data/000772.wav|each or something and just grab strangers and ask them if
data/031757.wav|why is this a link i want to
data/006701.wav|i literally overdid it for hulu the only thing
data/030886.wav|it's not the problem you're being
data/030111.wav|the tech and so you know i get the mic i i hold
data/008645.wav|where it's pretty reliable and that's why businesses
data/017931.wav|i would say like most things there's probably some things that are
data/013468.wav|tom holland zero dollars he was bullied in school for being a ballet dancer and also diagnosed
data/002982.wav|it's so genius no that was not the case
data/025152.wav|and they really went all in on luda
data/008535.wav|a very similar case to this where the ceo of tyson foods wanted to buy a meat processing company and then backed out at the last second with no real reason like after
data/026524.wav|that being said someone who i never liked is steve aoki who did this
data/024077.wav|and each one of those kitchens delivers food
data/020835.wav|the facebook tune in again next year for the return of marketing monday season
data/015556.wav|there are so profitable why not lose a little
data/027093.wav|inflation on the rise and should we be concerned about it well let me take that
data/004339.wav|but you know the difference is i think it's even funnier
data/025122.wav|at the marketing monday that is the
data/017865.wav|watch commercial no i didn't if you want to
data/002245.wav|their their way of making a splash is elon musk they may have elon musk build a cult of personality using company funds you know
data/007041.wav|what the us with no notches
data/025025.wav|and that's a lot of people who aren't part of like what you consider the gamer block that are always bitching about like star wars battlefront oh fast food
data/004797.wav|and let me tell you that's pretty much
data/029109.wav|two weeks before my start date they were like hey we're having a marketing like off site in tahoe
data/021647.wav|well it's a good little story so i think this
data/020821.wav|close second error oh there he said it at the end
data/008588.wav|twitter management did not want to take the deal but because
data/025900.wav|everyone clapped that you finally went
data/017343.wav|at the my paycheck my dad worked for amazon at a warehouse
data/018944.wav|mr chance the rapper mr the
data/015381.wav|it has been managed to punch with their weight
data/004539.wav|still typing it's not you think i would do this elaborate bit where i'm typing to
data/018400.wav|and here i am playing it for free
data/022799.wav|we're the right to spend 50 billion
data/013758.wav|there's still thriving and there was a leak this week that proves that blizzard has exactly what it takes to take back the crown and that's why my win this week is blizzard
data/004907.wav|the board of twitter started to like do everything possible to stop elon musk from getting a majority control of twitter
data/006069.wav|but turns out like i said the mobile rule applies mobas are always fun with friends when you're winning and we won twice and had a blast this was the best
data/032076.wav|flips open his laptop to the brightest setting and is trying to type up an entire roast
data/010072.wav|six seven months now um and when
data/001488.wav|now here's the question i'm mixing things up a bit here i'm going to ask a question that only i could possibly know
data/024664.wav|it's easy access to debt and the interest payments are very low once banks start to
data/007417.wav|but you can still go you can still go as
data/030122.wav|is the perfect example actually getting a
data/008794.wav|well i'm not gonna do it
data/009157.wav|are any of your highest viewed videos lower than a five out of ten i'm not sure what you're saying one out of ten
data/026578.wav|while this entire problem one is just having some filter of pr
data/028653.wav|comes in the door okay unlocks it looks
data/031400.wav|done good the fellas the fellas
data/025391.wav|way too expensive so now i'm
data/001607.wav|that's it thanks again for sponsoring my
data/014631.wav|so if they can just find a way to help use that superpower towards live
data/020332.wav|i think i'd probably give it a two and
data/005945.wav|with his pre-plan and then but they're having a good time
data/012247.wav|so i'm off doing other things me and
data/012483.wav|bro it's gone wow from the full immersion to gone sad spend five
data/009472.wav|or how little he'd played smite
data/012984.wav|i i think the whole concept of like splitting the day
data/011594.wav|and then i was like black and
data/023718.wav|this is look my only qualm with a lot of
data/019264.wav|how did they lose one thing I've noticed
data/016208.wav|see beer cat thank you for the prime
data/021641.wav|the casting choice of will ferrell is inspired just try to imagine anyone else but will ferrell and the
data/025203.wav|it'd be something that good that happened in
data/020808.wav|okay just read the words as written
data/014686.wav|i think at all what did it say
data/031890.wav|it's a little bit like i liked her
data/022032.wav|from brands the second one was the tsm tweet it was
data/020976.wav|see you guys han out here
data/003590.wav|whoa a penny in his penny videos it's just like that you get it software boom over
data/015466.wav|massive every family in america would need it okay everyone
data/010756.wav|give us one question from that exam and chat will all collectively give you an answer yeah and then one
data/010835.wav|it's serious i don't know about everyone else i
data/021099.wav|i think you guys put it
data/015710.wav|and hopefully we can do more with them in the future but please check them out if you would like it's in
data/031040.wav|the clean this like he wouldn't even walk in
data/008842.wav|the problem is he's you know he's already
data/007969.wav|one tomorrow i'm excited about it it'll be good
data/001989.wav|want to do it so there's no
data/030292.wav|one random chat or pay for everything like literally two weeks before the
data/031172.wav|i think that's the dopest thing is that he hit the record he wanted the record and he got it he's now
data/000832.wav|when did that happen and he's like oh yeah so i was a
data/031050.wav|i mean i don't know i don't
data/013150.wav|and i was trying to do it yeah if it works for
data/002092.wav|you have the card in your background oh is that
data/014995.wav|the only way to watch sports is
data/029204.wav|it was crazy twitch needed the ads like twitch needed that that many viewers watching ads is huge for twitch wouldn't he have gotten donuts or subs
data/032423.wav|we're using descending dark like me then you should avoid getting too close
data/018016.wav|but at the end of the night when i got home i literally
data/021174.wav|it's interesting and it's based in data so hopefully we can learn something from it i sort of organized
data/014997.wav|in the kept cable alive but now as people begin to shift
data/015297.wav|in billion so that's half of what netflix spent on content for the whole year
data/010628.wav|it's the yellow buff it does speed it's for the
data/012290.wav|it's fun and it's cool to be in the finals so
data/001626.wav|all the fun stuff i don't know what i should name it or title it daddy needed a new map that's not a good name that's not going to work the new hitman map is insane
data/017137.wav|we'll talk on apple maybe more than a little talk but it's
data/012579.wav|i still haven't gone through them all
data/001509.wav|way more affordable and healthy so check them out
data/024410.wav|inter of gaming that is powerful i am so excited for a world where i can walk around getting
data/016079.wav|fluid the next personal case study is on a channel i found called vacation
data/015310.wav|this this purchase is kind of crazy when you think about it this is a
data/004292.wav|and i'm sure it will reveal that i am correct
data/000461.wav|we have other plants so we all we all go back to the hotel room but i still want to be lt i'm obsessed with it all i wanted to we have other plans so we all we all go back to the hotel room but i still want
data/026516.wav|like an instinctual fear of getting further milked by gaming companies i think the last 10 years of gaming
data/010322.wav|i knew that when i asked chad i would get
data/019918.wav|suck it down and let me tell you something doing this now would get headlines but doing this back in
data/030061.wav|i am a young boy of seven years old i'm seven years old
data/000466.wav|and i'm rooming with nick allen where i
data/015409.wav|maybe the dvd would break and you'd buy frozen with the bonus features or they
data/030460.wav|so what i had done was and this is like i wanted to like
data/003038.wav|it's all want to say about that i just want to give you guys
data/001365.wav|if you're not you just don't tell me the truth
data/014872.wav|oh wait i actually wanted to give a win on that last subject
data/029563.wav|twitch hires two new people for smash
data/025104.wav|so i could see that i personally my
data/027343.wav|who wasn't talking to them who said that boss was hard i beat
data/006790.wav|i will say this uh i texted j
data/004557.wav|i need you to do what i've always
data/011898.wav|do it and for a penny and
data/010319.wav|the one game of fall guys
data/002297.wav|they're not faking their death they're gone for like weeks
data/004772.wav|i try this is tesla stock this is like tesla stock was
data/011380.wav|a man sounds weird stevie blunder is actually a great name it's a great
data/004231.wav|why not be but i got so many messages like that all throughout
data/020153.wav|i'll tell you why they're isolated from real communities working service jobs they hate while barely making ends meet
data/030932.wav|while the wall i'm sure they fixed it instantly but i definitely moved it over
data/025016.wav|well as and they're all negative and they're always like the developer but here's an example of one that would be classified as
data/002326.wav|we're going to watch somebody really funny oh
data/012628.wav|it's see the floor up there right you can't see
data/001032.wav|thoughts on the latest tft patch what you
data/000040.wav|the what life's about i've always said that your sub count is your is your happy count
data/024065.wav|i think the two takes i saw were like
data/006585.wav|you know solid pick that they were going to make
data/027582.wav|the million dollars last year it didn't make any profit at all
data/032014.wav|he would bail on everything with the with the excuse that he's too busy it would always be oh it's the kid
data/014469.wav|the advice that i gave him was that
data/005122.wav|you could take a bathroom break yeah
data/018326.wav|to go public the day you decide to do it
data/029129.wav|with area full of ledges that the player can't transcend
data/019064.wav|teachers oh my god parents and teachers i'm
data/031899.wav|what should i say i got this whole thing
data/026462.wav|the stuff here so in general i think
data/016090.wav|and i have their other social
data/009656.wav|ways we can still win and everyone else like doesn't want to tell ways we can still win and everyone else is like doesn't want to tell him dude it's
data/004750.wav|in for the whole company that's what he's going to
data/018322.wav|the share on on robinhood okay it's not public
data/018547.wav|and they have to get market share they have to they have to publish this game for
data/021105.wav|is are the pizza looking good that's what really matters
data/002030.wav|like it feels like we should get
data/007479.wav|if she thinks the bacon and eggs were going to be bad like
data/024970.wav|the defective sony product they got or
data/026450.wav|i don't have too many of them mango has a
data/003055.wav|i should have done that after
data/013508.wav|and they are so complete opposites stanz has so much negative
data/011946.wav|it's not everything's not crowded but the actors remember like everybody's
data/008643.wav|the rule of law between business to business
data/012976.wav|at the profession they people want to do it and so but like the
data/011389.wav|whether or not disney stole five
data/022939.wav|this is also very subtle at the end i don't think i've if you guys don't know epic also does unreal engine which is where a lot of games are based off of a lot of games are built on the unreal engine they suddenly say
data/028646.wav|i you're wondering where this the shirt comes in so now i have the moral high ground and i want to let albert know that i am better than him so
data/029389.wav|i just felt like i was out of it the
data/005169.wav|our life my nails when i really looked at
data/007511.wav|did he like it i think not but he didn't
data/009851.wav|events in america so you can't even build something like an apartment complex or a stadium or a school or anything without having like an equivalent number of
data/026286.wav|it'd be anything from a service or a product or
data/028241.wav|and then i bring this person in and they are like they're charming
data/013384.wav|if the pillow and just sleep it's actually fire i know i feel bad
data/030467.wav|why confusing like i really i wish that i had
data/004626.wav|and then obviously i diversify with some stance coin so if you want to just get a
data/003024.wav|or um there was a different theater where
data/005235.wav|so i get there and apparently i had like vip tickets ready at will call but i didn't know that so i'm with ari and i brought some of
data/024073.wav|restaurant design basically the taco bank with like vastly vastly expanded
data/001553.wav|nearly instantly oh bonus question bonus question
data/022031.wav|there was two terrible tweets this week
data/001346.wav|well it's paradise looks amazing triscuit thank
data/017093.wav|this is what like someone who just found out it's like what tommy
data/010473.wav|pretty vehemently opposed it because the nature and the dynamics of this sort of twisted
data/025483.wav|a lot of money i did a win

data/012851.wav|yeah i'd be on cbg academy or
data/009374.wav|you have these in my day these type of things
data/000608.wav|things like a story it's like a story of like a
data/002568.wav|if we flip this coin again and it's
data/004087.wav|big a do you think you could stream
data/001316.wav|i guess i never thought about it i've seen a couple of those primitive builds and i always thought who cares
data/016941.wav|into small percent return which is a way more
data/028168.wav|the crazily they hired a chief strategy officer named kai henry who makes a
data/003427.wav|the the situation it's it's the most dangerous thing we could possibly think of it's like so hopefully all all goes well and nothing happens and then we continue the status quo of it being like um
data/028380.wav|a busy so what you say is i'm really limited on
data/030012.wav|i didn't but i won't i'm not going to
data/020902.wav|yes you can buy a bunch of land and
data/021043.wav|lick your pants because you like
data/006031.wav|who was the teammates you remember i
data/025955.wav|they don't make a quick buck for them has led to this in this past week and that is a complete total collapse of blizzard stock market price
data/001074.wav|we know because the only thing
data/017052.wav|if you've made an impact on my life man how recently you
data/011616.wav|do one honeymoon which was sad
data/019625.wav|by king delroy a man that doesn't make
data/008742.wav|about how when he first approached
data/020433.wav|it's christmas in all of our hearts
data/031424.wav|if the it as an airbnb
data/001820.wav|big a what's your opinion on the the new
data/009469.wav|what we didn't lose because of seer sierra
data/011397.wav|no i didn't buy that i didn't buy that
data/010305.wav|as i'm not gonna ask him on
data/001269.wav|first things first saying hi to
data/009441.wav|this is a much better duelist
data/015506.wav|at the top of the list let's go to the very top and look at apple okay because while these guys are down here at
data/024362.wav|with a celebrity in this cost 13 plus million
data/029096.wav|at for baby rage because that baby would not shut the
data/013687.wav|he spent three fourths of his time being another ceo for square who owns
data/027690.wav|centers together to show you what an average Senator looks like this is what
data/003496.wav|there's like economic reasons but basically it's it was cheaper to make it in taiwan and so they got very good at it and the infrastructure to make chips is extremely expensive like you need
data/002728.wav|so if he loses right now he still lost
data/014316.wav|better tech and specifically the ability to rewind live broadcasts the ability to actually smoothly scrub through a live broadcast is a nuclear bomb of youtube side it loads better it loads smoother globally it has a seamless live experience if you
data/024171.wav|in the next like you don't know to not
data/002515.wav|so i need you to say the word
data/018916.wav|but he owned dreamworks when shrek was
data/021388.wav|at normal about gamestop what was not normal about gamestop what was not normal about gamestop
data/010809.wav|get the background like that would be it would be funny it would be an
data/007751.wav|and he thought he was faster than me
data/031262.wav|illegally in the mall of atlanta at
data/022041.wav|thought they were being clever and
data/024769.wav|in the payment information the friction for everything else that they're going to try
data/029434.wav|trying to make it in the gaming industry i'm
data/012864.wav|maybe well i think it was high
data/021856.wav|we've been really go up at all people might think this is all jeff basis is doing jeff bezos and is intelligent planning is the reason this all started to spike i'd like to point we've been really go up at all people might think this is all jeff bezos is doing jeff bezos and his intelligent planning
data/031567.wav|wave and somehow you add a second wave if you have a second wave
data/003622.wav|it yeah i mean it's it's
data/006239.wav|will be someone who is not on time okay i all i hold the line at
data/005728.wav|i get back in time but i really wanted to see i wish i i
data/029384.wav|and like you know that shouldn't be such a crime
data/022802.wav|let me set the stage it took place again at the height of the
data/028733.wav|browse for jobs or something and i see a message and it's like from a day ago and it's like yo you've been around we
data/031981.wav|and i'm so sorry to all of you about that two years before i'm friends with ludwig
data/003664.wav|you don't like then you know it it's fine in my mind obviously all their needs should be
data/001618.wav|that it'll help it's a it's your it's better than nothing but if your entire diet is like
data/008980.wav|if the in the bot argument which has as of now no evidence and also wouldn't matter with the contract
data/009558.wav|even when they win they lose because of
data/030176.wav|the the foot race which there is a video of but i think only ludwig has it on his
data/014787.wav|it and it's it's awesome it's a
data/008239.wav|run in politics is very unlikely i don't think
data/027160.wav|well actually not doing very much about it at all because if they actually do anything it's a collapse and on the other side of it if you look at even more zoomed out crazy lens this is the
data/000213.wav|where everyone can't figure out what to order or they order something stupid and
data/012474.wav|is so like even when it's all over i go back to my
data/004304.wav|it's like i am quiet i am i can you can hear me
data/021259.wav|the most desired product on the face of the planet we also have the
data/014118.wav|it's a very small group of people and they're already rich but if you were one of those people you made a lot more of what you were worth
data/029943.wav|i popped off so hard that that that person turned to me and was like
data/005453.wav|i have the same jacket it's nice yeah
data/021574.wav|don't have so i don't know exactly how they did it but essentially like you want to buy carrots from me okay so i show you this one
data/017297.wav|on this blessed of days winnie the pooh
data/028605.wav|the whole thing was a disaster i quit
data/008557.wav|many accounts on twitter are bots one of every 20 things you see
data/024737.wav|triple a game that took a studio hundreds of millions
data/029432.wav|i wanna talk to you again because like he really liked me this guy
data/003562.wav|also where it seems more powerful which it does when you're
data/029078.wav|twitch staff or early games or early streamers
data/024899.wav|the to get that lazy slow but smart part of your brain to wake up our brain hates using system 2. system
data/000650.wav|it was the second we got them uh so
data/019971.wav|and he was ceo of pixar crazy
data/019354.wav|minus 12 million dollars on research and
data/015907.wav|work no matter what prices are going up because right now it's
data/012190.wav|the show up here i'm already the latest person so i call ari and i'm like ari please get down there please ari we need you
data/024001.wav|seeing stars this is their chance to break the monopoly the other cold take
data/029771.wav|if you win singles or doubles you get a mug of beer
data/006561.wav|speaking of huge companies that are no longer
data/016628.wav|of them were in the last 20 years
data/027986.wav|at the movies and film there
data/032399.wav|it was it was required basically he said to get past this
data/011542.wav|did you see the tweet that was like grey's anatomy is white women's one piece
data/002126.wav|in the democrats formed new third u.s political
data/019402.wav|i said he'd never seen the castle before this is in the game the game gave you this castle in the alps which was such a flex dude
data/019369.wav|does an absurd amount of money i
data/005887.wav|the basketball so first he asked who's the best basketball player and they were like
data/030676.wav|some ice cream because my dad barely even knew there
data/010888.wav|for feeding it only encourages me to carry
data/002948.wav|wasn't much left it was crazy i mean it was like wow they just they totally left out any kind of
data/021142.wav|a little babies ice cream and nobody knows you you have to break through
data/005384.wav|to that we'll get to streamers and being socially awkward in in a minute there's there's a lot to say i think they're cool by the way i think they're cool again
data/000152.wav|the cousins we had to cut from the list because we haven't i mean
data/028745.wav|by the way he never ever made it out of
data/026368.wav|the becoming deeply embedded in the apple ecosystem and buying again uh genius bar
data/011247.wav|at it and it sounded like a really i was
data/012833.wav|going to be great and then it turns out that
data/018091.wav|i think that's crazy had to make an emergency
data/029217.wav|in-person tasks for team liquid there was a big um starcraft tournament and liquid hero
data/029579.wav|well yeah it's like oh well if
data/000303.wav|it's really fun and i was catching up i
data/004316.wav|i got a little bonus uh video thing at the
data/027815.wav|with the question you guys are asking a lot of people are asking this and in fact i
data/014704.wav|or or like a really fancy dress you know whatever
data/028034.wav|actually an awesome thing and good for workers rights but
data/030062.wav|in april okay so i was six turning seven but i was six years old i read the nintendo power and i realized that hey you pikachu is
data/000525.wav|like i guess it's the first half of claire
data/003246.wav|harry potter back when there was only one book
data/024117.wav|because the primary demographic of tv watchers is like
data/011273.wav|man i miss the ghost look at
data/005243.wav|i want to tell this story with a little
data/019998.wav|this is but i'll try to explain
data/001515.wav|all right i'm having this uh
data/007794.wav|yeah or i take off a dream mask
data/010372.wav|i takes us you know i went live on time
data/019459.wav|tell me the lyrics right now something about a nickel
data/003939.wav|once again we all write in morbius universal
data/015398.wav|amazon prime or they are afraid of doing this like disney disney's afraid of doing this because obviously they make a ton of money from
data/031798.wav|of entirely new audience to twitch
data/004005.wav|somebody let's look at the list
data/016593.wav|so that employees are less likely to get hacked on the job and they raised
data/023778.wav|i'm going to give it a try
data/006774.wav|i think i think you got i think my
data/007852.wav|if of tupac shakur i was work it was good
data/010522.wav|was she was on my team because she's she's a killer out there she's a killer out there on the field but you know it is i know
data/026753.wav|at the monopoly directly it would reduce two players to one that being said there are a lot of companies that are still on the table so i put together this how does sony bounce back well let me tell you when industries enter periods of
data/025105.wav|my number one based on things that i've seen is comcast comcast and generally
data/023707.wav|i can't help you i can't help you it's that that i thought it was fake too but it's got
data/012521.wav|you'd probably have a blast i think you'd probably have a blast i think some people did that and i think they had a great time because the actors never turned you down they never they never like don't banter with you
data/029750.wav|that's what i want to know yeah my assumption is like
data/022768.wav|that it would go down and so when it did go down because he couldn't sell it he made money off that he basically knew instantly and he used that to get a billion dollars join the trace commerce club
data/004701.wav|i'm not sure that's the best solution it is a
data/025920.wav|it didn't make a big show of force and then the second
data/029982.wav|just a little different this is like a this is
data/025349.wav|wait that's one of the reasons i got picked i
data/022352.wav|ingredient the kind you could read
data/010680.wav|through the boss and nobody wants to
data/005613.wav|long one clip i just said everyone choosing
data/009589.wav|does led play league in his free time
data/024041.wav|coke sales were going down pepsi was going up and then they came out with new coke and
data/001610.wav|we learned something that is the criteria
data/025847.wav|giving them a chance to go off and make a movie instead went with this and ended up with
data/004883.wav|basically behave and maybe not incorrectly that the rules do not apply to him that that rules that apply to other
data/007808.wav|we're gonna do that today regardless
data/016895.wav|and uh and so people that are involved
data/019382.wav|or older brands so we we kept releasing new brands
data/017055.wav|at the videos they binge them
data/021882.wav|in this photo this is patrick
data/027846.wav|i wonder how many of these companies you think are entering the space just
data/030205.wav|monty matches at one point even after he got rich we had to stop he lost so much money that after he got rich it was nearing over a thousand dollars
data/004636.wav|if he didn't even say nvidia right he was like in in
data/021850.wav|he ended up buying twitch instead and basically planting his balls across seattle
data/021467.wav|which was so cool which was so cool was that people were so disgusted and so unanimous in their anger like they did a million
data/022002.wav|in this that i see in a lot of marketing
data/015108.wav|this is from chief content officer ted serrandos i've mentioned this
data/020393.wav|make the brother the present yeah we'll have the parents die and then we'll have the two brothers stare in each other's eyes and call each
data/004784.wav|to say that he was so shocked so so insanely shocked at the number of bots that were at twitter that it was a material breach of the agreement that he had already signed and
data/005643.wav|you know i like i remember thinking
data/015768.wav|there you go yeah exactly so they haven't even
data/003517.wav|as happened in some form before and the
data/003295.wav|because it's now over two hundred dollars for a family of four it's getting too expensive and if you don't like baseball like i don't we can save money by not going
data/012160.wav|it was so dark oh i felt so bad
data/030741.wav|it's a factory farm what is
data/009922.wav|i swear to god dude i feel like i'm so
data/024314.wav|it had a lot of problems with this line i
data/008126.wav|and i think ludwig as someone who's also a very extremely privileged white person would probably want to donate to the cause so i'm just
data/009587.wav|and there is no doubt in my mind
data/019583.wav|wentworth and because the phone number has cash now in it it has a call to action and what they do
data/026190.wav|league every one of their games is
data/025430.wav|in your spare time hello from paris did i
data/004120.wav|how bad i'm just saying in an alternate world it could have and i want you guys to think about that all right this is a
data/011163.wav|she also likes my pit stains wait who's sitting over there who is sit who's sitting off stream
data/022632.wav|i have a shot at it
data/020323.wav|i need i need that as an alert i need i need that sound bite as a sub
data/021203.wav|is there are looking for i think they're
data/020698.wav|i remember is how filthy disgusting this burger was why would you ever want to go to burger king after you see this
data/019097.wav|and technological solution to bridge that gap you can almost
data/011195.wav|a streamer okay yeah yes sir as streaming works forever everyone knows that he was always work out life a streamer okay yeah yes sir and streaming works forever everyone knows that
data/031776.wav|what might have happened with the final four episodes that sounds amazing
data/024326.wav|incredibly hard to do we're now down to the top three the top three most expensive ads of all time get ready
data/032081.wav|and i hope your petition to bring back
data/024017.wav|i don't pay out that's when things go
data/006265.wav|i know she just doesn't like me to show the food even though i think it's very delicious
data/018685.wav|the xbox series s and the
data/024136.wav|we're all the support and love over all these years it's time for the next big thing of my career the future
data/007073.wav|you know this stream will be dead
data/030127.wav|where i'm still a kid that loves the game the next day my dad comes down
data/018753.wav|and so all those previous theories were like totally wrong and it turns out everyone's fine paying absurd amounts of money for the phone as long as they can flex on their
data/029079.wav|the getting hired at twitch and
data/020317.wav|there for the filming of this i was i was off camera i'm i'm
data/013146.wav|it'd be a problem dude it's
data/031577.wav|you start to hear it like wait
data/012964.wav|we don't want to have to pay back all that debt just makes you grind
data/030895.wav|and i usually only need to take one glass and i usually when i get acid reflux i'm like oh it's because i haven't pooped in
data/018556.wav|if the value dick now i think the real winner on both
data/011924.wav|want to tell you exactly what happens in
data/027562.wav|if people got a little concerned because uh
data/005109.wav|to cure me of clint stephen syndrome and then what they did is they had me play offline smite with clint last night and it turns out close proximity to clint stevens finally cured my disease and gave me
data/026540.wav|your image next up we have now i think a lot of you have been bitten by the
data/023360.wav|but fanboys will be happy so
data/018303.wav|i just the car to get you from
data/014432.wav|it can be very powerful and so they want to win this war same with cloud gaming when
data/031298.wav|back to bite me the next day we are headed to the convention center a pack of us me the president i think five other members of our team behind me we're all walking and we i get a little thirsty i'll be honest with you i'm getting a little thirsty i'm a little
data/003262.wav|but in your stupid example even if we really wanted
data/023188.wav|candy if you see made with real fruit assume that this is candy fruit roll-ups is candy when you look at the ingredients it's very obvious that it's mostly just sugar
data/008204.wav|get me in a room with kevin and that's going to grow
data/003722.wav|there's there's been a ton of like pressure
data/021562.wav|there are short positions don't unwind
data/004019.wav|i felt this guy woke up
data/010430.wav|you to four thousand chatters who are all
data/026364.wav|for and use images of martin luther king and
data/011933.wav|this is the guy lieutenant croy this guy
data/001586.wav|you'll have to take a guess what are you thinking number
data/009530.wav|what the problem with witchcraft is
data/022128.wav|is pretty dystopian but that guy's a little more
data/030196.wav|and i will say probably one of the most impressive things i've ever seen from him he
data/025432.wav|this is not a powerful moment
data/026322.wav|it's to make these luxury nice high-end
data/008349.wav|and you get a bunch of cool new stuff and so
data/014014.wav|so you know we live and learn on that one i which means i will be wearing probably eight to ten sigma tanks at once layered to the gym which will be cool i think
data/031731.wav|this is what dewey looks like one of
data/007709.wav|actually genius yes that makes so much sense
data/026476.wav|what about drivers for all companies but nvidia drivers are generally better generally easier to use
data/029828.wav|in your head you kid in college
data/024046.wav|that genius was that a genius nine head
data/026498.wav|years now there hasn't been a single scam a single rug
data/016519.wav|in the world of esports was quake 2 for 34 i
data/003193.wav|but we can follow that up with an easy win and that is uh second chances okay second chances
data/010719.wav|make business expenses to go to lower tax rate yeah i mean true you should do
data/011811.wav|they are like they're not like the the teenagers you know what i'm saying they are like into it like like
data/021076.wav|so who's the target market for condoms
data/025256.wav|keegan michael key as toad here's a clip
data/008599.wav|if the legal team he looks this contract he reads it through he agrees he shakes hands
data/025630.wav|sales way up though profit was declining because they're spending all the money
data/032083.wav|that actually uploaded that infamous vod of
data/029655.wav|when he was like explain he's getting ready
data/020503.wav|what a what a reputation they have this was my brilliant summary look at this look at this why is cyberpunk dead on arrival wow look at that look at that that's called production
data/002274.wav|came back from the dead today
data/013729.wav|some repercussions as we spend more and more of our time online a world where everything is
data/006489.wav|spending up a storm on credit
data/023624.wav|really slathering it on as a gamer should if any of that interests you new customers can get
data/015947.wav|and the competition is fierce why would you
data/024203.wav|if the viewer base they have
data/012785.wav|i could invent things that koreans have
data/028182.wav|but anyway that's my that's my mini deep

data/007022.wav|literally like one to one it matches
data/032231.wav|at the way when he was walking back
data/008140.wav|which is a supreme court some sort of
data/006704.wav|and i said it's no problem i said
data/008182.wav|i wish that were true if only we lived in a world where minions day was every day but that's not the case that being said i will be eating another one of those meals because there was a hamburger

data/019162.wav|i didn't like it was kids at the beginning all playing games on different
data/017519.wav|and and into a bigger topic do you guys remember when i did the three lines marketing monday anyone remember it wasn't my most popular marketing monday but it was an interesting one it was about a way of thinking about marketing uh
data/032355.wav|the fairly difficult achievement but lying about
data/004463.wav|in the good way or cold like the food is cold because it's
data/023144.wav|better than any other field because you're already going to be hungry okay the
data/027158.wav|i won't work either because everyone's so mad about inflation that it looks like the democrats are about to get absolutely
data/001108.wav|with the club for it uh that's
data/004222.wav|it's just like there's the amount
data/020999.wav|the whole point of their business is that you think your job sucks you want to find a new job you go to
data/000390.wav|the french place and when we're doing it halfway through germa shows up
data/003495.wav|why isn't there any other chip providers
data/026678.wav|and pay blizzard for these rights so twitch was like okay how do we make this money back and it was things like this okay watching overwatch
data/028158.wav|what the may just be bank or they just be
data/009800.wav|germany is importing more goods than
data/027267.wav|are turning out that that stuff wasn't affecting consumer protection it wasn't hurting their brand what this study found was that low brand image is much more damaging than low brand quality and they do things differently they have different show ribs their shrubs look look much more high quality they don't do tv advertising there's no that are turning out that that stuff wasn't affecting consumer perception it wasn't hurting their brand what this study found was that low brand image is much more damaging than low brand quality and
data/019772.wav|up here let's get to the top 10 most
data/003296.wav|i that's pretty much a win
data/016618.wav|cliff almost over the entire world where
data/029406.wav|that's around here she did that she didn't even ask questions
data/014827.wav|if they're calling it the great exodus
data/024986.wav|actually one of the best preachers of how strong
data/010129.wav|to have known you for just a brief moment in these ever branching paths called life
data/019516.wav|until it wasn't a foot and then people measured it and sued
data/011243.wav|every corner of this house there's one on the
data/009369.wav|from the lcs i'm the analyst now uh taking
data/012393.wav|we've i've helped my bad guys she's up
data/018211.wav|i don't always get a dna test now the
data/007325.wav|we like gutted i feel like i got punched in the gut dude i feel like i got punched
data/004634.wav|anyway i got one today and
data/006903.wav|and i made no money when i started a
data/020036.wav|we're not going to recognize but i actually had to
data/001611.wav|the world of youtube to get to the bottom of it
data/018343.wav|crooked working at a startup i
data/019452.wav|but i see a wheaties ad and then later
data/006309.wav|i was like a fantastic video
data/018132.wav|exhausted people are collapsing because they can't refresh themselves
data/009542.wav|so he has the legal right to say my team
data/029956.wav|what already he didn't raid i think he saw i think he
data/001499.wav|i'm pretty sure your favorite color is green
data/019448.wav|but i rarely buy anything in the ads so to
data/029892.wav|and we're sitting next to a fence and
data/019422.wav|there's so many commercials that are
data/031928.wav|and i don't know why we thought that was appropriate to do right next to all of our friends and again i'm not that kind of person but so so we were doing that okay so
data/001711.wav|the character as he appears in the original
data/012711.wav|are a normals league player you could probably
data/023073.wav|the get it okay so marketing is not going to affect very much what i buy
data/014276.wav|i think they could i mean they could
data/031859.wav|was a fad that was not
data/031086.wav|it's because he set his goals at the
data/031831.wav|amaranth are the most likely to watch nasa which proves that she did not cheat
data/012487.wav|as was like glad go again you're right you know what let's do
data/031709.wav|at the subreddit is the second result now that being said
data/005614.wav|isn't that show don't like hate him in my chat
data/028159.wav|the big question here is what are they spending the money on how are they spending 80 million dollars and i looked
data/012953.wav|so if you're saying is there any worth in it i probably would not do it like if you're doing grad school
data/016321.wav|well you guys weren't around for uncle
data/005495.wav|i had like half a truly and everyone
data/018210.wav|wake up in the morning and
data/015680.wav|next year so all the discovery stuff
data/014372.wav|it drops are a great way to drive attention viewership interest in a game
data/014516.wav|i'm proud of him it blows my mind would i ever leave
data/024719.wav|over the course of your life it'll go up right now the federal government is just printing money to keep this artificially high
data/012668.wav|aspect video popped up yeah i saw that
data/004154.wav|well over a year ago you purchased a fedora for the nice guy undertale run
data/030655.wav|i clutch a couple more all
data/009898.wav|a little slice of life story really
data/028962.wav|my debit card and i have no money and i can't take out
data/000966.wav|what he's like i've seen movies like i've seen i've seen american movies you're
data/025443.wav|it's ad was terrible but i liked it more than the pepsi one because they mentioned gamers and i'm a gamer so i feel heard and
data/028230.wav|but we hire both because they both crush the interview
data/004609.wav|this whole chart and talk about it all
data/006700.wav|of times i never showed youtube once it was only gameplay and then when i finally got it after six hours i did a hulu plug
data/012306.wav|i put my heart in the game
data/011546.wav|is pretty cringe and there's good anime but i've never met an anime profile picture that i thought had good takes
data/029341.wav|i try to like put the jacket off but underneath the jacket i have like a
data/014941.wav|i think yeah they're up branded alerts
data/011450.wav|but what that means is interesting topics of discussion are limited to one or two days a week
data/019185.wav|the speed the speed and then right around
data/023053.wav|i have as much money and at which point when they've lost the ability to like you know make a bunch of money
data/005193.wav|the new name formerly known as jesse mccree
data/000693.wav|in the in the middle of the thing and like there's different kitchens and
data/023117.wav|so what they've been doing this is only one of many many names is they have legally found almost any other name they could put on the label other than high fructose corn syrup i've found 10 they'll call it
data/008187.wav|and i got i got a pretty heavy gaming
data/018710.wav|winning the console war is not even worth microsoft's time they're thinking bigger so they realized
data/023324.wav|he recognized us and then he offhandedly said oh yeah i made safe
data/023419.wav|are your 30s actually your prime
data/006504.wav|but on the other flip side this is
data/029046.wav|he doesn't know that i had anything
data/028266.wav|king nightmare i mean it was like the it was like the
data/016475.wav|it is not to praise him it is talk about a story that is often told about jeff
data/013419.wav|cause one of the lights is out yeah and i get it i don't know if it's worth
data/016410.wav|i go deeply into it but it's called the
data/016938.wav|which is an amoral business model this one is uh
data/019077.wav|commerce projects these are all designed to sell more products i i do not think
data/017126.wav|thank you for your 12 months oh

data/004206.wav|i do really appreciate it thank you
data/023929.wav|the content i just say this is funny but what he can do is literally like make
data/032427.wav|if the the gatekeeping is a disease
data/006694.wav|no hulu you didn't pay for this
data/016006.wav|and every other company when you say that they're like
data/024197.wav|do we really need to outbid on tim the
data/005345.wav|maybe ludwig's running on the stage
data/014783.wav|don't then it's not really this is like this is mostly for people who are
data/015403.wav|in chance in this war they were kind of on the way out to be quite honest um and
data/016212.wav|you don't have to update me i know this is marketing monday i know

data/003033.wav|there was no victim at the theater that that that we found out about

data/029145.wav|golden treasure i was so excited i
data/003245.wav|a publicly traded company where individuals could buy stock in it and as the franchise grows these stocks become more valuable if this were the case someone who purchased

data/012596.wav|tell you what i'm doing i'm just putting a little
data/018681.wav|us they lost everywhere everywhere bought more ps force then xbox once microsoft is nervous going into this next generation they gotta get this they lost everywhere everywhere bought more ps4s than
data/020346.wav|a five i think four or five i mean look if it's not a five it's only because
data/004490.wav|it's like you know it's like think about why shaq is likable you
data/025995.wav|they thought the best way to deliver that campaign on social was to tweet try
data/001332.wav|amber out of a makeshift banana if you can
data/028273.wav|worked there he had been fired thank god because i go
data/024814.wav|get crazy that's where they are really taking advantage of the skinner box nature of our minds this is a video
data/025838.wav|made the timothy olyphant hitman had never even seen the game bro the way he acts and
data/000292.wav|with the sweet is that um
data/008724.wav|dude it's something it's a it's a word that means that it had a massive impact not a small but a massive impact on twitter's business and they've basically been
data/017321.wav|human history there's not been um a private
data/029187.wav|the commencement of what became known as the start nine
data/002042.wav|if you have crucifix earrings are you more or less religious what is that
data/000365.wav|whatever it is teams are not stacked
data/003080.wav|i don't think they've gotten extra dark i think that the world is just crashing now economically
data/007309.wav|they kept coming back and they started
data/023464.wav|to explain the difference in strategies with perceived value with the three lines
data/019002.wav|she's had a backstory we can talk about
data/002358.wav|it's to rsvp i'll take the steak thanks you
data/027037.wav|a pretty good pretty good pretty fun guy
data/009849.wav|that hold way more people than
data/008927.wav|with the thing that i wanted to mention
data/009777.wav|living in germany expecting oh dude
data/008479.wav|but i would bet on you i don't i don't agree with your the way you say it but if i was a betting man i think you could take them as well
data/025536.wav|is that they are eventually ending the cycle of the switch and they don't have a good
data/008068.wav|i wouldn't necessarily say we are basically brothers
data/002124.wav|what of people saying copium no shot no way
data/013932.wav|owed money exactly on time with no missed payments
data/019368.wav|i ran the quarter six gambit i spent on everything i spent all night not playing league for once and i looked at what every competitor was doing in every market and i tried to buy better
data/029804.wav|if the for sweet and i remember you know you weren't really
data/013118.wav|and it said if you wake up early every day and and work out your life will change
data/012847.wav|a year i mean a year plus i
data/017795.wav|or and you're spamming it and you're
data/012482.wav|text messages can i still open that data
data/026558.wav|the the website is for like 30 million dollars right now
data/021097.wav|a punch like at all at all like not even like the
data/015561.wav|these guys but i'm going to i want
data/004021.wav|the grinder they're a degenerate stay
data/008763.wav|i don't want to buy this company do you know
data/026788.wav|sort of thought about acquiring or
data/003593.wav|so that that era that like
data/012821.wav|it's just all my friends and family i was
data/001199.wav|one is eight factor i would be very very very
data/030738.wav|what else would it be i drop
data/009155.wav|i just bought it it's on a massive like nine
data/011823.wav|i like the eight full-time character actors
data/014437.wav|in the next few years is going to
data/018610.wav|or consoles if they make this exclusive people will buy xbox for it and so why wouldn't they yeah now
data/003181.wav|and youtube and everything but it's killing facebook first and foremost and so
data/002273.wav|his next album i think he waited a long time but yes if
data/023932.wav|and then my final dub and this is a marketing monday after all goes to a man who
data/017288.wav|like anyone with a big wireless plan
data/002734.wav|done nothing of value there is people who have made brilliant songs from my stream that
data/013526.wav|my boyfriend forced me to play smash
data/004887.wav|billionaire friendly he's the richest man on earth he has a lot of power behind him to possibly make this a reality but it's not infinite and i i find it hard to believe he will be able to get out of this twitter deal without a significant financial harm
data/018134.wav|wait what pepsi owns the government
data/030288.wav|right now and happily use it again we must eliminate the stigma around dog shampoo to further society that's the two of us see the bomb you and me well who else will join
data/027224.wav|it came out the same time it has an entirely
data/020754.wav|later this year a lawsuit filed by over
data/020840.wav|what you need to be looking at is a king called tommy in it
data/024573.wav|where they tried here's why epics lost so you
data/011330.wav|it's all in just for a little bit thank
data/016676.wav|all that stuff is is is climbing if you are somebody who thinks you have a
data/019712.wav|okay i'll do the fail first because it's
data/015387.wav|this was the big innovation this is what this is what made
data/009891.wav|ten years like it's been it's been uh
data/024919.wav|you've already put time or money into something you
data/025749.wav|i didn't watch that i didn't watch it ahead of time i was wondering what could it possibly be to have this
data/018772.wav|okay it's just it's just too smart not to the elder scrolls six announcement
data/019920.wav|it's caused not only was it an incredibly incredibly generic shooter with terrible ai by the way someone said he kind of did though he did kind of make everyone who
data/002743.wav|i need the money what does that mean what do you mean i you
data/017337.wav|they create jobs for and they can start to put pressure on local and state governments to get massive concessions on things like taxes and and uh factory building
data/028236.wav|even though he's way different than i thought he was he's actually way more funny and
data/028880.wav|throw up right here i feel terrible this is this is this is no good so they took the other 10 and they poured
data/015871.wav|why would disney plus make a bundle with netflix they just won't do it
data/014063.wav|there are that and they're not
data/016228.wav|with the prime king delroy let's see if we got it
data/003906.wav|the that the democratic side um
data/020361.wav|i was going to put it as a four or five it's great great great
data/003122.wav|wait for fang but not higher than average
data/003073.wav|the have reflected you know we talk about marketing and business and in all of
data/009719.wav|people it's not it's not presenting the right look
data/018224.wav|that a lot of marketers fall
data/024002.wav|is that this was all a
data/016431.wav|in general it is majority wealthy
data/013719.wav|and they've just gone about their business nothing happens okay this guy kept making accounts kept getting banned from
data/014206.wav|well if you encounter video is way bigger
data/016696.wav|and these are investments that will be extremely important they seem they seem
data/023633.wav|as in the lgbtq community but now now that
data/022247.wav|well i don't even know if
data/016171.wav|it's like it just feels like a better way to get exercise you know
data/000680.wav|in japan she studied abroad there um
data/011452.wav|gen z in china has got it just as bad as
data/013753.wav|if you guys know marketing monday you may know that i put out one of my favorite
data/008624.wav|if the team and i don't like elon musk so there's a good chance that both of them
data/030554.wav|if on his face when he
data/006340.wav|if the two months attaro again
data/015091.wav|netflix is losing stars play over
data/031368.wav|overarching theme is that i am a
data/003655.wav|but it's not going to be because
data/020845.wav|that's all i'm trying to do so this is a thread by nick
data/021272.wav|like the star of twitch lately getting around
data/019007.wav|very long at all and a lot of female
data/005190.wav|on a called cassidy i met cole cassidy i met carl cassidy
data/023609.wav|siphoning all of their money like he pays himself like a
data/002845.wav|ruled on in the past she has a
data/015990.wav|i think about it i'm if i sign up for netflix and pay what
data/008519.wav|although if they do force them to go
data/022996.wav|is one of the most profitable things in the history of technology it literally prints money because you
data/031067.wav|a signing bonus i had money but he was
data/024891.wav|you don't complete the mission or whatever they don't give you those items they'll show them to you and say you've earned
data/002607.wav|nobody has won today is insane
data/027183.wav|if branding but first a little bit of background elton ring just dropped last
data/011566.wav|or said yes this will be my new aesthetic and music taste now
data/017088.wav|slime and then this photo is from literally like four years ago he just went back in his
data/024222.wav|we didn't know how much they cost now we know how much they cost
data/020837.wav|ninja from fortnite any advice this is
data/008259.wav|in there and you can join find
data/015049.wav|so they realized okay our business doesn't make sense for the long term
data/018689.wav|knows the difference okay so early on xbox
data/016240.wav|got wins and fails wins and
data/030863.wav|snap out of the simulation quick that's a funny theory it's
data/006040.wav|seaward even though use it every third word
data/007016.wav|and i said i like sour candy i did it live
data/012551.wav|harry potter would farm money i think it
data/000047.wav|with the nine months waffle surfing the
data/023994.wav|starting october 1st okay and that's
data/019429.wav|it's not like you can pick any of these you have to have number one it's like saying your commercial can be
data/005790.wav|i go to the bathroom go out then
data/008959.wav|from no matter what i think he just made a really dumb buy i think
data/022153.wav|ads that are emotional much more likely
data/019781.wav|is that we normally on they added things scripted that
data/007013.wav|it was kind of hype it was kind of a
data/027104.wav|to be worried about specifically when it comes to growth stocks right now
data/012738.wav|with the you put the time in not even you don't have to get better
data/001990.wav|well they wouldn't be too different you know
data/021504.wav|because they have to get it down or they're losing billions and losing billions is people will kill for that i mean they'll do anything what does it mean people
data/023721.wav|or know like if they just threw a sprite at
data/028306.wav|he would he's like literally like a
data/026402.wav|as rewards so overall in some you can sort
data/012425.wav|with the i wanted to show you
data/017435.wav|is that are cool are long gone
data/006647.wav|heard that i a obviously it's a short-term that i i i might squeeze the blues but to heard that i a obviously it's a short-term today hey obviously it's a short stream today
data/013234.wav|the the internet we'd lose our mind
data/013987.wav|is there to help you or make things easier and often they lead you to spend now they do they do work in terms of if you are a merchant for example if i was trying to sell my merch on
data/018070.wav|i i'm pretty sure it didn't pretty
data/006314.wav|he reached out about a video he said he liked or something and then i
data/006372.wav|no way to get your money back
data/020069.wav|as are all right every time you guessed it for all
data/029347.wav|it was nice place right off the lot it's where
data/013136.wav|i was talking about this with a riot employee
data/013158.wav|it's the oh a hit is relative it could
data/004361.wav|i don't want to move on i want you to feel a lot of attention on it
data/020776.wav|dude many of them right here on this very show
data/031596.wav|i convinced my parents to let me fly to sweden to go to
data/000994.wav|they stopped doing that that means it's available to take
data/028956.wav|well i've been told i haven't told
data/013506.wav|actually that's also true that's also true it's funny you know it's funny
data/006012.wav|it's the practice a lot so i was like that must
data/008824.wav|can be real i was talking with a co-worker today
data/028462.wav|while in germany so this kid has been like shipped off from somewhere in america
data/004340.wav|will be able to stop laughing the
data/020660.wav|i thought this is genius this is

data/031834.wav|it's been the guy that's just
data/002800.wav|anime profile picture my financial planning is not perfect

data/020445.wav|or if you're like most people you've consumed all your cyberpunk news in formats like this giant yellow squares with small black text on them now normally this would mean delays but instead they dropped one to say dear gamers first of all we want to apologize you for not showing the game on base last gen

data/031950.wav|the next day at school or i think
data/017305.wav|something might have gone wrong in
data/018449.wav|if microsoft microsoft doesn't care about
data/022439.wav|in the world and they did this ad for years and it's like oh i don't need to be too clever i just
data/022888.wav|the background just so they can break
data/026342.wav|isn't that extra amount of money on apple products and you notice the the diff difference
data/007388.wav|that's my that's my experience he really he's a he's a character but
data/024594.wav|important character was free to be himself to be the banana man he always
data/005668.wav|because i learned about streamers and i'm gonna
data/004870.wav|they should pretend to work somewhere else
data/020447.wav|you know i want to dive into that because now they're offering refunds for the
data/018368.wav|what it means is that some other human being sees your work as valuable and
data/002741.wav|up again i mean that i'm sorry
data/001211.wav|and you want to get started marketing but don't want to go to college for a marketing degree then that's more interesting uh it's
data/014055.wav|take months to make a product that was bad seeing auto create something like that
data/018639.wav|so we'll see how that plays out but
data/012004.wav|which i think i have a video let me see if i have a video i tried to sneak it but like when they're in there it feels weird
data/018574.wav|alex when they lose and listen here's the most important thing if there's one thing you take away from all this it's this
data/029520.wav|doc and i love what he's doing and it's great but it isn't it
data/022403.wav|as it's already over geico 15 minutes could save you
data/016178.wav|to this marketing monday an event that sells
data/028647.wav|bright and early and i truck it down to a store called the diamond supply co in downtown sf and i'm sitting there at the door and it's locked and it's not open yet and i find that it opens at
data/029593.wav|little different facets of things from each other
data/024380.wav|that money went the main things i can
data/005538.wav|but mom and dad a lot oh yeah dude and then also some people there were drunk at the family gathering and they were people in my extended family who weren't invited my wedding
data/023702.wav|well that's super funny do you like playing pokemon would you like to play pokemon go around
data/026638.wav|i want to show you one more thing let me show you the value of microsoft as a company you'll notice you can't even see anything else this gigantic 60 billion dollar activision
data/027839.wav|worry more cash every quarter like it's getting worse and now owing a lot of money is really a bad a very expensive
data/021297.wav|the graph twitch viewership has tripled
data/026673.wav|because it was so obvious to me like
data/031840.wav|pink is italian wow it literally looks like italy the italian streamers literally look like the boot of italy on the island of twitch that is cosmic fate
data/028066.wav|i don't get it so every cd you guys
data/006221.wav|jump into the wins and fails i'm excited
data/012935.wav|crushing every other part of marketing like traditional tv ads useless uh banner ads pretty useless
data/026019.wav|it's the day where classic works entered the public domain
data/019533.wav|that's almost better because it's quick that's quick and memorable i think the first one's a better
data/026332.wav|or in-person purchase experience and this
data/002709.wav|to walk away but if you don't take this deal
data/016984.wav|actually it was pretty interesting but i want to
data/019798.wav|the hype for the game was so much that legendary pictures the the people that made
data/007001.wav|and everyone was really nice and
data/003305.wav|it's a recession but i have a win for you i have a win we are not in a recession
data/024452.wav|it caused a lot of bad pr they got sued and they also got sued before that for like being 11 inches and everything they said
data/010380.wav|oh god it's the witness oh no i'm really
data/006124.wav|that being emotionally charged and incredibly close definitely pushed him
data/004617.wav|did you pay the required subs i know you're a subscriber
data/007834.wav|was lost but you should drop a
data/017117.wav|yo a truck my family started calling me
data/022381.wav|it feels like i can't even see the ground it's weird
data/027003.wav|big celebrities it's hard to win by picking a bigger celebrity and getting more celebrities and getting more colorful and more song and dance i
data/012083.wav|and so you started to see him over and
data/031226.wav|the day one comes i enter my competitions i'm doing well i
data/027624.wav|it got one bad review and they demanded that amazon
data/022583.wav|in the gaming to a deeper level
data/000849.wav|i rising he's a child that grew up
data/000333.wav|though like you turn your gun to a chainsaw and you can it's cool
data/005114.wav|to be honest it's not a bad idea i'm not saying that i deserve a whole month
data/001507.wav|in the past i'm going to say like three months like of this year ordering food has gotten out of control bonanza is expensive
data/012159.wav|what a different team in charge of that that
data/024279.wav|while british villains and this one also cost eight million dollars
data/009703.wav|it feels great hey there pal
data/022786.wav|are you so they bought countrywide for two billion dollars and that seems cheap at the time everyone's like wow what a great deal why was countrywide willing to sell for only two billion they're making money hand over fist two billion dollars is nothing this is a great deal for most
data/029211.wav|they don't do that imagine people
data/001643.wav|one second flat they're like something just
data/001231.wav|can you tell factor to make a pad thai option the only thing i tell factor is to send me more strawberry banana
data/015043.wav|two things that i've encompassed in this
data/023059.wav|if you believe in the cause maybe consider dusting off the old keyboard pulling out the controller and buying a couple
data/014334.wav|the greatest business quotes ever in
data/025219.wav|cause we're going to buy it and
data/030209.wav|that was after he got rich
data/014157.wav|but still good to go to youtube lupo tend the
data/028985.wav|i've never gone more than a day without eating right pretty much ever i don't
data/030366.wav|and i don't have time to
data/026826.wav|and everyone's got an opinion and i want to hear
data/016947.wav|so you don't feel like you have
data/019582.wav|or heads but it has the the brand name
data/007410.wav|i walk around this tournament you know i know i know people i know a lot of the faces but there's a ton of new people there's a ton of slippy kids that are coming up
data/019365.wav|and i got this warning i took a screenshot of it your firm's independent auditor has noted you intend to spend 12 million dollars on new
data/029918.wav|was the first time it was like we i remember standing at that gas station pumping gas
data/013618.wav|i clipped quite a few things that
data/002227.wav|get options on the pizza on the free pizza or something like that it was
data/013167.wav|from now on i'm gonna do what i call responding it's different it's
data/029524.wav|we'd all of them but then you actually go and look at the people ranked
data/023967.wav|but it is talk about how dumb they are like why would they do
data/008844.wav|in the court case it's it's it's very unprecedented i think i think him walking away without paying twitter any money is extremely low unless he's
data/009422.wav|it's the best worst worst champion it's
data/031724.wav|the find the like one of the producers or yeah okay
data/011591.wav|my opinion was i kind of wish they didn't use black and white for the last like eight episodes of better call saul not that it was i i loved it i thought
data/014724.wav|obviously that wasn't good obviously that
data/026760.wav|and this will be announced i think relatively soon
data/016390.wav|i listen this is not like a political segment i
data/031217.wav|but i also knew that the teachers and the adults that ran
data/011529.wav|on youtube oh maybe so mad
data/011422.wav|do owe me quite a bit more than 25
data/003684.wav|how would you fix that i mean the biggest way
data/026283.wav|when that happens before you buy the item purchase
data/018065.wav|if the original pepsi man oh time
data/019355.wav|in development costs by the way i overrode both my partners
data/004792.wav|is committed to closing the transaction on
data/028144.wav|in revenue and then loses 80 million on
data/010279.wav|you are very playful is the thing wow
data/032211.wav|at night and it starts out innocently enough we're winning
data/028922.wav|this girl was like carrying me and i was like like it was
data/018903.wav|with episodes that can be played on your phone now let me show you again you might have seen it in their ad but
data/016308.wav|back injuries strains sprains repetitive stress injuries and more you can get them four times as likely
data/025048.wav|greatness and then getting on social media being like i was so disappointed
data/031670.wav|it's a little bit i'm all
data/030293.wav|if the wedding i'll run on marby's
data/030901.wav|board games are fun what was that
data/027616.wav|whatever direction he takes in mass fires whatever he does you're gonna have
data/019738.wav|well it's really a fail on our
data/002874.wav|leave the delaware supreme court at which point
data/006420.wav|obsidian ore playing crypto crush saga a
data/005789.wav|i want to know i want to
data/021604.wav|the hell is going on if you just count tom brady in his
data/004423.wav|i mean we're sending a date i think we're gonna go for saturday
data/008237.wav|didn't have deep deep deep deeply entrenched corporate interests on both sides
data/024459.wav|we couldn't fit it in one commercial and i'm gonna just give you one example and you're
data/024344.wav|well dysfunction pill geico would never do this geico always reinforces that you can save money
data/028124.wav|what's called a spec a special purpose acquisition corporation which is where a company is already listed and they just merge with you and then you take the name so it would be a boring company
data/003336.wav|so we'll see i mean that could collapse the
data/003759.wav|what incentive do politicians have to
data/022303.wav|let me tell you something if you have
data/025014.wav|so here's an example i i did some research here i
data/006602.wav|i just need to make sure that i have
data/010233.wav|if he did some kind of
data/029112.wav|as we are there as we are in tahoe twitch facebook one starts to happen
data/025804.wav|where somebody asked the question who's better rider
data/021909.wav|i don't have a quote here but in the book and in what i learned about
data/022113.wav|the prime example of that is sunny d tweeting i can't do this anymore
data/003992.wav|as to people too much i don't have
data/005415.wav|if i check the paypal stubs
data/018219.wav|the creative idea it's a creative idea
data/020774.wav|the next award goes to the single greatest
data/019094.wav|the the cost problem v tubers really solves the problem of
data/030058.wav|the most knowledgeable and he does probably have what was your
data/018957.wav|when you're watching a crap show a show you put on to pass the time a show that you know isn't citizen kane or
data/017557.wav|of their company beats even mainstays like coca-cola disney
data/024363.wav|in dollars probably for a million reshoots and a lot of
data/015030.wav|one one business day you'll get three delivered to your house keep them as long as you want without late fees for soccer finish one return it in this prepaid envelope
data/025769.wav|blizzard a storied one going back to all
data/013173.wav|i live in pakistan are you currently in pakistan it's
data/010338.wav|i don't think that's a leak
data/015760.wav|free trial abusing churning and it just feels like no one can really get a foothold that's dominant outside of netflix so the rest of the world's where it's at
data/012432.wav|oh this is the bar you can see
data/017875.wav|there are monopolies they spend the money to like most of what they spend the money you to seem like less there are monopolies they spend the money to like most of what they spend the money unless it seems like less of an evil company
data/005067.wav|then right sexual misconduct left and right and receiving no consequences at all i don't
data/016848.wav|predicting all i know is that ai is a massive massive force that is going to change so many things
data/017942.wav|well programs yeah lots of programs is an
data/029230.wav|with the open the curtain for him
data/012385.wav|i didn't like kids found everything
data/022577.wav|with too far well actually too
data/008805.wav|a while ago i thought the back out fee like most people was like hey if either party gets cold feet and
data/027863.wav|i understand why bad companies are going down but why are good
data/024521.wav|the crime so every time she said yeah it
data/016472.wav|welcome to marketing monday today's topic 20 or so
data/011565.wav|is entirely based on that movie
data/003358.wav|an eye on and it's it's not a win
data/015159.wav|the telecom companies were suing netflix because they didn't expect to have to actually deliver unlimited broadband to their customers everyone was watching
data/029707.wav|so you don't think you want any
data/029949.wav|well yeah watch watch tomorrow everybody
data/026807.wav|is growing like crazy it's funny that apple made this whole thing about privacy and like it's all about privacy but they just created their own ad business which is blowing up growing like crazy and they're using all the data themselves but they've blocked facebook out so tim cook just sort of kicked
data/015595.wav|tough sell it cheaply and make
data/010478.wav|so there's actually no way to avoid it
data/008648.wav|with twitter in some way and make elon
data/005751.wav|he gets more and more dangerous as the meter fills he starts
data/029745.wav|in the front row every single time he's puppet master
data/009997.wav|i don't want to be a bully
data/002388.wav|that we're gonna wake up at 6
data/015731.wav|what what everyone is starting to run into is that people just sign up for a service watch exactly one show during a free trial and then quit that i
data/010037.wav|i got a bunch of fun auditions and really cool stuff coming
data/005609.wav|smash community ee cheated on schooled
data/018701.wav|what is worth a hundred and fifty
data/013640.wav|membership feels like too much of a commitment
data/020867.wav|of california i'm not for all of it but in general a lot of it is like i just
data/014084.wav|why did drop this tweet this is our one defense
data/005488.wav|my first thought was like wow i can't believe she talks like that for real because my brain didn't even connect the dots that it could possibly be related to my stream i can't believe someone actually says excuse me for real that's crazy
data/019169.wav|good you have to find a way to be somehow stand out or be distinct otherwise people just generally people by default will go to whatever this the bigger one is copying the marketing even if there's a slightly better is not the way
data/002574.wav|i have six dollars to my name is that enough for
data/017421.wav|number two increased social media presence means doing things like going to a party and getting while drunk can
data/028433.wav|hair so yeah i was badass
data/001921.wav|is the only reason you keep your
data/030444.wav|beach but there's like a lot of people around all right it's
data/018938.wav|they clearly just thought if we throw money at this problem what could fail but that's not the only problem all right i think the main problem because again what they basically did and let me
data/007011.wav|he didn't just get me a random
data/000441.wav|oh i remember what happened as i remember what happened
data/022657.wav|we studied for his math test
data/027997.wav|i have to be if they were like we can't we actually can't let's give a
data/023344.wav|because literally okay look he's not
data/013068.wav|the guy who left his job at animation lead at nickelodeon because he got kids
data/020406.wav|why why when he's buying the oreo
data/010757.wav|it was really good very glad you enjoyed it i think
data/029517.wav|i think the overall narrative of this this whole doc is like how the five gods came to be how they fell what you know like
data/016362.wav|trillion dollars in pandemic assistance for struggling americans small businesses and
data/022071.wav|and that's like basically what we would tweet on
data/012177.wav|and i wake up and it's like the first
data/024425.wav|i actually think maybe it's in the it might be in the replies yeah there's this lion one
data/031700.wav|go into his anime brain and realize
data/004615.wav|erected every goddamn song you think i
data/032256.wav|and i'm like what is it you know like we
data/017935.wav|you know it's very easy to just be a shitty team and get your cut of the nfl
data/007395.wav|want to play the game to know like that that
data/018230.wav|standard kind of lowish example of trying to do this cross promotion kind of thing after this next one i'll have an idea
data/011934.wav|is the best actor in the whole thing this guy is the most committed he is literally like
data/016688.wav|rather than design and that is why you might see this the apple car is almost all but confirmed this is not what it'll look like i don't think but based on leaks from apple they are
data/013793.wav|at a human in real life that is so
data/019069.wav|dealing with depression in a fake way and then i remembered in the shower today wait a minute i've fallen for this before like this is something i've fallen for and i realized that i love bojack horseman bojack horseman's twitter is entirely in
data/030033.wav|the be able to do little
data/028556.wav|if the taxes or did you sell any
data/023946.wav|it's just really smart and that's my final dub
data/031693.wav|it's beautiful i watched it in the original
data/024163.wav|or died he did one stream on youtube and one stream
data/004691.wav|anyway i hope you guys are
data/013981.wav|it seems like a smart guy but basically he said things like we're in the we are past like the era of debt okay we are in the
data/013660.wav|what the mixture logo is dog i'll have him
data/012685.wav|put out first and then i can go do some more
data/006885.wav|it was like the peak of like but it
data/011000.wav|they actually told me this is not working so i need to crop
data/015075.wav|their stock is already worth like massive
data/030325.wav|is the place to be the cancun is the spot dude great music
data/007334.wav|at be on that so it was the easiest bet i
data/001733.wav|get there because they don't have it
data/029056.wav|in whatever like he just he it was
data/020424.wav|it's so simple humble beginnings indeed humble beginnings this is an example of every every pepsi
data/016315.wav|muscle and joint injuries wow just number one across the board
data/000555.wav|the of money i think how much were they i mean i don't want to i think it's
data/010585.wav|okay okay and does it work
data/024186.wav|to me i know the normal sizes
data/023458.wav|you can raise this and then you can get fat margins okay now the second part of this is market share the difference between price and perceived value and
data/018239.wav|why did they hire the devil to play the child that was an interesting choice why get damien from the omen
data/022265.wav|work and insurance company compared to a taiwan how do they handle
data/029966.wav|well this is the perfect time to type
data/016329.wav|speaking of guys they keep taking w's
data/032051.wav|in the bobby's commentary that's my favorite of my jokes his products make twitch so much money every month they almost
data/031448.wav|this is just a plastic football it's like it's like a nerf ball stance gets back out bro and
data/015778.wav|and eventually the main thing is that for the longest time
data/010114.wav|like i should sound crystal can someone
data/012362.wav|and you get off the galaxy's edge
data/025670.wav|either things happened one when there
data/024477.wav|well imprint upon your brain and so i'm
data/012476.wav|like they just assume that we've learned a valuable lesson and they're like buddy buddy like
data/010654.wav|which class and again i have
data/013345.wav|but i wouldn't lie to you that's the
data/016267.wav|injured a bunch but just one so yeah i just
data/026823.wav|in the world of marketing it is the one day of the entire year where the average person cares about watching ads
data/004208.wav|today i want to let you know that i love your content so much and i can't wait to make
data/001127.wav|they look at some memes and laugh
data/018586.wav|is and sony's starting to realize i think
data/009321.wav|watch people that went there and she went there anime expo
data/009925.wav|like i'm talking about it too much sometimes

data/008700.wav|that they knew it was higher and then
data/026222.wav|that is more than the number of people in that age group that are afraid of war or death they are more afraid of credit card debt than dying as a generation and theoretically if you pay
data/029542.wav|way down we road trip from norcal
data/018205.wav|pronounced okay so every other car

data/024607.wav|this is an easy win it's called fashion
data/001602.wav|to be quite convenient and good uh legitimate thing for most people i
data/019283.wav|in my mind to put Halo which is
data/025763.wav|it's in fun memorable good ad
data/022339.wav|wondering what's going on and a friend figures it
data/009598.wav|even though it's a beautiful esport and i love the international nobody
data/026307.wav|and in fact led them to their three trillion
data/021724.wav|experts read the comments let me see the massive plow differently beam because chick traditionally trap
data/003733.wav|the are scared of that they try to i think i think they want us to be apathetic because then we don't do anything
data/028889.wav|i'm not drunk right now yeah i had
data/000802.wav|in wallet so he gives me all his cash back and this what i realized is the
data/002637.wav|but i you know we have to stick to the rules of the game otherwise
data/018935.wav|any kind of knowledge about what
data/018366.wav|there's just a few things that would help make it perfect
data/005702.wav|we're talking i mentioned to hassan
data/024962.wav|most hated brand in every country
data/027024.wav|hell yeah brother god damn it
data/012561.wav|in november of last year i sold a bunch of amazon a bunch of nvidia a bunch of sony a bunch of i sold almost everything but my my like i sold neo i saw a
data/025490.wav|i those four all of which you've
data/024855.wav|it's very important filling up meters bars now let me explain how you make money from all
data/016356.wav|and essentially it is about how the uh
data/020666.wav|old episodes of video game high school for six hours straight every day monday
data/003319.wav|which is actually a good thing let me give a a
data/008409.wav|add up my title game i realized because
data/017908.wav|go back to the go back to the clock model
data/025602.wav|wins in a row because i'm a positive person so if you guys know the big five tech companies for the first probably like the
data/027384.wav|now getting an official sonic the hedgehog game backed by sega called sonic speed simulator roblox gets a cut of this
data/013076.wav|yeah i heard people people in college would always be watching those or for computer science
data/028156.wav|is doing that very quickly because of this deal falling through unless they find a way to
data/025573.wav|i thought of me the first win is me
data/007420.wav|and because you know that none was trying to act out of that let's see
data/016413.wav|i don't remember what century exactly it was
data/013886.wav|know people like it i'm just being real here i didn't really
data/010074.wav|i want i want to give them free advertising after they but they
data/029575.wav|what the game i know it's so
data/007519.wav|just joining there was a guy at the tournament who grabbed my arm and said yo coffee cow and gave me a
data/008110.wav|it'd be live you know i wouldn't be used to be live you know it wouldn't be
data/030664.wav|in lake so i write it down lake baikal
data/032072.wav|dude figure it out and so i had to room with
data/003877.wav|i keep seeing articles that trump is
data/031116.wav|i was seven he'd never done it
data/000669.wav|and then stands would give him you know two thousand dollars and
data/008573.wav|big twitter is not a well-run
data/025873.wav|there's a bug in the game and he wants to like
data/009060.wav|wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute
data/019048.wav|a perfect model the secret to good skin is love the secret to good skin that's the secret to your good skin seraphine is it love
data/004734.wav|we're experienced and as of today it has been confirmed that he is doing everything he can legally do to get out of buying twitter he is tossing in the towel
data/004801.wav|it's actually more stringent than it appears it does not
data/008080.wav|during black history month would be
data/027089.wav|is one of the best investors in history pretty old but he has one of the best track records in history
data/027970.wav|the heroes over at babylon's fall
data/009516.wav|it's a simple band mister b's told lubbock it's a simple ban mr beast told ludwig not to practice
data/019670.wav|the meetings and stuff like that so i do like
data/009236.wav|i think it's a pretty common razor scooter phenomenon but i just see i have a memory because i was in arizona
data/012794.wav|he'd always say we got this late you know it was annoying but he would do it
data/030862.wav|i'm currently in the trenches of world war ii and need air support
data/004811.wav|it was and financing no longer secured in the same way it's gonna be really awkward for him financially now all in the same time
data/004546.wav|seems kind of goofy and i was like
data/007727.wav|that's the part that's weird uh users
data/031281.wav|going to call the police i really really really like turn on everything i've got in all of my
data/032080.wav|we had months we had months in advance to write it by the way but thank you for the intro
data/004871.wav|seems like a lot of the world is especially you know
data/030303.wav|man you know what i'm saying will you have melee set up to the reception
data/015422.wav|okay making disney a fearsome competitor you could in fact
data/000062.wav|the her bachelor party it's just my bachelor
data/026833.wav|if every time you watch a ad
data/005463.wav|i don't know why everyone took these
data/020003.wav|i could do the halo example but again this was 30 million to
data/006318.wav|guy and it feels kind of shitty i
data/022683.wav|mimi's and tumblr got it and yahoo wanted a piece
data/010325.wav|is that when i ask you for help you take it seriously you don't just turn it into one big goof and i appreciate that you don't just
data/019897.wav|it's a decent game if it was like a tech demo it's fun i played
data/018967.wav|too much pressure for a zoomer even if it's only for 10 minutes
data/014794.wav|we will be doing a couple
data/004387.wav|speaking of twitter that i got a dm today that just made me
data/014842.wav|was their mind and now they're removing it because fans
data/022104.wav|with a customer's name awesome job
data/024548.wav|isn't there there's even a debate
data/016736.wav|from the first one i had back in
data/000197.wav|some reason he's the guy who
data/003209.wav|what it's called uh dramatically diminished
data/031558.wav|the force of tanks and turrets and marines
data/015513.wav|this is apple in the streaming wars it's like a hobby to them they're the most valuable company on
data/011708.wav|eventually we got through to her after
data/015370.wav|for each emmy they received netflix made about
data/002885.wav|an interesting situation where his best incentive would be to do that and so i'll be watching very closely this is all happening quite quickly
data/018684.wav|this is already flopped this is over so this plan has failed i should have a sidebar here where i say
data/008524.wav|at four months hey man i noticed my twitch
data/011056.wav|to know why you're ending a seven year friendship by the way can i be honest with you outside of
data/029426.wav|of uh universal he's like yo so
data/005875.wav|not be able to cosplay but you should come with me
data/031166.wav|don't donate if you can't afford it
data/029349.wav|or whatever and he's like let's all go all right and i'm like cool cool and i'm like assuming in my mind he's
data/013841.wav|what is going on they'll change their mind when they realize where their money came from like microsoft the most valuable company on planet earth is going to lose a couple
data/003775.wav|have called joe manchin twice now and it's
data/023622.wav|the important part my fiance likes it here's proof okay
data/018261.wav|now if they do in toyota's commercial
data/017633.wav|touch points for the first time you get to interact and touch a new apple
data/006727.wav|asked me to sign something for someone on her team i believe and i i did sign a hoodie which was cool i started so
data/005496.wav|one else is gone dude everyone else
data/023855.wav|released a new coke replacing the classic coke formula and the outcry was immense everyone was angry and terrified and mad
data/009700.wav|and so when they call me butt it makes
data/024403.wav|fails starting with my first fail
data/027521.wav|what did they they went from 140 characters
data/024978.wav|finland hates ferrari i guess they are kind of like
data/012813.wav|which is the the nationwide college league of legends
data/018953.wav|all the stars weren't big enough oh the
data/014807.wav|but until then we need to get into the actual content so
data/014572.wav|well look here's the thing here's one thing i want to say to everybody about every industry ever you don't want one side to win being a fanboy is the stupidest thing you could ever do if youtube wins this war
data/031300.wav|is everyone's hungry or thirsty or wants a snack let's
data/016467.wav|oh my god it couldn't be more appropriate
data/023335.wav|and i know that it's been a long time coming but i just mean i think we're really starting to see within the past year or two that the democratization of the internet into all these different hyper niches create sort of micro celebrities with still massive massive value because they can capture attention in ways that
data/005414.wav|that's right now i'm sure you're making out all right
data/011786.wav|into a room that i guess either was an elevator or
data/026320.wav|on someone else's terms it would be on a verizon terms best buys terms
data/017582.wav|it's still is very good at this section of the clock but other companies have
data/014361.wav|what i'm saying there's a there's there's things in other countries that have really built this out china's very
data/016937.wav|as an extremely clean easy to use interface what makes it different is that it does not sell information on your trades to hedge funds which is what the one that most people know does
data/021621.wav|i promise i will not eat any more of your friends really
data/026330.wav|nine million dollars nine to twelve million dollars opening a new store verizon spends four hundred thousand a
data/016398.wav|that are in the middle of all three and they have not benefited the average person very much at all there are very very few cases there are cases that exist of small businesses that got the
data/007843.wav|it's more of a work shirt
data/017033.wav|i make sense that makes sense that makes
data/010063.wav|we are able to get smarter at all zoomers are unable to learn
data/002367.wav|i actually bought a new one but i did not install it
data/019724.wav|we changed they have not it's not like it's the iphone versus the a giant
data/012881.wav|it is expensive you know what i'm saying
data/005944.wav|it was definitely salty so he
data/002268.wav|we can sneak in a little cat for the
data/021430.wav|mr sums of money for the knowledge of what the
data/007375.wav|way tournaments and there's a simple binary
data/011588.wav|i think something and then someone i think is
data/011562.wav|thank you finally someone said it
data/013602.wav|i actually had a headache before i went live today and i was like you know what
data/022856.wav|they recommend to the public if you should buy or sell or hold a stock and they looked at all of his recommendations they realized
data/031849.wav|the king of the league community
data/012908.wav|this is before blizzard's total meltdown
data/017986.wav|it's up to like three now
data/029791.wav|because whenever i first met you
data/001309.wav|i watched a really great video i'm sure everyone's seen it now
data/032019.wav|in from being a podcast host to being a successful podcast
data/010009.wav|it is very funny it's not funny actually it's bullying is what it is my editor who was who edited that video was
data/003750.wav|go to jail and so when you make an actual crime
data/003797.wav|do the right thing because they're not
data/013010.wav|after you need all teachers to be active on

data/020659.wav|i am just floored and i'm just i'm just stunned the way he says take it to the house kid while riding a tractor for no reason as a professional gamer that they somehow got an nfl
data/005560.wav|they like they had to slow down to go
data/000834.wav|yeah he's like yeah and then one day i decided i would hire a bunch of people in my fake family

data/025587.wav|is still he his hand hasn't left the top of
data/002527.wav|it's easy clap i would advise you to even but you could push your luck and go for
data/012246.wav|so i'm furious but it's fine
data/018765.wav|if the considered higher end and bought by families with
data/016778.wav|i have so much money i'm gonna

data/016414.wav|whoever is closest to those in power when money is when new money is printed that causes inflation
data/006530.wav|i was a different story and actually there's a great article
data/030548.wav|it's in there and he's all alone and
data/027914.wav|or twice as bad and getting worse at least you can make your money back by
data/015208.wav|in these countries and you can make stuff way cheaper this is where netflix's key competitive advantage going forward is this is how they again time after time
data/022921.wav|however cross-platform play is not a slam dunk no matter the size of the title basically saying don't get
data/009810.wav|well like everyone's going through it
data/026202.wav|i had to watch it on stanz's tv which
data/029422.wav|he hit me with the elon musk dude anyway
data/012504.wav|it's like whatever it's not it's i'm not hurting for it but if i think about it from a rational person which i do about money i just think about it like
data/026812.wav|a massive drop in the amount of advertisers wanting to spend on facebook
data/002998.wav|and they start prickling up and everyone's
data/005760.wav|like quick quick jokes just chatting always keep
data/017196.wav|if any monday on time ever again
data/024068.wav|we've got a lot of things
data/020791.wav|we came back from the impossible
data/016288.wav|i just want the goddamn game you know what's funny
data/026789.wav|because a lot of bad things are happening for them all at once recently number one it's called
data/025575.wav|was that i've never ever gotten a prediction wrong and that is what makes me a genius
data/019515.wav|it lowered the link they made the bread a little shorter till it wasn't a foot and it lowered the length they made the bread a little shorter
data/004742.wav|twitter has tremendous potential i look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it this was april
data/009029.wav|do you really want to trust your future on what
data/023157.wav|i twitter fingers you know this burger looks pretty delicious right i think
data/007040.wav|it i asked for no notches it has perfect
data/023299.wav|and i think a large part of it was due to coke's great response coke actually
data/020112.wav|to become a two trillion dollar company
data/022746.wav|google thought that the phones they were
data/006465.wav|indicator that could have been used to figure out if
data/005330.wav|i got there and he walks up and he goes hey can i get a picture with
data/012356.wav|which is the planet where galaxy's edge is based so the ship lands and you get in like an
data/001859.wav|to get a date that we
data/020401.wav|worker whatever it takes i don't care if
data/012686.wav|we're going to have your life ruined when the riot mmo
data/020270.wav|as best one is worst that is one of my favorite pepsi ads i've ever seen
data/019972.wav|pixar movies now make about a billion dollars a year but the rough estimate is that for every billion dollars you make at a box office at disney you're making two times that on merchant theme parks there's there's more money in the toys so they make about three billion dollars per movie
data/015663.wav|it the most effective to their business
data/009741.wav|it was actually a really fun movie but the plot is so ridiculous it's set in like
data/019454.wav|i want wheaties to be one of the choices we don't keep very many choices in
data/016417.wav|they can tell you effect means and so when a
data/031862.wav|but the player base new players young players are not picking up
data/019736.wav|can i say that you're a computer
data/001914.wav|the privilege of being my editor so i get
data/008247.wav|get a career and opportunity at twitch uh
data/006122.wav|the stream previously that he was gonna
data/021249.wav|the xbox i could tell you about how even if they're both sold out the ebay
data/022646.wav|true now you can sit back and let ron do the arguing for you
data/021543.wav|which means they sell more which creates a loop where the entire
data/015787.wav|and those are just basically niche services
data/018630.wav|the streaming they could have you end to end you'd log on you'd watch your favorite streamer on mixer you could click in right into the cloud
data/020023.wav|it's worth about 50 billion right now
data/010606.wav|i must be an angel i must be above reproach when it comes to my vocabulary and i need
data/030796.wav|it's era eminem bar i don't even know the song but i can
data/009384.wav|what have you try to triple ban out double lift
data/021397.wav|of the big short and he saw that gamestop was making about the same amount of revenue as chewy but worth amazingly less and he's like wow this stock is undervalued ryan cohen i'm sorry
data/019893.wav|the meaningless okay let's get to number two this game is actually good
data/005085.wav|let's see what the best tweets of the june and july basically
data/024945.wav|do you guys remember that video
data/006431.wav|past two weeks grinding for better weapons
data/003257.wav|and turn it into profit and what i love is the idea that a book that's already been scouted and published and is on
data/028393.wav|his stream okay we might act globally but we think globally okay remember that
data/012975.wav|and like if you look at a country like norway or something they pay teachers way better it's
data/010526.wav|put pressure on the stream right i understand that
data/001663.wav|wow factor where did wow factor go where did my factor
data/031835.wav|in this area to become the absolute dominant force of the hype
data/018775.wav|it's coming eventually it was embarrassing but they had to announce something to get people excited again and the real
data/001641.wav|walking time and they can wall
data/013935.wav|but if you were to miss any of your
data/011018.wav|if the for you all the time
data/022336.wav|and then every day after that a major
data/021862.wav|in the league of legends or valorenter
data/010030.wav|that's such a weird thing to say if i'm talking to the camera i

data/001978.wav|you could build a waffle brand
data/031139.wav|it was when he said he
data/013741.wav|much into it but i think people that are obsessed with
data/021120.wav|well we could bridge the age gap
data/030616.wav|was that cool or did it suck well before
data/005116.wav|actually i streamed on july 1st with the
data/022136.wav|i once was working late on one of these emails and i had to write the emails
data/025333.wav|every now and then what is this nutter butter squid game this squid game that we want nut game

data/006836.wav|what he had the record we congratulated him a while ago but he beat his own record by a full like minute so
data/022695.wav|that number was completely pulled out of
data/014414.wav|it's doable why don't they that's what they
data/012662.wav|it was pretty fun i know that connor played he
data/024684.wav|everything is going to go down even safe
data/019376.wav|once we started to take the lead and we got closer to the
data/001883.wav|it was just fun interesting questions
data/017912.wav|are quiet theater and nothing there's nothing here it's over it's
data/012618.wav|when i showed up and they

data/011928.wav|right off the rip storm troopers
data/001818.wav|i'm like a god if it was called living gods
data/012183.wav|is a bunch of people in there everyone that
data/006993.wav|before i get to that what did i want to say
data/005227.wav|want to get to that okay let's start
data/023535.wav|it is unique there is no there's no product like the iphone that sells as many as it does and still has the high perceived value how do monopoly sustain themselves
data/029424.wav|i totally forgot there was a purpose this story i told you like
data/017500.wav|that i'm wrong you know what the sega ceo was right when he said
data/007048.wav|it is one day before hitler which is not great not not perfect but not the same day tim curry
data/002121.wav|we might see the biggest number of
data/015874.wav|they're not going to agree to do it
data/024088.wav|was actually the goat of pioneering
data/020446.wav|and not allowing you to make a more informed decisions about your purchase
data/004946.wav|it's right there's too many bots the contract is no one void
data/019080.wav|to sell product which has always been
data/014142.wav|the ship and take their audience with them
data/016367.wav|or from the federal government allegedly claiming he had
data/021583.wav|with gamestop right now okay they said okay let me borrow you they sold gamestop
data/016230.wav|it's crazy how hard that goes the whole
data/017885.wav|are the most important parts of the clock i think pre-purchase has gotten too much
data/005957.wav|you can see hbox is about to pop
data/029259.wav|add people that were just saying all sorts of crazy things
data/028098.wav|it's actually so crazy how on edge every investor there is at any government action it's the amount of control they have over the market is is insane and as an alibaba investor wow
data/016001.wav|to raise prices what's stopping every other company from going massively into debt to do the same thing is that your question they kind of
data/010014.wav|pays a mod now so better watch out watch your steps have you seen his song about school
data/013494.wav|league of legends i would always be like one more game and
data/013270.wav|the line up no i don't think he did do that if you haven't seen invincible you need
data/031337.wav|it was really the nicest thing i remember that probably to this
data/027668.wav|and until you have a billion tomatoes and then you're a billionaire you sell those
data/026735.wav|with reason the fourth reason is the
data/029498.wav|i just like a bunch of
data/029587.wav|talked about how you felt from zayn like he was
data/010171.wav|and you wouldn't feel this be authentic
data/006996.wav|genesis was the first event that i have been to
data/020233.wav|the for further updates and then just delete
data/000496.wav|because in my mind germa has
data/011818.wav|obviously not everybody they're talking to
data/015829.wav|we are going to get their news from assange
data/004229.wav|it's like all right you all
data/000623.wav|baby the i'm over talking to your but it may me
data/022898.wav|it does anything on it and they don't allow you to do any other payment
data/029392.wav|whatever i had a good day at
data/025742.wav|the very good commercials manage to do the
data/021257.wav|i worked on the face of the planet we also have
data/002073.wav|in the hand you know like

data/031916.wav|well private room almost like like a square
data/006181.wav|and i told him because it was a knockoff that
data/003418.wav|again it would lead to more defenses on the taiwan mainland and the real battle that's happening right now is for
data/002742.wav|in a new answer from you a hundred and i
data/009525.wav|they mess up the positioning knowing where to be knowing to watch the mini-map knowing how to get to fights on
data/025154.wav|his popularity was like peaked in 2002
data/018623.wav|okay the first year they did this they
data/020798.wav|get involved in any serious conversation without being like
data/016386.wav|that everyone got is a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of
data/001593.wav|what are we doing now we are jumping into get
data/019019.wav|social media for those days paying for them to
data/022266.wav|if the world with my best friend
data/020121.wav|let's see that this video was sponsored by raid shadow legends as your first mistake in the early twenty teams brands will only just finding let's see that this video is sponsored by raid shadow legends
data/015627.wav|so if you don't have good originals you can't keep growing the
data/005305.wav|tell this point you know they
data/015441.wav|the only billion dollar movie it's a it's phenomenally successful again red notice
data/011998.wav|and a lot of the devil's
data/016052.wav|said the whole market my only advice
data/016014.wav|no one wants to lose money no one wants
data/004306.wav|what's wrong with the dangle you got a problem with
data/031077.wav|if viewers but you could tell that he was
data/030010.wav|as do you think we i would not go there no
data/022955.wav|made nine billion dollars in revenue off of basically just fortnight battle
data/032049.wav|rob you look like someone put
data/012569.wav|and so i when i log on and check it it's
data/025600.wav|and his company in charge of our social interaction big win for humans
data/024192.wav|on where this uh stream wars goes because
data/007784.wav|but when we see it we'll see it
data/014360.wav|which is a pretty whack experience or let's say you're like a beauty youtuber who
data/016623.wav|know this but i think some stats are pretty stark i think it's
data/004315.wav|we got a special guest appearance for a
data/005533.wav|quit balling i started working at twitch and then all my friends became gamer nerds
data/020613.wav|no it isn't it couldn't be
data/029806.wav|and you know i kind of like looked up to you as like
data/027873.wav|how would a recession reset things so
data/003627.wav|i didn't like it just it just it just makes little financial sense especially if you're like in the same town as your parents to move you know
data/001623.wav|how do you guys think i should
data/027634.wav|we tried to cash out 40 billion dollars of
data/030813.wav|and i was just like wait i can do this i
data/002177.wav|my panel liked basketball and so i brought
data/022249.wav|i commercial i'm not ready for something as sad as a thai commercial
data/013740.wav|i always think it's kind of comical that
data/007724.wav|been months of glizzing and glurketing
data/016777.wav|just a twitch boomer okay wait till i i'm
data/031315.wav|good thing is a sting operation the second i try to leave the door
data/011678.wav|i know star wars trivia i know star wars but i'm not like i've never been the pers the type of nerd that i am is a
data/007311.wav|if the level kid one of them was like probably i
data/020515.wav|which means of course there was no footage of the massive amount of bugs let me say one more thing not to put too much of my own self into this but i have worked on a project marketing related with
data/022259.wav|why make some of you cry even harder for different reasons
data/013481.wav|girlfriend is crying me an empath i'm sensing that you want me to go play playstation for
data/008454.wav|sat down and played with grasslaw
data/028155.wav|we are able to cut costs they could survive but if they don't cut costs and they don't find new funding faze clan will actually go bankrupt
data/016419.wav|rarely to fraudsters and rich people they get to buy the houses they get to buy the
data/020869.wav|construction costs are insane because of hurricane codes vacant land doesn't exist property
data/018312.wav|get exactly what it's about it sounds like you just saw an ad on the internet and said
data/005625.wav|i stood out in the dms but we hadn't spoken and
data/012074.wav|in character like i can't believe these resistance you know i don't know it was
data/025927.wav|the thriving esports scene they got a thriving
data/028799.wav|a good day if you took what i made in one month and
data/027919.wav|what do we need what's going to get our users back and get them back on instagram
data/016366.wav|you american jobs and small businesses instead according to law enforcement it funded a swim up bar and a horse stable the buyer that's worth
data/013066.wav|i love sour patch anyway it
data/022349.wav|professional gamer and global brand ambassador for dr squash
data/015972.wav|existence until this year amazon didn't make money for its first 20 years
data/028031.wav|better worker protections higher wages um
data/030629.wav|okay was a nato base thing it was a nato-based thing it was like
data/009976.wav|when it comes to comedy songs i
data/016535.wav|every game ever from the beginning of time
data/019981.wav|sometimes four and marvel at this point
data/004670.wav|in theaters but i did see it spiritually if that makes any sense you see the minions rise of
data/027156.wav|guaranteed or you can print a bunch more money to band-aid it and
data/012323.wav|i was probably space other space basic things but the
data/005268.wav|he tries to betray and then he
data/018696.wav|it all they could just own like if sony just
data/002180.wav|die percent of what i thought would be helpful going in wasn't it didn't
data/020461.wav|in the past and made money what is it
data/011675.wav|one thing so ari is obviously a bigger fan
data/009636.wav|if if mischief just initiates badly or
data/005995.wav|like the amount of hate they gave
data/003404.wav|what's going on in china was that beijing and the main
data/026290.wav|itself but that model has changed the world of marketing
data/001261.wav|i mean company account let me see
data/032066.wav|all day trying to get our scripts ahead
data/026262.wav|reasons for their outside market rewards and
data/004009.wav|worse but i'm going to play with him tomorrow
data/020665.wav|the esports you may know me from my twitch stream where i go deep in depth on esports by watching old
data/001871.wav|i don't even i'm not sure it's actually going to come to fruition
data/016762.wav|what which is like the united states it's basically a free cheat code to beat these demographic clips and and we're not using it and it's actually crazy and this applies to both trump and biden
data/030066.wav|play the first four hours every day i
data/032185.wav|what you get quadruple your money they give you three racks
data/002836.wav|worse to complete the deal so he is trying to drag this out he won the
data/025713.wav|it's like too targeted at your competitor i think
data/023768.wav|it's really really funny eminem super bowl commercial with
data/014382.wav|i think beyond this there's nothing that holds you there because the
data/012893.wav|well as equipment and like set up my dorm but whatever he was
data/032018.wav|i think i've seen a collection of more washed up players in my entire life aatrox only
data/030638.wav|when through it and i i was like
data/028468.wav|this kid does not look to the left he turns to the right he sees my dad my dad tries to be
data/019771.wav|which means they often will buy it so the
data/023746.wav|without cause it's an actual at let's find out
data/004595.wav|i said let's do it again so now
data/007419.wav|can i join in and then that's we have to do you
data/005317.wav|i used jarvis not face jarvis face drivers on
data/020324.wav|i'm sorry i don't know this guy he's one of their friends his
data/022048.wav|one by one woman who worked at denny's and wasn't being monitored that closely once people saw that was successful all hell broke loose but that began an era of brand social but as the years have gone on and we've all gotten a little more
data/008495.wav|actually i legitimately read the entire
data/031561.wav|that means he can mine again now the game is
data/016272.wav|in a losing graphic which is uh wow that's crazy how they
data/016629.wav|the number of days above 70 degrees in a
data/022680.wav|into the future tumblr was big with
data/003277.wav|are they caused in the last month so theoretically they can go for a third chance and that's awesome it's forgiveness okay yes two in a month but in their defense
data/018997.wav|just drop dead gorgeous she was uh clever and witty
data/028060.wav|in the world three trillion dollars plus and it began with
data/008710.wav|it's that seems more likely to what i'm saying and even if it's higher that that
data/000309.wav|it on and i tell everybody this like on friday i tell everybody i say hey this
data/016429.wav|well that are getting screwed by this and i would like them to know that the root cause of it comes back to this stuff and i know that a lot of things get blamed i know that blame
data/015628.wav|which means peacock is like i said dead i think they're dead in the water
data/031267.wav|can barely tell and right as this game happened this
data/012926.wav|in an investment you can with a cost of almost
data/001867.wav|yeah i mean i can't imagine that like
data/002756.wav|i guess pay the musician now contact pay the musician
data/016323.wav|we're all the little boys and girls in
data/017114.wav|if the black speaking a new things we take some new subs welcome to the if the play uh speaking of new things let me thank
data/022964.wav|i this okay this is more realistic
data/004444.wav|one day on a sunday so it's a monday in
data/011730.wav|you know whatever everyone is in character every single one i can retain
data/006046.wav|that's just their culture yeah he told me
data/021222.wav|are based on entirely how much the office you can watch this is pick your peacock and they
data/007172.wav|and j mook out of nowhere again i've
data/014088.wav|that is when all the the the combatants had shown up and the war began beginning with probably ninja and drake in mid 20 late
data/009250.wav|but i will you know what i'll do i want to bring back so like right when
data/027325.wav|about a previous marketing mondays scarcity
data/018597.wav|i decided yet here's the actual answer is i can't predict it because they haven't
data/018706.wav|exxon mobil that's right they could also
data/021466.wav|now they could still lose it tomorrow because what happened
data/002382.wav|tomorrow new map brand new map tomorrow
data/023175.wav|i was eating cereal so i'll join him and
data/010463.wav|yo big a just called up my boy
data/000452.wav|get it in my mind at five in the morning with a massive stack of ships in front
data/009289.wav|you mean loot boxes yeah i think the way to escape it is probably some sort of legislation to be honest i mean
data/030190.wav|can't get up and so we're both trying to
data/014585.wav|is so dominant that no matter what happens to live let's say for example
data/024706.wav|well points will be magnifique i don't know if you guys
data/016333.wav|of course always taking dubs i knew you
data/009802.wav|could fall by as much as 50
data/030775.wav|wrote on a cliff and it's hanging on by a thread and
data/016798.wav|well the top but we are eliminating the most extremes of poverty and that that is truth and
data/023970.wav|it's level so i'm gonna try and give you one layer deeper tuesday august
data/022700.wav|i had to hit that goal if you wonder why
data/015325.wav|so jeff bezos personally demanded he went to his executives and he personally demanded his own game of thrones jeff bezos said i want us to have our own game of thrones i don't care what it costs this is a true
data/005171.wav|anyway but it looked good i mean why just one nail
data/007367.wav|you can see it during the
data/002002.wav|the they're very low cash to run they're
data/030046.wav|try and distract me so this is kind of more of a psychological breaking test for me interesting sure yeah like that one
data/029284.wav|sad to see a truck forgot the game which
data/027015.wav|new chapter in investing e-trade now from
data/011189.wav|i thought you were like 23.
data/020077.wav|instagram is worth hundreds of billions of dollars it is the
data/022541.wav|ready but like to an extreme it wasn't
data/001240.wav|if you guys have ever seen the xbox tick tock i
data/011178.wav|like stream is one thing but if you're
data/003729.wav|actually they were doing incredibly well and things like batteries and stuff like that and so it's like yeah the ftc is not have a great track
data/006099.wav|and it'll give you the handshake so cody obviously intercepted
data/019519.wav|the better more iconic but notice the difference between i'm loving it in this i think the problem with this is that
data/009244.wav|what i have a marble stream vid
data/015891.wav|they're trying to win so they can make more money
data/025417.wav|wage tracing on graphics of the orc crying
data/002921.wav|i had no problem with the grey
data/008731.wav|interior significance is the word very
data/025930.wav|event from a business plb because cs
data/002561.wav|well the game goes i can't be the only one
data/012311.wav|everything i mean the food was really cool because oh i didn't show you
data/011585.wav|this is actually the biggest and this is
data/015044.wav|it's very simple chart every year in the early
data/021725.wav|you might spend a little extra money for some bonus fake comments and
data/031387.wav|if the from this guy drinking out of a bidet
data/024375.wav|i must have been the only person in the world
data/008498.wav|what's there's not that many i
data/030477.wav|was uncharacteristic but i was feeling like just i
data/030308.wav|oh yeah i was yeah i
data/025505.wav|well a lot of people are in the digital space right now who will talk up something with no
data/027072.wav|it's dancing i thought he would die you thought he would die
data/016717.wav|what the public that's very clever you should make a
data/027596.wav|it's gonna make things better i think more realistically he is trying to get exit on truth shut down truth make some money i
data/022808.wav|that's a business model that could never

data/027704.wav|will pay the fee for you it covers literally everything overall I'm really
data/024883.wav|the method a lot by making you think you've earned something and saying you could only
data/012880.wav|give it a real shot if you're going to do it give it a real shot because
data/009995.wav|they'll have to do jake novak

data/017898.wav|are you by yourself yes have you tried to get out
data/018998.wav|she was traveling a lot and i thought man this is like a perfect brand fit okay she loved gaming and then i realized she is not real this is riot's newest influencer
data/026218.wav|that these companies use how they're
data/001688.wav|i could probably talk about it but grandpa joe literally lives for himself and he
data/000580.wav|good or not the point is
data/012015.wav|like it's like the half day friday full day saturday after sunday after the half day
data/025162.wav|came from by the way this
data/002980.wav|is the smartest thing i've ever seen no one's going to watch
data/032250.wav|he has like an eight the point is whoever's
data/014052.wav|who moves faster than entire teams of development people that i've seen just so much faster
data/016626.wav|yes it's 19 of the hottest years on
data/032330.wav|i had the foremost expert i just did it there's not a vast difference in skill in fact i'm quite sure that p five for me at least was harder there is zero chance he completed whatever you're not finish naga forestry with his i i the foremost expert i just did it there's not a vast difference in skill in fact i'm quite sure
data/001678.wav|it's only 14 minutes it's got a lot of
data/009459.wav|the games they snowball out of control
data/016034.wav|the monday and i think they are oh
data/021308.wav|and i think if you look at these numbers
data/000771.wav|but you know maybe here's what i'm thinking we go to like a public place like
data/006717.wav|the veil yeah like like and then she responded what
data/014482.wav|it's like joys of my life that i trusted my gut on that one and i'm
data/002735.wav|got paid a dime and you have a hundred and ten dollars
data/027393.wav|oh we're suing them and that would have been an appropriate response even if it was just her name and likeness but actually the game was called kim kardashian sex tape
data/011658.wav|in november which turned out to be like the market peak like my amazon and my nvidia and my sony like a lot of my tech stuff i sold like
data/019706.wav|and then also they got him to do songs internally which means that's that's
data/020029.wav|i hope there's people that are not in a deep online war over what mobile ios you lose
data/026966.wav|when people over on the concept of the metaverse right now right now because again they're about
data/020819.wav|i was a lot of way congratulations
data/026446.wav|that has sold more subs than almost any
data/008067.wav|we had one meal of chipotle together i mean i like
data/005165.wav|i think she did a pretty good job especially not knowing anything about the
data/012945.wav|wizard did a bunch of layoffs including some friends that i know
data/000730.wav|the last laugh always gets the last laugh and
data/005121.wav|big a saudi arabia trip well maybe i'll go
data/002505.wav|at the end of the game they're both owned by the same conglomerate who's been like pitting them against each other to
data/021102.wav|in the pizza for five dollars only at
data/004510.wav|from me to you couldn't mean it more if i tried and
data/022525.wav|at google we seek to hire the most exceptional people
data/025597.wav|it's like someone's in his ear like hey
data/028058.wav|that literally turned around a dying company apple was a dying small company basically kept afloat by microsoft who was giving them money every year to use office so that they could say they had competition literally apple was being kept afloat so that microsoft could go to
data/028570.wav|well for me and as he was doing it he was asking me all these questions like so do you ever use this for business or
data/024058.wav|insane amount of money i'm sure like most businesses that are
data/019716.wav|the population that's eight that's 15
data/017426.wav|if the for people to not do drugs so it
data/022882.wav|the actual clip from right before tim sweeney took to make his opening
data/029419.wav|and i send it to him and then like three
data/005507.wav|i be worried of them saying something really bad or are we're not at this event it
data/008367.wav|and remix the same five ingredients into some new way to
data/015966.wav|and they're making smart consumer friendly moves and it's it's working for them and since they're kind of in the lead
data/011847.wav|it's like it's it's it's a small room now the
data/000203.wav|and not get bullied for some reason for some goddamn reason he didn't get bullied i have
data/025889.wav|more of a forward thinker and less of a
data/028455.wav|i was reading i was reading a book uh maybe
data/022089.wav|because it never seems to dry up we have
data/017329.wav|bonus effect is that amazon does pay
data/012096.wav|i was like yeah yeah i'm ready to go brother yeah
data/031179.wav|but now the the platform wars are
data/003696.wav|movements can happen things can change um it's not impossible people
data/014355.wav|does get their own live everyone's made their own
data/015643.wav|and they have star trek nerds and that's basically all they've gotten
data/011444.wav|your current skills it's a deal i'll see you on wednesday it's tomorrow i'll get on a flight now
data/029221.wav|i am ready to hustle okay give me a chance let's do this
data/011732.wav|employees is a gen z theater kid okay then there are the actual actors and i'll get to those guys in a minute but
data/003392.wav|end of the day you guys are taking the robot side
data/028514.wav|and i'm at work at twitch i'm probably
data/027496.wav|four billion dollars he's buying the company about
data/023224.wav|but i'm also not stupid i know that most of the things i eat when i don't pay attention are unhealthy
data/021232.wav|there's not that many brands on
data/001612.wav|if you have a video please go to the discord and drop it in the get smarter
data/027229.wav|i think a lot of aaa games
data/003866.wav|and of the day i think it's i think that's a
data/008516.wav|and i don't think i sold around 45 to 42
data/000167.wav|this next part i don't think any of you could guess for any reason there's legitimately no way
data/007786.wav|a video like what if i just put out another
data/001554.wav|the should everyone knows we get a bonus question
data/006604.wav|it's great i think eric did a really good job
data/023651.wav|just show you my favorite billboard ad of all
data/026543.wav|as copycats shameless copying is so dumb sure take inspiration
data/017301.wav|it's just like one or two random stories not
data/027598.wav|actually as things ramp up for the 2024
data/007104.wav|watching a lot more youtube ever since i started streaming and when you watch a lot of youtube for your main media diet you are very prone to getting pushed into an obsession funnel because it snowballs you know what i'm saying if your media diet is
data/012296.wav|when he wins one hand she punts everything to him i mean she goes all in with like a
data/001971.wav|of exciting because what you could
data/015103.wav|it's almost a dead company in 2011.
data/012315.wav|it wasn't like pizza and like mac and cheese there was like everything was like costs though but hear it wasn't like pizza and like mac and cheese it was like everything was like custo
data/002618.wav|i've never seen such a giga chat response on when
data/031019.wav|i read this article about landlords burning down buildings to get the rent and i was laughing i was like you're not going to burn this down
data/019551.wav|this has no business being this good i i i can't believe what what made this guy do this he doesn't even it's only one brand
data/025803.wav|it felt like where it's all slipping more towards riot and away from blizzard and i found this quora thread from
data/029894.wav|the twitter app right in front of me because
data/021979.wav|in gross and that's why jeff bezos does the
data/003142.wav|war snapchat is dead and the company lost
data/019359.wav|it's so bad the teacher remembers it i want to
data/018102.wav|the be a good idea as an advertisement it
data/016205.wav|didn't bezos just make a company to
data/027310.wav|in this is the one i'm talking about later
data/008523.wav|i wanted to get some kind of profit
data/032393.wav|that was almost at the end and i stopped phase one down
data/001221.wav|was that to have many many companies would love
data/000989.wav|it's your birthday dude everyone seems
data/010004.wav|the problem is jake novak is completely sort of
data/027915.wav|is absolutely a win for my man mark zuckerberg who is never late to the party okay because he announced
data/022579.wav|and they just called it dreamcraft
data/012972.wav|and like people that are even hella committed to it are just getting burnt out and pushed out of it because not
data/005888.wav|michael jordan or lebron and he's like yeah i'm the i'm that guy i'm michael jordan of fall guys like he thought he invented the jordan
data/026016.wav|nude he be your poo is free which just rolls off
data/031604.wav|and like chips that was the food i had no money so that's what i had for a weekend now
data/023842.wav|congrats hey peter saw your instagram
data/023866.wav|in that bowl bowl of strawberries
data/022329.wav|news articles about someone else's brand but because
data/006812.wav|wait season three is coming uh
data/020559.wav|and i think the smartest thing to do for my
data/021508.wav|i are a team of rich guys that um other rich
data/028802.wav|okay so i was like yeah i'm making
data/029927.wav|when he was a host like you would
data/008323.wav|at the on my hairline either i'll be honest with you at least we have a new channel five
data/010374.wav|wiki the video i think so
data/001782.wav|so much better than the video i just
data/003665.wav|it should be taken care of but that one guy makes more money than the other
data/013942.wav|a credit card and if you pay off a credit card every
data/029910.wav|so he's like obviously going to act out a bit like if they just had his side of the story on that a little bit
data/017706.wav|one of the highest nps scores which is a net promoter score a chance of someone recommending the brand after
data/024795.wav|at the quote do not tell them that people don't spend money that is cancer whatever you do if you spend money in a game other players
data/024637.wav|in poverty because let's get to my fail over the weekend a chinese real estate titan called
data/020177.wav|never forget hey you know what never
data/003307.wav|they said while some maintain that two consecutive quarters
data/027455.wav|his return this may it'd be worse if you said
data/019163.wav|things that would be a lie obviously
data/001968.wav|well joke but i think literally like if if um
data/022040.wav|the bk guys doubled down thought they
data/030391.wav|i the guy's like opening the back and i
data/019899.wav|there we go i figured it out
data/023584.wav|it's helped this to me is a fascinating
data/025412.wav|the rings the for the gamecube
data/019111.wav|the trends data I've been looking into
data/008823.wav|and if he just focuses on tesla
data/003118.wav|and then you go somewhere else and get a much more healthy work-life balance with better pay it's actually not
data/011965.wav|we need help like checking on some cargo in the cargo room or whatever you start
data/029372.wav|it's a little bit i clearly am passionate about the game maybe to a fault but clearly and then they start talking about
data/021448.wav|you have to pull out first or you're left with nothing one more thing i have to say because people are
data/017339.wav|that's the scary part that's what's coming but yeah i mean for now it's just an interesting fact i just thought
data/008351.wav|we have so many recessions because
data/025748.wav|not for the faint of heart all
data/015258.wav|what is allowing them to so far grow their way out of their debt now if this growth slows that's their only weakness i want to say that overall
data/023734.wav|the important to me but they're uh
data/005285.wav|i rarely i work all day and then stream at night that's that's what i do i don't even leave my house very often i
data/021971.wav|you've taken nine years off your life and he says he has a vivid memory of thinking he was going to be applauded for his cleverness and arithmetic skills he thought she would say jeff you're so smart you've made some tricky estimates and done some great division instead his grandmother
data/001822.wav|about it for a while because i used to read
data/000807.wav|and like when everybody's at the table i could toss a few hundred in and i just
data/013464.wav|you shouldn't be humble that's just rude
data/007358.wav|but when there's a hard opponent i'll switch to fox like he wouldn't stick with it and like j mook was like the one who's
data/004675.wav|you're pretty confident in that in that direction
data/012475.wav|in fully betrayed the crew we don't get punished at all in fact the actors are like
data/026384.wav|tesla cyber truck okay it's a product that doesn't need to pay for
data/008389.wav|at the tweet if you're not following on twitter
data/006752.wav|watching your stream maybe like a week ago
data/017788.wav|now i think for example at the end of my stream when everyone
data/007374.wav|it was just an awesome tournament i mean it was it was it was sick and you know what when mango didn't make top eight i was nervous
data/000308.wav|they take it back and more every
data/028365.wav|it's the true north here and it's basically what a compass does
data/018863.wav|team but also very good well I mean yes right
data/014563.wav|in fact that i can pause take a call is huge yeah exactly it's massive and i twitch like added a new rewind
data/019960.wav|and i remember in the book he says he was looking out at a disney parade and he noticed there wasn't a single character in the float that had been made in the past like
data/001397.wav|that is huge there's a lot of
data/022928.wav|was losing loves cross-platform that's it none of
data/026321.wav|although they chose to display it
data/001189.wav|about the stream when they wanted to support they
data/020489.wav|they also made gwent based on a card
data/007701.wav|i'm not going to the topic yet
data/004932.wav|and like look at this like so on june
data/013307.wav|you are completely misunderstanding this relationship this is not a business where you guys are
data/027025.wav|if the more american than that chills literal chills
data/007482.wav|is so i don't know if you guys know
data/031469.wav|so that was the finale and i gotta tell you man it was just
data/024726.wav|okay no today was not the brunt of it
data/015483.wav|if the separately you just you just get it all for
data/012911.wav|good marketer and i felt like blizzard would be like a
data/029753.wav|you know let everyone get in on it with
data/024174.wav|departure on that day everyone was saying day off
data/014757.wav|what the commenting on the video viewers this
data/001025.wav|you're doing a thing but i will show this one because this
data/015671.wav|better at making content for whatever reason they can make
data/011439.wav|and then i popped it out and so it was it was kind of an epic moment like it was kind of really cool
data/010987.wav|yo yo honestly check this out
data/021313.wav|on an average night that means
data/023623.wav|so to add a little positivity this episode i decided to write them a
data/017402.wav|do you actually add an image and to get
data/030770.wav|he's a rambling about this jeff bezos thing let's let him know he
data/027799.wav|were expensive or they raise interest rates and
data/008232.wav|i think it's the i mean normally sure being the
data/012600.wav|sell my house and buy disney yeah
data/010457.wav|at last minute so i'm trying to be ahead of the game
data/028265.wav|that's what you get she she was like please please do not hire this person please i will give you even more references but this person is absolutely miserable if you hire
data/012760.wav|it's pick eight this is not gonna
data/019036.wav|that let me that confirmed to me that this is
data/012417.wav|i wish i had the video
data/007942.wav|i think of the resub sulky spulk thank you
data/007197.wav|then i found out so come genesis
data/017089.wav|it's it's not a recent photo it's like literally from
data/016335.wav|plus holden ones in golf so he claims
data/026997.wav|things went wrong number one their website went down
data/021993.wav|in brand history okay so i originally was
data/029717.wav|in that moment i was i was on team
data/017710.wav|okay so them investing in the purchase and post-purchase areas of the clock have generated outsized rewards
data/022090.wav|we will never forget cvs pharmacy you know try to keep it as basic as possible but they thought we gotta add the cvs logo here hold don't
data/000477.wav|actually i don't know what they said i
data/029322.wav|what i was wearing and i thought this was
data/018513.wav|or business in gaming to win this console war and use that to win the cloud gaming more they have to do that they want to be
data/018358.wav|for a year how do i go
data/026246.wav|that's amazing you know because people are psychologically susceptible they are more likely to buy things that they cannot afford so um okay anyway that's it
data/030372.wav|it knows the apartment better than me so i constantly was shuffling it around to different spots that i would even forget where
data/030876.wav|it could i couldn't relate could not be me
data/005748.wav|and like it's almost like there's a meter i think i think it was either a sauna
data/019035.wav|is there was two reactions to this that
data/022724.wav|i made famously the windows phone what a gorgeous piece
data/012344.wav|oh yeah here it is here here's my
data/010011.wav|the video it already has a pre-written
data/002212.wav|we're headed for the worst the worst economic
data/014969.wav|at the topic so the streaming
data/013255.wav|as it get like push even mango even as it good i like push
data/010887.wav|go and say stupid stuff but they they they have real like hustle culture type stuff and i
data/011862.wav|have a something different happening like there's always there's like a there's a meteor shower or another ship
data/011488.wav|hey stevie blunder i love you know i love when people spam a huge
data/028009.wav|with our games on pc to make a profit this competition is awesome the second one of
data/029992.wav|without having to do any work or spend any money and then i get to watch the
data/009075.wav|and bookstore and i would get games like pokemon so
data/007657.wav|you are relentless bro you're relentless it was one time
data/004406.wav|i did say pp you got me on that one so today we're gonna be doing a bunch of
data/011580.wav|we just throw it up right what's
data/000516.wav|for the just like the bachelor
data/018506.wav|these consumer products people aren't buying walkmans though let
data/021985.wav|a little bummed okay i have never seen my dad that tired he is exhausted and i know how
data/022375.wav|red bull in this video we're at
data/020981.wav|what the chat said conor's going to starve
data/030193.wav|like literally it was like there was no way to make progress
data/025658.wav|but obviously the real one is not so the market cap is
data/000810.wav|i haven't paid ludwig so it's as thin as it was
data/008071.wav|it's the last day of february and i just wanted to know what you've done to support the cause of
data/001065.wav|a little bit do cause i was insulted it's
data/019646.wav|okay well listen to that way i'm loving it
data/022320.wav|well media channels all working to make the message clear the new way to
data/007206.wav|one stage and i'm totally down i'll pay for your flight or flight for
data/024757.wav|and actually fun to play beautiful game and so it has removed all
data/006371.wav|is he apparently to make a guild in the game it costs you
data/024439.wav|was your eye i think you're
data/021118.wav|hey guys look look look look look look look
data/020056.wav|within a few years from this yahoo would be defunct completely and then google would have youtube which is like so insanely profitable worth about
data/020588.wav|watch this is a this is a really bad launch and and you really really really rarely get a brand as sterling as what
data/029472.wav|just a terrible way to spend your time then the next day that boss
data/015467.wav|gotta like a daughter in america would need it if they were
data/028394.wav|write that down actually when i worked at twitch one of the big buzzwords was move the needle well that's not
data/002352.wav|yeah okay that's not exactly that's not exactly how i describe our relationship i don't and i don't think that me giving you content for free
data/022201.wav|i made this ad the dog would have hung itself probably true because they really really really don't know when to stop and the car would have crashed and then like when the family came over to inspect the remains
data/021424.wav|or money on the people's trades
data/026204.wav|i want to poor shame stands but his tv is
data/003556.wav|super working out and i was far from friends and so like like maybe people are
data/009941.wav|know it sounds crazy people don't think the long game there's plenty of people that have it's like
data/024420.wav|for decades now billboards are pretty much like a
data/016796.wav|as majority of wealth being sucked up by a
data/010361.wav|reacting to tick tocks so we've got a full
data/012854.wav|was in college but i was doing really badly and
data/024483.wav|i thought it was it was resoundingly you know one of the worst ads i saw this
data/020157.wav|making them more cynical to growth or authenticity they have full access to social media
data/014496.wav|will do whatever the shroud fired you
data/001360.wav|of the mood when they have to
data/017503.wav|it's just get this is good this is good games
data/028437.wav|one day instead of being able to go home after school my dad
data/018518.wav|i buying um exclusive production deals with
data/003437.wav|i mean it's party representatives i believe it
data/028947.wav|at certain points it was really dark because i just felt like very deeply deeply homesick like for like i wanted to eat peanut butter and cheese this is where i lived
data/030380.wav|put it on my dick because how did you guess that that was literally that's crazy that's yes that's exactly what i did and it worked like a
data/005836.wav|i had to have the only awkward conversation that i had to have
data/016146.wav|just being shirtless in like 20 minutes
data/012971.wav|teacher shortage brewing like it's already been a problem and it's getting worse
data/014765.wav|that because you guys need prayer you guys need jesus badly and he
data/031898.wav|at the jetty over the garage jenny
data/029908.wav|so like when he was a kid i feel like he was projecting those super high standards on everybody else and well yeah if somebody had just explained that
data/028049.wav|then to do anything illegal even and
data/003928.wav|in the wild off the wall take and it

data/010586.wav|is it effective are you still doing it it's crazy because only one person
data/001765.wav|i guess the point is that people often make fun of grandpa joe for being lazy but when you think about it you know the rich billionaire is probably more appropriate to make fun of especially if we're thinking about real life which is fine the movies themselves do not make fun of grandpa joe at all like the movies themselves make grandpa go out to
data/022478.wav|well all i want to do all we want to do is

data/008307.wav|and then we're gonna go about 90 maybe
data/024162.wav|ninja very smartly did exactly two streams in the off season after
data/030082.wav|what am i gonna do when i
data/027563.wav|the only reason to do that was
data/027374.wav|in the company same week and that of course is probably all my gen alpha viewers favorite company of all time
data/011903.wav|with the head tails and she had like a and i
data/023368.wav|if the random logic puzzle and then i kept scrolling and then this guy said blue
data/026792.wav|facebook anymore facebook's completely gone for them the youth doesn't
data/013845.wav|it it's theirs the bethesda deal is very
data/017112.wav|i know you had an idea but what about my
data/015690.wav|wanna call it i'm pretty sure this is what the
data/025379.wav|like every three days for the past year that's why they they probably fired the guy from
data/025538.wav|everyone's waiting for the other shoe to
data/023843.wav|the upcoming member of your family if i had your talent i'd write you a song about it but i'll
data/023526.wav|ferrari on the other hand they raise their perceived value super high and then they raise their price right up on the
data/023484.wav|ads and that is why they are the official truck of the nfl they spend about
data/003602.wav|the bay's so goddamn expensive i'm
data/000614.wav|but then then we have to enact operation
data/011467.wav|alright well macklemore has also got albums
data/021491.wav|and and pay you back later
data/001956.wav|if we cannot do it live everything is kind of have to do it live everything is
data/021750.wav|twelve hours a day and i would eat one meal a day a single jimmy john sandwich
data/016498.wav|with any one person your personal performance only matters as part of the equation and a lot more of
data/006492.wav|card usage and they're also ramping up another form of debt debt rebranded that i've been talking about which is called buy now pay later now i've done a lot of marketing
data/019358.wav|jason i don't want to just be
data/005387.wav|nails done then obviously it would be worth it if i could yeah that's that's a
data/000482.wav|and i sit there and i start to shake
data/021170.wav|disclosure this is important for both legal personal and moral reasons one is that predicting is an art not a science and the act
data/021092.wav|the bounty of earth this is the cube of rubik this simple puzzle was
data/011058.wav|plus even back then they all died of
data/026644.wav|in the competitive landscape okay because it
data/013496.wav|you know i like the one i think we did it last time but it was like me after eight minutes of work i think i deserve a little treat
data/027560.wav|with the company and there was a million shares or whatever they would print two million more that's the thing that's
data/027471.wav|i encourage you to contact your local representatives and ask them that
data/001563.wav|i pay the musician on discord for your fifty dollars thank you for playing
data/018217.wav|if only using the cheapest actor from it so they were able to get the dad in their budget obviously they could not get
data/002576.wav|five of your six dollars for a sub
data/012370.wav|if the code for me or something the code
data/026718.wav|we had all the mobile games number three of course game pass their major strategy and we've mentioned
data/011941.wav|fucking little data pad starts getting messages from some of the actors that i've already met because they
data/025326.wav|wade world of warcraft during 2007-2010
data/028523.wav|it's like hey boss i gotta go home i i
data/017976.wav|week that the supreme court is
data/015594.wav|of this competition okay they just they don't need to beat walmart and target they just need to grab some cheap stuff
data/009571.wav|i didn't like doing pretty well and i was like how did you do that
data/021643.wav|oh my god it would have broken the
data/014447.wav|i think they're both converging on the same point they're basically being forced to
data/024324.wav|wait if you're in michigan my understanding is that eminem does like
data/001673.wav|it literally worked it's actually genius
data/027132.wav|the sets interest rates it's hard to figure out what that means or what's going on interest rates are based so imagine this is the federal reserve it's just a big
data/014991.wav|with every demographic even except for old people
data/031940.wav|a little bit angry at what's going on and they make a stick and they start
data/016423.wav|yo trickles down everything's too expensive to afford
data/010252.wav|is i get to soak up that content you know so it's like the existence of the read it that i created has inadvertently lead if people getting to see evan gao get his dick peppered which when is i get to soak up that content you know so it's like the existence of the reddit that i created has inadvertently led to people getting
data/026432.wav|read it and he's made a conscious choice again most streamers choose not to do
data/029909.wav|teen years old and lonely and all his friend group is melee and they're they're they pretty much hate
data/028981.wav|for three days i went back to the military base the truck was so hard and i got my debit card and i about
data/013137.wav|and i was telling them how
data/009185.wav|if the five gifted how did the paper mario
data/003850.wav|well he's marketed himself to both people
data/023976.wav|we are the past five days it averaged a max of seven thousand downloads so it's global total downloads that means global across the entire world for being out for months of only fans
data/007663.wav|it's just like if i get gaming time like all
data/007412.wav|as it's only a few months from where i lived and
data/008252.wav|one when they had a tiny
data/001777.wav|i know that they're the same height
data/030639.wav|at the one fact i remember was that the largest river in russia was lake baikal i remember that clearly because there was a big map of russia a big zoom in
data/018054.wav|in time sorry i have to pause
data/032255.wav|it's really low it's like a two
data/014122.wav|if so high because those type of numbers don't work like at all so that's where we
data/026186.wav|this fail is on arcane last week i talked about
data/016305.wav|but for now let's give him a huge hand for putting up some lebron numbers with this new stat
data/022141.wav|this and we sent eight million people just
data/012722.wav|what happened but for some reason i i was deep into it and i
data/006970.wav|if you want to link me i'll look at it
data/013429.wav|okay you should rethink your entire life but
data/031103.wav|it makes right now i'm pretty sure very soon not only will he make more than us he'll
data/004657.wav|i yeah i'm excited for a little bit of a weekend
data/018218.wav|will ferrell so they got this guy and then they used kids of it's a
data/016675.wav|these are springing up left and right pillow
data/012038.wav|like you all have power with the force and i'm like bro we've been training for
data/000941.wav|and if you could choose any one thing on earth it would be to change my middle name
data/018860.wav|one for the day probably netted five hundred G's for
data/017983.wav|no no no i'm not it's like the applebee's commercial during the who that
data/032306.wav|where you beat them without getting hit once how beautiful is that how beautiful is that okay now my personal opinion is that it's not
data/024540.wav|if you make an app on apple store you're not allowed to even tell your customers
data/000552.wav|what about it and wasn't the he wasn't even
data/028899.wav|the diego told me was that about let's say
data/021593.wav|with diamond hands never let it go
data/014188.wav|wake who i think can bring over a lot of people and get a lot of new inspiring streamers to try let me explain why that's important so we're going to get out of this and we're going to get into
data/025584.wav|it's dramatically over gesturing and one is
data/013392.wav|in my life i've never done it and i've always wanted to and maybe i'll do it now but
data/027240.wav|maybe a thing worth considering is why many players are so forgiving of rough edges
data/009900.wav|but it's also like i don't trust that if i gave you a house you wouldn't become a
data/023372.wav|is discord ever i tagged him and said this is wrong
data/012632.wav|it was cool or like she floats up and
data/020234.wav|with their account that's really funny i mean normally they'd be like okay what happened here obviously this is trolling we're going to go with perry like i
data/007741.wav|with friends and let's just say my passive income covered the bill easy clap so you mean like you made everyone else pay and you just sort of sat there
data/022679.wav|for the ss yahoo here to be pulled by
data/024873.wav|you were talking about when they gave someone a free gift like people were exiting
data/017272.wav|that being said it's actually not all available i'm sorry to call that a dub
data/012465.wav|like i've been on the same ship as you this whole two days i
data/010364.wav|six seven hours 12 hours of balloons it's
data/012216.wav|it's like you roll a number and you have to get as close to that number as possible with
data/011892.wav|like they were more into it than i was
data/004212.wav|it's the europe and china plenty of crazy updates
data/014930.wav|a little bit of juice in between i would like you guys to tag yourself as we jump into marketing
data/027431.wav|one of them got promoted to me that i
data/000954.wav|even better you know because you get
data/021898.wav|two examples that i use in my real life
data/019174.wav|console war ads of all time and we're
data/017973.wav|i have seen the supreme court news it's
data/014738.wav|anyway i guess thanks for the impersonation miz really
data/023764.wav|different animal and the same beast
data/020603.wav|the supreme collab and there she is signing an autograph for a tier
data/017978.wav|if you have the right to an
data/027816.wav|i know they're asking this because i can look at the data people are asking
data/032315.wav|truly a god gamer so anyway
data/023673.wav|hit him with the real and
data/022764.wav|and it would have been a better use of money
data/002749.wav|over a game that i could never win and you could only
data/030850.wav|okay people saw me like right
data/025097.wav|hardcore fans have a very low perception of the fox brand and again this all comes from something there's large
data/014916.wav|this is a really important win this is
data/023450.wav|is called margin okay that's how much you make what's important about the three lines theory is that the lines can never cross price can never go above this if
data/025962.wav|as like year and a half these are all
data/018511.wav|this is microsoft continuing to say we will not lose this
data/021567.wav|and what what's different about canadian brokers anyone else
data/003406.wav|if the that you on is that uh it's becoming
data/023950.wav|what our current reality they're just
data/008295.wav|i could do it while studying math it bangs something like that i gotta be honest
data/017828.wav|but focusing on that creating a better
data/002263.wav|i can't believe i can't believe you did that
data/030445.wav|i get down on one knee like literally just mid conversation
data/017383.wav|in january and the sequel by march and if we put enough money into this we can make it happen how much was disney total that's a great question it's probably as much as
data/008999.wav|what's going on with twitter i
data/009595.wav|they already are dude dota is a muddy depressing game nobody who know life's dota feels good about
data/010718.wav|adding that it's it's still better
data/027490.wav|if the conservatives believe it will herald a return of conservative voices like donald trump to the platform and democrats don't like that and some also don't like it for monopoly reasons which is that he is an extremely well he's the
data/018493.wav|twitch was a pretty big acquisition that was acquired by amazon for one billion dollars a little under actually one billion dollars mojang was acquired this is minecraft which was the biggest game in the world at the time it was acquired and also and also attracts
data/013814.wav|and then they thought about it for more than a minute and realized we gotta we gotta make
data/007906.wav|i want to see what your key messages though which was that you said check this out flip your monitor upside down four five three three three three three
data/018448.wav|these guys i mean this would be crazy but what if
data/008079.wav|saying a lot about it i don't remember me saying i was
data/009101.wav|well that's that's true but that's only because i think you really get more of the the nuance of a video if you're not distracted by the the
data/005656.wav|i i didn't know that the the entire dinner she was just like polite and quiet and nice and didn't really say anything weird and
data/030539.wav|demon was already on the way out
data/004903.wav|and he said yes he agreed to that deal and then right before that deal
data/020190.wav|worldwide and it was a very powerful tool eminem's
data/006207.wav|the flag okay and that and
data/011251.wav|i think it's a good idea
data/021814.wav|in all that so if you're watching this on youtube it is my personal mission
data/003134.wav|the find the thing wait this could be the
data/006140.wav|i at the fall guys tourney
data/020330.wav|it's a very convincing ad of the benefits i would
data/001559.wav|if you can get two more
data/006150.wav|not that i need to not that i need you guys to know but i
data/009010.wav|yeah would do actually is play fall guys with chat uh oh
data/016587.wav|exponentially increasing and they want to save that money so here's an example this is a browser called island it's basically just chrome and yet it's worth
data/014843.wav|into the day i think fans are making it very clear they don't want
data/020306.wav|it's targeting parents now they had to pay to put this in the
data/026951.wav|it was the highest rated ad of the super bowl
data/017457.wav|visual representation of a person sort
data/014989.wav|they are a loser but there's one guaranteed loser and that is
data/031783.wav|and what's changed but i think i'll summarize it by talking about the three horsemen of the apocalypse amaranth
data/030276.wav|in direct marketing on this bottle it was so easy to get confused you know having one friend make fun of you is one thing you
data/016968.wav|or i could play elden ring
data/010405.wav|and then they just print money it's not the free market
data/004367.wav|even the best photo i've seen in the last 24
data/009243.wav|can you do another marble stream it's still my favorite vid of
data/027543.wav|way more you should generally take it right but the board was was as you guys have probably seen the board of twitter has been fighting
data/006406.wav|pretty much the whole thing seems fraudulent hopefully they get in some kind of trouble for this but
data/015918.wav|in most countries netflix has been raising prices already you can only raise prices like that and still grow if you have a very high perceived value people have to really think you're you're delivering a lot of
data/019510.wav|it's definitely our highest rated one thus
data/030566.wav|i to stand in for the kiss shot oh this
data/025390.wav|you can get a team liquid hoodie for
data/020619.wav|im here to present the very first marketing monday award yes indeed because i love
data/012287.wav|he's like the smuggler guy and he's like super into it he's like talking to us
data/005090.wav|in awful business whether or not
data/029026.wav|so i was in a parking lot of a movie theater and my friend and i my friend by the
data/021958.wav|of a moat they call it so that's the idea is you do hard things that less people can do and you start to build this moat that
data/010541.wav|it out for sure for sure we'll figure it out
data/032100.wav|really furiously eating my snacks but as
data/013252.wav|if anyone okay nobody on twitch makes it
data/001497.wav|population you're going to argue with me
data/020843.wav|that i've heard in a long time powerful advice that i think inspired me when i read it
data/022684.wav|what she didn't understand was the sheer amount of porn on the website as well
data/015718.wav|i can talk about something i
data/028697.wav|i basically lived out of my car i go to every esports event in california i
data/008029.wav|it really at all it's just a
data/020107.wav|and get him back and around here he becomes ceo so right
data/023492.wav|and it worked it did whoever came up with truck
data/003994.wav|thanks for watching tomorrow i'll see you in six hours seven hours probably
data/026661.wav|what's an animal that like is
data/000373.wav|when they when they're like yeah high fiving
data/012633.wav|the choreography was pretty cool anyway people were
data/029399.wav|in a bit of a pickle and i'm sweating through my riot jacket so what i do is i go to the bathroom i say i
data/031864.wav|the new players are going to valorent
data/027911.wav|they hold but at least we can think about one thing we can say one thing and be happy
data/008273.wav|it's like the first wave of games i'm
data/019974.wav|isn't he wouldn't turn around at all disney was
data/012473.wav|with the fireworks outside the fireworks in space
data/007548.wav|was that meal bottom five things about world war
data/011282.wav|i quiet when i when i yes
data/003751.wav|service even though they really do want

data/014775.wav|lily bank is a bank designed for freelancers
data/032176.wav|of chip i repeat this process of chipping
data/018509.wav|there you go sony could not afford the
data/013369.wav|order them and get some sort of themes we have none of that i'm going
data/018345.wav|i've worked at a startup twitch i
data/013035.wav|you know what yeah let's run it
data/023378.wav|so just be careful if you're going to drop
data/021962.wav|nick was in here earlier wanted to get
data/028068.wav|on each one of those it
data/027262.wav|the talk about why i don't think couple ui
data/030031.wav|if you don't have it anymore
data/015545.wav|they love the iphone they love the the airpods
data/029225.wav|an important one for me it
data/009834.wav|ford stock is as low as it is when the ford
data/005690.wav|i have no i thought carl jacobs was like
data/030948.wav|what i'm doing it goes like this all right
data/021968.wav|at nine years old jeff bezos young jeff bezos saw a commercial on tv talking about how smoking is bad for you and how each puff of a cigarette takes two minutes off your life now jeff bezos as you might expect was a little nerd he liked math okay he liked doing calculations and his grandma smoked so he's in the car with his grandmother and he's like oh i've got a plan
data/006191.wav|lady is if you can't afford my rate
data/017222.wav|was completely off book off script he was fired people asked i
data/030496.wav|i start talking about memories that we've had together like just you know kind of reminiscing on our old stories okay this
data/015591.wav|the cost but they did buy it and roku has been going around with a little bit
data/030299.wav|give you any of you degenerates not one of you i could put in a room
data/009821.wav|it's an electric yeah electric sales
data/003832.wav|yeah i mean yeah i listen
data/022132.wav|after the explosion that they sent to every adidas person that went is insane i just
data/006432.wav|we use the guild treasury and buy everyone a
data/031258.wav|from the street and there's a there's a door on the side of
data/022758.wav|the internet now think remember twitch is essentially
data/019445.wav|so let's see how effective it was but the promo worked like magic saving the wheaties brand from
data/017900.wav|please hurry i'm hurting real bad you're
data/025437.wav|he salutes his own character so the
data/008244.wav|the writing for team liquid and going to different esports events and making
data/018745.wav|the the thousand dollars on a phone
data/001528.wav|exactly yes i start out easy because i
data/001207.wav|like if you are 14 years old don't get
data/016436.wav|and and the real world impacts of it are quite apparent so
data/027415.wav|they have multiple versions all of which are advertised as quote unquote free but often
data/029470.wav|and then i was so close on that
data/020655.wav|if it can't go to cutie i am so honored it went to this person what a genius way to use a
data/020319.wav|the new graphics just wasn't true
data/021610.wav|stellar rise above the rest revealing the
data/004612.wav|so that'll be in about two hours okay
data/026794.wav|that's like the two targets that
data/012396.wav|the front of everybody in the whole ship because he's got
data/017804.wav|to any almost business you interact with if you were to start a business you should think about how your customer interacts with you at all stages of the process um in
data/000361.wav|possible or the team's being misaligned
data/026690.wav|would have been terrible for the company there's no way he actually does it but again twitch caved
data/007500.wav|where he's like the nicest like oh no trouble kind of guy he's like oh she's like oh i'll take it back she's like i'll take it back i'll get you a burger
data/029081.wav|anyway yeah so oh so when someone asked
data/020721.wav|yes that is a very base tweet it really is but did it move sales
data/030729.wav|we have a fiance nice try idiots actually good question actually good question i don't have a
data/017981.wav|oh i did not mean to start the epic
data/026443.wav|it's after you become part of the mango
data/010907.wav|minions based takeover will happen i believe it's on a
data/018056.wav|if the situation please stay far away let the firemen do their job they do not need pepsi dude can't you give them something to help revive them pepsi
data/024833.wav|up one thing they never ever want is for you to be like okay i finally got it there's no amount of money that can get you perfection in this game and there's
data/009993.wav|watch this one what what am i watching
data/022717.wav|and essentially ran it into the nowhere it didn't go down
data/016754.wav|you old people which we barely have right now because millennials are a massive generation
data/001438.wav|not the worst answer possible what he it basically is right like i mean
data/002640.wav|at the end of the day someone has to win
data/002353.wav|the what i'm saying i don't feel like you're
data/015910.wav|but what they're finding out is that as they
data/001530.wav|we're all the american that knows absolutely nothing

data/003708.wav|we'll just steal it make their own version
data/015239.wav|it's but let me explain it it's about churn churn is the idea of if you sign up for a service watch something and then
data/017527.wav|way of viewing marketing and basically the point of today's mini marketing monday
data/004326.wav|the show i will give you
data/000327.wav|i think lud stands and two of my high school friends i think that is the squad
data/027389.wav|at the start cracking down on some things specifically with this big piece of news
data/005292.wav|in the building and i'm like with a group and
data/019806.wav|like like a guy you'd make it in
data/004370.wav|i generated image of stars with like darth vader on trial or something
data/010094.wav|they're awesome they're very very delicious i really really enjoy them and i always request them in the box
data/001785.wav|it was 17. logan or david
data/028874.wav|and you could prove it was your birthday they would give you a handle of one of these cheap liquors and i picked jack daniels and i got a handle
data/021005.wav|i'm already ready real album wait really
data/016958.wav|code it's a very cool app i recommend it they've been very supportive marketing monday and i do appreciate it
data/014116.wav|for the next two three years of our lives just because we are so freaking lucky ninja was a hero if you were already a
data/021185.wav|or even broker okay this is a bad trend people
data/000581.wav|so he sold out so we asked germa who lives in vegas bro what is actually the best show like what what's the show that's worth going to
data/002331.wav|but i'm glad you're i'm glad
data/011773.wav|which if you know anything about star
data/009564.wav|actually makes money actually for emirates doing great
data/025307.wav|well let's keep this game going let's make sure
data/015290.wav|it's a massive massive market size they've tossed a lot of money at the problem
data/027182.wav|in all over the internet and i thought i'd offer a unique perspective on it the question today is why elden ring cannot add
data/014542.wav|not today but for his first
data/003515.wav|it's not the first time this has happened in history like
data/023627.wav|please explain why you gave this score i need
data/018371.wav|good job or a bad job that generally leads to you feeling like miserable in a job okay that's what's one sign of a job that will become miserable if there's a number you can go to your boss and say hey i did this and i did it better than
data/029922.wav|they talked about how no one had beaten the five gods but they made it seem like leffen was
data/002860.wav|to my video so let me let you know it's leaning towards you know people are estimating what could happen is that
data/012705.wav|like league of legends is a game that makes you angry
data/015619.wav|in their first year of operation with all
data/009202.wav|not saying you're lying i'm just saying it's shocking it's like
data/008481.wav|is everyone said come to brazil and then i
data/027123.wav|which of money basically doing massive bailouts flooding the
data/022100.wav|of everyone roasting this guy appleby said let's get involved and make them hate us
data/001911.wav|in my editor one dollar a year as part of the nominal agreement that we put together that kind of cuts into my profit see the problem is i have to give away that one
data/017024.wav|go back to school today which is the
data/028065.wav|a cd player i really don't know what
data/009320.wav|i was around and i and and ari had
data/020738.wav|said these uncertain times instead of
data/007594.wav|service for genesis which is fine
data/004966.wav|was from her last name and said i don't want
data/009694.wav|more quincy w today no not playing any balloons but i will say that i ordered
data/020451.wav|with the score this is a 9 out of 10 on
data/009584.wav|well he didn't used to do that towards
data/010075.wav|after i think it's pretty great people that have
data/026610.wav|if something doesn't do it they probably don't work with you again but they don't want the the hassle of like not paying because then they might
data/028730.wav|we're getting closer and closer and closer
data/009337.wav|is that i get to have two bars
data/032032.wav|mike ross and ludwig made a career
data/010116.wav|a little bit it should sound good like it sounds like you should hear my voice
data/026354.wav|what allowed apple to get a massive head start in the
data/022046.wav|for talking about brand fails around i would say
data/032352.wav|the challenge the modding community in
data/006176.wav|are sold that he literally made
data/000166.wav|mike tyson shows up i'm not kidding i'm literally not
data/029854.wav|im watching this video bobby you were like this is church we
data/029646.wav|where did this come from we're all in
data/017380.wav|and took in more than i think like the next two combined
data/028213.wav|we talked for real time and he is the most charming flattering person to me he's asking
data/029800.wav|i was like oh just joking about scars falcon
data/021960.wav|in real life is you find a goal what's
data/022659.wav|and 20 seconds to game peacefully
data/011765.wav|right off the bat in character this
data/007279.wav|okay i'm here to help him out wherever
data/000663.wav|and then we would see him jog back
data/025039.wav|is julius it's not good quacks twitter
data/002588.wav|every marketer hey keep it up king and godspeed let's roll it classic kyle classic oh kyle i think the
data/028927.wav|she was fine with it okay i was just drunk and she was being
data/029279.wav|there was something special about tpp for sure
data/024954.wav|i just finished babylonia me who watched the video two years ago that's insane i would never do that me today a fake grand order whale
data/005296.wav|it was cool i had an experience that i've never had before and probably will never have again where
data/014873.wav|the console wars a lot on this stream i do a
data/027811.wav|if they were just saying it and it didn't really work and then they
data/021988.wav|is optimized all of his uh
data/011037.wav|tell me about it tell me about it
data/010992.wav|kind of like the eminem to your minions
data/014017.wav|i thought the bundles were about to
data/008061.wav|how did it feel getting in the headlines oh we'll talk about it we'll talk about it
data/024744.wav|i right around the millennium they start to add mobile you might notice mobile has gone from a little bit of gaming revenue
data/023107.wav|to imply that i a youtube raw could ever be influenced by marketing is pure insanity and to imply that i a youtube frog could ever be influenced by
data/021627.wav|this here sucks i'm sorry here's a m
data/029778.wav|i mean even if you never saw this
data/025172.wav|saw this tick tock i graduated college with a degree in design
data/008531.wav|is more likely now that i've really done my research i looked at legal precedent so
data/009739.wav|while be able to support his extra large fingers also feels like a bit of a
data/019303.wav|and years and i asked him if he still had for like i said
data/007949.wav|and sir not all of them were at my expense
data/002501.wav|in one of them's called something star space
data/009234.wav|whipped around and smashed as hard as it could
data/004225.wav|i guess and i'm glad they did it but
data/022181.wav|the powerball ticket is that the lesson go dig up grandma's
data/027098.wav|the knowledge in this guy i know he's he's
data/027767.wav|in a diverse mix of his
data/026176.wav|anyway that's one option the other
data/002644.wav|it's guaranteed money this is guaranteed money this
data/029531.wav|the world biggest names in melee and he gets invited to cast the
data/000759.wav|oh yeah okay wait i had a video idea
data/027013.wav|we are taking financial advice from memes
data/032109.wav|bloor was high he was laying on the
data/002003.wav|if they're just not like they're not a massive investment and you can make a ton of money
data/019836.wav|they said 16 times the detail they
data/022867.wav|at the top five worst acquisitions of all time thank you for watching targeting tuesday in the
data/023856.wav|i and they said they changed the classic piece of american
data/016015.wav|in the first two weeks so you have to yeah that's
data/000323.wav|it's like you can actually move around it's
data/023931.wav|it's funny like he's smiling this is a huge huge l for other
data/014219.wav|when people leave twitch it doesn't hurt twitch because while twitch's viewership numbers
data/004642.wav|in feel good i didn't sleep there last
data/019615.wav|as marketing monday on the jingles
data/016607.wav|we get around this alleviate this uh
data/026930.wav|we don't forget that you saw it moving on next up we got
data/025832.wav|or arcane success there's just no way this is the world of warcraft movie you'll notice not quite as beloved and this came out first like blizzard had the idea
data/004933.wav|yet confirmed that he's canceling the stock
data/016827.wav|talked about it but basically they didn't allow you to use your phone while you used it which is not good for our attention spans
data/003219.wav|oh that there's no money in it
data/016452.wav|you know while inflation has been
data/000478.wav|i don't know exactly what time they said but it was a long time okay so i say yes get me
data/009219.wav|want to play rts casually and it might do pretty
data/028836.wav|at night that's it that's what i did i went to the target near the near the
data/002266.wav|we type the ascii art of pop
data/011601.wav|he was amazing and better close all
data/005523.wav|are you drunk now no i'm not drunk now
data/020371.wav|where i don't think chad is
data/019574.wav|like the good one we did the vocal in one take
data/017298.wav|back in public domain also some other stuff
data/017531.wav|are you today is that it's a very weakening and less and less important part of the picture
data/019492.wav|the thing which is a word i just coined right there
data/008755.wav|it's big enough and he did he made a big deal and then
data/006399.wav|and then demanded those loans back
data/013934.wav|the cost of anything but technically you can pay later technically within a few weeks yes correct technically
data/025029.wav|as food and like pineapple on pizza are like the two things
data/025937.wav|people aren't really enjoying the competitive
data/028696.wav|when to california and i drove
data/000360.wav|it's me being bad possible me
data/024910.wav|didn't hit it last time which by and large is not true they have
data/001258.wav|i think he's one of the most funny
data/007611.wav|laughing let's get to the wins and fails
data/013531.wav|i have been doxie too much lately but his name
data/007524.wav|anyway uh that yeah original joe's was
data/026591.wav|if it had just been a quick phone call to
data/024772.wav|it's a big pit of friction they have to get rid
data/014190.wav|i think people have a lot of wrong information about who's actually winning and this is the best way to break it down okay except for
data/000638.wav|i had to buy some wedding stuff some like new
data/004850.wav|was ripped and stolen literally thousands of
data/021995.wav|or plans this morning burking uk as you may have
data/024818.wav|the best way to make sure of both your retention and your monetization is to make sure you have enough of an in-game economy in
data/020990.wav|it's said that he couldn't relate to the
data/014488.wav|what's next the last thing is what's next and for that i have
data/020369.wav|why why why even include that the whole
data/026414.wav|it's funny because car companies are so stuck in this
data/006581.wav|sweep just to get the last little bit so that's how they can afford the space lasers not because the movie's a
data/014932.wav|in the times bigger instead of million dollar deals
data/028051.wav|we will see how it plays out i'm i'm i'm hoping and praying that the fight continues
data/009963.wav|it's funny if anything i was late to the party because like that whole roast that happened like 10 days earlier
data/000816.wav|in shadow legends let's talk about
data/010242.wav|what will it take for your dad to be spooked by the internet i
data/031889.wav|when i first moved to arizona
data/032249.wav|he gets the banker cards he flips
data/012778.wav|well the middle and you can be like you can like go top and i'm like i'm a
data/023606.wav|out of control why pop's former good girl is suddenly
data/017217.wav|where i discuss the symptoms of in for
data/011256.wav|it'd be interesting is because they force them
data/018660.wav|i think about marketing a lot i got some opinions on it and i have some pretty strong opinions about what's about to happen with sony versus microsoft
data/027649.wav|but i will no longer be after he's going to pay me if
data/003687.wav|his lobbying and then um and then enforce it
data/004652.wav|it's like the meeting i don't want to do that
data/032047.wav|it's that's too far bro your set was school
data/016482.wav|and just a regular guy making low six figures obviously doing quite well for himself but very privileged but at the end of the day he wasn't a
data/016260.wav|it has been used 10 out of the 43 losses
data/000054.wav|to dozens of marking articles and i put together a marketing monday of course dude i sat there on a laptop in the
data/021488.wav|is dollars even if it's here why don't the hedge funds just hold on so here's the deal
data/014318.wav|there is no problem it is extremely valuable and the fact that
data/027361.wav|i think it would be difficult or challenging what makes a
data/030060.wav|alright i'll tell you that let
data/024609.wav|it went forward a thousand years with the release of fortnite
data/000424.wav|in the thing is it didn't matter that they were making fun of me it didn't matter that i was being laughed at it didn't matter that i was annoying them because i was winning every single one
data/000647.wav|the beating us at craps they start beating
data/016170.wav|and that's how i stay fit and get and get around
data/003643.wav|our current economic system outside of money and politics
data/018288.wav|i always have a cup for whoever
data/027298.wav|if people don't watch the same shows anymore
data/011836.wav|the actors so you know my bar was low and when i got on the ship for the first time i was impressed because i'm walking around and the other this is the key thing the other humans haven't shown up yet
data/032350.wav|with the developer next to me
data/009853.wav|and so you see like when they build a stadium they have to buy like
data/010047.wav|puppet from mr putin you're the one who's doing all the
data/013870.wav|friend points guaranteed if you find that clip from the video
data/002109.wav|actually let's find the clip right now let's find
data/005167.wav|and you know what it's confirmed in the
data/015511.wav|the spoiled rich kid who got really into designing shirts and the shirts all had money bags on
data/004399.wav|i will rep that jersey for sure
data/009223.wav|by that i mean 14 months
data/021446.wav|the the odds are are not on your side there are a lot of forces including human nature against you making out with the
data/000104.wav|for helping support the content i've noticed and appreciate you for it
data/028120.wav|that was the plan they announced late last year
data/020272.wav|i'm in that range i like it this is not a holiday
data/018743.wav|and my theory which i think has been
data/016273.wav|for the lakers but let's flip it back to
data/031079.wav|and i'd seen people who grew and people who
data/022967.wav|apple said the epic game store will not
data/020308.wav|it part of the show this is a good ad on a lot of levels
data/010533.wav|i got the beginning kitty we're
data/012830.wav|for lud now it's so crazy but this
data/010045.wav|so mr president hear me when i say look out your window there's kids in cages
data/020811.wav|we'll heroes of society the marketers yes i wasted time raising
data/022711.wav|starting with microsoft buying nokia in
data/009127.wav|mildly critical of notorious fraudster elon musk
data/021953.wav|way too expensive and it really is
data/021545.wav|yeah it will say is elon's goofy ass dude
data/017647.wav|as a consumer and that is where the extra advertising money has has gone instead of spending on advertising they're spending on
data/011778.wav|with the dangerous combination it's dangerous
data/031302.wav|this bodega we get to the bodega and i take a water bottle and it's cold and it's good and
data/021712.wav|one remembers as a toyota ad
data/031418.wav|well football you know just three guys like touch grass
data/024582.wav|on lawyers and legal fees and everything for this trial they have to spend
data/027886.wav|for the longest time it's been considered that
data/029305.wav|i the having a meeting with a bunch of people from riot
data/025936.wav|into other areas that might make it more entertaining
data/028488.wav|and this kid never knew this kid never knew i was there and he turns around and
data/018871.wav|at the idea that everyone would think the way LeBron delivered this line is very
data/017682.wav|made a conscious effort to really focus on making it a a
data/020120.wav|a lot of options let's someone had a good
data/020469.wav|launch so it sold a ton and
data/003692.wav|and i understand that like because we haven't seen we haven't seen good progress
data/010560.wav|if you're literally asking me to do like heroin i would rat cutie if you came
data/010570.wav|my stream to stop this cat from getting out there other people
data/015407.wav|they used to be able to sell you the same thing like four times so i
data/017562.wav|the past to be sure but in fact if you look at it this is how much apple spent on advertising less than a billion dollars versus samsung
data/030716.wav|telling you that france made the statue of liberty
data/024598.wav|with this past week it's this tomorrow war truck driving around japan to promote the movie you know it's definitely
data/003537.wav|we're seeing opportunities to get houses at at more affordable prices but a lot of places are slow to respond
data/012497.wav|for two of us so 2500
data/005458.wav|this one i did look a little drunk i won't be honest with you i wasn't even drunk but
data/015908.wav|we cheap much like how uber is losing money hand over fist all streaming services are burning money they're spending so much money on content and they're not making it back yet and so
data/004193.wav|on the line all you know
data/031433.wav|it's a perfect photo as you can see i'm scoping out who's open ludwig doesn't have the form
data/022212.wav|if they sold whatever he was wearing that would be the best out of all time
data/017740.wav|you could apply this to a brand like
data/026294.wav|we've built a brand as a company where you're you're more likely
data/009269.wav|going to win the vote mr peace or ninja get
data/005259.wav|the like directing it he's making a bigger
data/031296.wav|thing tomorrow i i literally can't be stopped there is not a thing on earth i
data/008777.wav|yeah there's just he's on very weak legal grounds
data/025863.wav|same thing for hearthstone but when toast try to do it they said no only if you've never played hearthstone will we pay you if we've already got you playing hearthstone you to get shit same thing for hearthstone but when toast tried to do it they said no only if you've never played hearthstone will we pay you
data/000426.wav|it would deal the cards i would win 600
data/020008.wav|i think about yeah again i i wanted to include more scale examples because it's hard to think like 30 billion
data/011123.wav|so i'm constantly lowering and turning the
data/003354.wav|the on mortgages then we have a real 2009 type
data/018851.wav|is your mascot right he's clearly in love with this girl he's reminiscing about her
data/019423.wav|the funny and entertaining and everyone's
data/001916.wav|it's criminal what happens to the people uh job creators like
data/013869.wav|i can give it to me i will give you 1 000
data/021437.wav|i think that's super funny and i'm on
data/024874.wav|a study or a survey and they they asked them
data/000567.wav|get player cards show up to tables individually bet for a little bit but not lose it then cash out and give it to the next person so they all have a lot of money on their player card all tracked but
data/020353.wav|i didn't want to get one but then my girlfriend and i were like we're
data/016896.wav|are what twitch has made dumb decisions
data/011085.wav|it's always been quiet for as long as i've watched you it's always been quiet nah
data/029060.wav|i need a ride home mom mommy can you come pick me up from
data/011874.wav|and i did not know this going in it is a
data/025965.wav|people but you can't hire anybody blizzard generally relied on the blizzard
data/018976.wav|their competition was this this and this was so much better than anything quibby had ever thought of ever
data/029985.wav|number one it wasn't because he
data/013735.wav|yeah he called a public terrorist threat
data/026917.wav|all the all electric the bmw i all electric all electric the bmw ix
data/007987.wav|with every time i bring it up they're like they
data/000189.wav|with the tiger and i was just kind of laughing about it and everyone in the
data/003032.wav|we're fine we're fine no one
data/007400.wav|but it was it was it was rowdy in there it was packed and it was rowdy
data/013899.wav|feeding you broccoli oh my god thank you i thought
data/031933.wav|told him to to delay she said basically drive in circles like just go around around like 10 blocks just
data/018780.wav|which sort of dominates all the competition in fact it dominates dare i
data/023096.wav|together in there and there's no way of untangling it and so when we think we're only isolating based on taste we're really using a variety of things
data/023696.wav|that's like when i ask a rhetorical
data/011419.wav|same without him for real congratulations
data/003299.wav|i get kind of serious for
data/008576.wav|pretty obviously in the right i think if you were to simplify it the example i would say is like
data/019441.wav|the tone of the barbershop style
data/029619.wav|and like he's just different he does not find himself by his record vs yes i said non don't do that is that and like he's just different yeah he does not define himself by his record verses
data/019977.wav|make great movies but they hired the talent from pixar to run disney animation there's pretty much no doubt in my mind that frozen would not have been created if they hadn't bought pixar pixar changed the whole culture of disney and ended up pleasing to the massive
data/008318.wav|i believe we are currently today in a recession
data/025689.wav|highest marketing title at sony said
data/029779.wav|and and just from me on the outside not knowing too much about the
data/005679.wav|say the story as an outsider who still had a
data/025126.wav|the fired if you don't try this game which
data/025821.wav|so the show was so good
data/019430.wav|the name and the call to action
data/010944.wav|drawing delicious meal and eating it on
data/032007.wav|in the scarf for not keeping up with melee but
data/024566.wav|and so apple really does not want it to get off the payment system because then they'd have to actually follow
data/002500.wav|walking around cities and there's these dueling competing coffee shops
data/004904.wav|was it to go into motion he backed out he
data/021803.wav|you know what i was gonna
data/005965.wav|it's the like the soy guy
data/024313.wav|this is the motor city this is what we do
data/028675.wav|two years later in the peak of the amazon era you would be fired obviously you can't
data/017140.wav|my taxes yeah if you were
data/000541.wav|is the craziest thing this was i mean
data/000004.wav|is that i chugged a bunch of red bulls
data/028638.wav|and he he comes into my desk he's like dude
data/004128.wav|if they don't know they should
data/022318.wav|or we could shut them all down
data/009677.wav|ignorance is bliss dude ignorance is
data/027495.wav|it needs a change so you might think i might be against this for monopoly reasons but i'm really not but before we get into all my takes on it let's do a quick disclosure on some of the facts the deal is worth
data/011474.wav|you know but also you have to be like you know
data/028270.wav|as companies um until from from
data/000682.wav|it's a new it's brand new
data/026438.wav|it is important when you buy a sub from
data/016787.wav|we'll do our part even though you know i think
data/021915.wav|i invited my family on to
data/003516.wav|if everything that's happening now has
data/016678.wav|you are in a growing industry something that's
data/030360.wav|yeah told chat like almost the
data/010932.wav|and a limited edition minions cheese
data/017549.wav|they are nowhere close to what apple has accomplished in the
data/013728.wav|and i'm not trying to get sued because i
data/013541.wav|but he would do it all the time like a hundred like like
data/019887.wav|and peter molyneux who is the game director of fable
data/015319.wav|book sales business and your and all that
data/004391.wav|i got this dm just during the
data/004035.wav|wait a little bit elderly while
data/030236.wav|the real question is why is lud wearing
data/010667.wav|have you jerks might have taken the name
data/027590.wav|and you realize that trump owns a competing social platform called truth social that he's trying to prop up even though it is
data/011462.wav|so long and if you at all interested in like banger
data/030025.wav|i want to keep dr lupo safe he's been
data/005398.wav|in youtubers that featured ryan trahan
data/025866.wav|get outlook is what it is later in
data/018457.wav|was guy and i was like
data/008786.wav|so now the court if they actually went through with it would have to force not only
data/021190.wav|exactly where i am this is the largest
data/001203.wav|i felt grossed out and i never really wanted like it was so it didn't it didn't even
data/019381.wav|that i would use and we kept
data/018928.wav|well qualified and she said well you know i don't even
data/016466.wav|get into the main wayne pink rats his
data/021926.wav|take money from my real life i had to lose money on twitch i lost money for the first six months i think
data/016747.wav|if the the this and people have knowledge in this and people that have knowledge
data/022546.wav|of a bad one this is kind of
data/010013.wav|and then obviously i switched it but it was bullying okay and i want that to be well understood
data/008851.wav|twitter is suing him to make him do yeah yeah he could do it if
data/027877.wav|i think of like um let's
data/024935.wav|don't like to compete on skill they would like to compete on luck time invested and money spent they prefer a world where either they can put
data/003683.wav|and they've gotten way good at getting around it
data/016814.wav|it and no one had the phone
data/010413.wav|and like a legal barrier to anyone else setting up a competition
data/020198.wav|this is going to be a slam dunk within five minutes it was clear that people weren't going to harp on about the time they got a free extra sauce with their mcnuggets instead they were going to tell
data/016518.wav|and that is the rise of
data/029703.wav|we're a little bit and he beats my ass like like i've nev like
data/019966.wav|isn't the buying pixar and at first he says no hell no of course not there's no way
data/015905.wav|it'd be better what i'm here to say is that um
data/017841.wav|i have focused more on this riot games is not particularly better at advertising league of legends than anyone else but purchase and post purchase
data/000242.wav|but thankfully thankfully for the table we're mostly winning i mean we're doing
data/004408.wav|first off and then i will have my guest appearance
data/015603.wav|and guess what everyone's kind of getting broke you know the the market is bifurcating
data/020408.wav|be funny is that this guy's a
data/020525.wav|and i i like this a lot so they're doing refunds
data/002343.wav|i guess i mean i guess so i've always made that argument
data/014492.wav|and really there was no way to get around it
data/004157.wav|if the the god he feels shame for you
data/001726.wav|he's a degenerate gambler and he's going home
data/012270.wav|it's a back table which has actual buttons like
data/004520.wav|one questions that it's just like come on make
data/030055.wav|and i will prove this with my sat score
data/024988.wav|we are going to make everyone look for your state and see the most hated
data/004944.wav|the way disaster there if if for whatever reason
data/019680.wav|if they get a chance to after this but
data/017504.wav|wanted to include this song which is good i'll
data/002740.wav|what a deal there is no way that
data/032175.wav|chip in a chair gives me a
data/031195.wav|well it wasn't very funny or interesting so it wasn't but now ludwig has shown how to do it
data/020871.wav|i'm gonna try to explain it really simple
data/012321.wav|working space pizza and it's like that's i'm not
data/028036.wav|society here and when things tilt towards the winds eventually it comes back and i do want to say we are due for the empire striking back

data/027872.wav|we to buy calls on this stock uh
data/005432.wav|trump to this joke everything is planned now that i've spoken to
data/008743.wav|twitter and was like secretly trying to buy it they were quite concerned and didn't want him to and he was tweeting things like
data/000679.wav|i think we have some photos let me see okay yeah i'll show you
data/014785.wav|and receive invoices which is dope for me

data/001345.wav|it's awesome that was smooth smooth as silk
data/005856.wav|we all of it i think that's all of it uh
data/016065.wav|and his marketing nickname that his fans
data/019493.wav|that advertising in general is just becoming a tax on the poor it's becoming a world where you can avoid almost all ads it used to be pervasive
data/021542.wav|which means amazon tests are going down
data/024193.wav|the real showdown between youtube gaming and twitch a lot more
data/020719.wav|if the thread on the importance of fighting misinformation about what good data is about what
data/009005.wav|by step with an elon tweet
data/003170.wav|is tick tock and this is the biggest problem of all because it's cutting into their current profits not just their future
data/005588.wav|so much waste there's so much waste
data/020485.wav|within their claim to fame but they've made a lot more than that okay they also made the
data/017346.wav|so technically when i'm making money right now on twitch i am making amazon money who dat works for amazon unfortunately why does
data/017179.wav|and i'm gonna use it i'm gonna use it
data/010208.wav|i was in the shower and i was like i don't think i can handle
data/020236.wav|stop that's enough business for today thank you for attending my seminar
data/005064.wav|with the cool that the richest people on earth are flouting the legal system
data/022588.wav|your movement bro so many kids would
data/010400.wav|with the country where the government
data/016275.wav|for big promises if there's one thing gamers love and i think you guys will agree with me wait i think
data/015733.wav|and it's applying to basically everybody but netflix and they're starting to freak out
data/027621.wav|the narrative in many non-chinese countries now jeff bezos is probably not the right
data/018774.wav|and investors were nervous so they showed a picture of a mountain and said elder scrolls
data/019950.wav|what to this is because my honest opinion and theory is that from a marketing
data/001475.wav|mean this could be a good thing but i
data/019338.wav|we had as you can see in this graph
data/013527.wav|match with him didn't teach me the controls
data/009568.wav|advantage i know she's good at league but i mean double again there's levels
data/026094.wav|the people seeing drinking have a ruinous impact on their parents was a major response people saw drinking have an impact on their parents and they didn't
data/004011.wav|in crushing at tft i think he's really high
data/004015.wav|want a good guy check him out
data/004451.wav|today i feel like you never get thanked
data/026790.wav|i basically the high net worth high spend users they are all completely churned off of
data/015525.wav|top talent because to me it seems like they just want to kick it with hollywood they've got the money they think it's cool they know that amazon's doing
data/006038.wav|your chat doesn't let me use the
data/023704.wav|for you this is predatory obviously but at some point
data/016971.wav|and then we'll knock out a
data/028683.wav|if the for you okay anyway it's a wild story i really never thought i'd end up where i
data/013296.wav|your plus you're going to match
data/014104.wav|what the computer for maybe an hour and i have like
data/022443.wav|the android because the color of your bubbles will change the simple fact that you get a blue
data/012750.wav|from my bachelor party and my wedding my
data/021463.wav|we have today like the the hedge funds if gamestop stock
data/012675.wav|elden ring and then i want to do ori and then maybe
data/009776.wav|with the world we are in a really really really crazy time and i think the next couple
data/000795.wav|a big chunk of that i give it to
data/031325.wav|i'm so sorry and they're like apparently that bodega has a high shoplifting rate and so because shoplifting is a problem
data/029997.wav|we got as big as you did you had like every single one by the
data/027386.wav|what they have to they have to because roblox is that big
data/007898.wav|versus dwayne quote the rock quote johnson okay
data/016782.wav|the largest age cohort right now is
data/003470.wav|well informed in an interesting way
data/008172.wav|this was before they started the lcs so
data/002712.wav|i take the hundred ten dollars that's a pretty big payout for just randomly
data/007147.wav|you shouldn't nobody wants to get it even if you're not going to kill me
data/029377.wav|well it really can respect and love elon musk
data/015580.wav|isn't your tv it's very popular roku
data/001242.wav|it's not so wild that someone would get fired but it's like not so boring or bland that it gets no engagement like it's fun they have fun questions they
data/016862.wav|at this rate and then since 2010
data/014236.wav|up and coming streamers people are like i know a lot of people in this very chat have watched like ludwig's videos on
data/010539.wav|you're interested in so i i didn't even bother to ask
data/030250.wav|we'd watch movies we'd order food i did that all the time it was great it was a fantastic first part of the holiday
data/020116.wav|we're going to watch interesting videos that's the idea
data/025601.wav|if the the job let's get to my next win i have two wins
data/016046.wav|there so i'm thinking about doing that but until the
data/025910.wav|a blizzard event and said freedom for hong kong the glorious revolution of our age something like that
data/016148.wav|solid bad good i want to hear it i want to know
data/026913.wav|want to put it easily in the uh pretty
data/021945.wav|of strategy as doing hard things i have been in a meeting i remember when i was
data/010559.wav|i worked out today i was at the pool a little bit i have no desire no you're literally
data/027443.wav|calling it a jingle but i have to do a jingle they want me to rap about mexican pizza so i just want to give you a heads up before you
data/011149.wav|people trying to steal my other ones so
data/011780.wav|so anyway we go down this long gray
data/002549.wav|as you didn't have before could be yours do you double down and go for one more again the time is ticking
data/002372.wav|broke me because i had to wake up just a few hours later for breakfast and i couldn't get back to sleep and it threw off my
data/010556.wav|i absolutely do not want to play
data/011611.wav|i don't know what i'm talking about today
data/018782.wav|i learned anything from today's marketing monday it's that whether or not you care about
data/026326.wav|in dollars to open this is
data/031309.wav|i want to break this 20 for this water
data/003458.wav|you have china for whatever reason that wouldn't be able to to make the chips they need to function in the modern economy so it's very very important strategic importance lunch like taiwan you know we need to defend it because raw democracy it's like that that's the you have china for whatever reason they wouldn't be able to to make the chips they need to function in the modern economy so it's very very impo it's strategically
data/008274.wav|it's like wait a minute that guy's so good
data/018515.wav|it's competitors by having more exclusive content how
data/002354.wav|i have a lot of options to watch it at your leisure
data/000117.wav|how long has your beard gotten in your
data/014833.wav|was or them buying them for themselves i'm
data/020900.wav|ten years away and like that usually ends up being longer okay real estate is not a good place to start this is based because boomers
data/024633.wav|maybe it's all gonna be cocaine
data/003725.wav|by cutting back on private label and they're doing it very i mean they're doing way less
data/012156.wav|way way nothing else everything else that we
data/009355.wav|yeah i remember that guy it's crazy as
data/011111.wav|and you know that they're fake you
data/003207.wav|in the philippines it's kind of the biggest example of pay to earn type crypto gameplay
data/003670.wav|has incredible advantages from wealth and go to a better school and get seed funding and has connections that they
data/025542.wav|if a lot of other labor action across the country there was a number of strikes in in
data/012897.wav|yeah a free pair of tickets to the season 3 world championships
data/026291.wav|for example nike is a company
data/019900.wav|i was wondering i was like why did you guys
data/027297.wav|if the is getting more and more micro news people
data/004563.wav|i just a tad just just
data/031710.wav|well he's getting a couple couple
data/029106.wav|was this time knowing where i came from i was hustling all over
data/026568.wav|was trademarked oh yeah i forgot i will sue
data/002820.wav|and of course love me some musk danielle
data/006089.wav|no the joke is that he lost he lost and still popped off like he won to counter the fact that
data/025650.wav|i do have a fail for a couple
data/024113.wav|as sedan you have been seen hyundai sees
data/011472.wav|when your friends do well you don't want
data/010913.wav|by the way i purchased this shirt myself
data/015769.wav|it's not brand appropriate for disney plus or content that is under weird contracts that can't be on disney for example i think like
data/016000.wav|that's when prices go way up
data/027936.wav|you did want to consider getting involved in investing and perhaps more safer stocks or maybe you just want to test your brain and invest small fractional parts of money just to see how things would do perhaps
data/010084.wav|it's been awesome it's been a real
data/031587.wav|this is the last big match of starcraft ever
data/020312.wav|be something in it and you guys will spam that person should die we can't not we
data/011674.wav|here's the thing though before i before i go into it i want you guys
data/011285.wav|i interesting theory but is wrong but as fun sent me an invite yeah i interesting theory but it's wrong but that's fun
data/005092.wav|on there and i also use it for content almost every month and so i thought i'd begin this best tweets by just saying i despise instagram accounts that post screenshots of funny tweets you want to see a funny tweet come here and sift
data/008584.wav|that from you and you say no you say no you can't buy it from me i want to keep it which is what happened by the way twitter fought tooth and nail for him to not buy them then you go
data/031468.wav|so yeah there was like this fancy ass plate ready there then
data/008931.wav|but it's going to play well with the court and i think they're i think i mean i
data/025629.wav|what are you microsoft if you remember last week on marketing monday i announced that sony had a record
data/002631.wav|now if he gets it again not only will i go to a hundred
data/015489.wav|if they were fully committed they'd be almost unstoppable because they have the best ip in the world but they're not
data/012917.wav|so the the hardest number that i had to my name was that i grew the accounts from like 0 to
data/027586.wav|if you understand so much so far it's that
data/021791.wav|it's a little bit slower pace a little bit
data/019179.wav|in public and the people at large basically revolted and the
data/010814.wav|that's fine only family friendly night i
data/014369.wav|hold their interest in marketing and launch on twitch because they were able to do drops and dominate the conversation
data/021335.wav|ideally as like a group of nations be aware that you are not alone if you feel this way you are you might feel alone you are actually among a very fast growing group okay it is not a rare feeling to feel a little more isolated a little more alone lately i thought i would make my final prediction and i think it's a powerful
data/010241.wav|he laughed out loud and he's like no but
data/011288.wav|let me tell you it's going to be a little bit embarrassing when you lose on the first round but that's okay nope everyone
data/015879.wav|what i'm starting my own streaming services
data/010162.wav|i didn't i didn't really like it
data/019600.wav|i'm loving it right yes okay and then the creative agency in germany responsible for the campaign said pusha t had no involvement they said
data/000278.wav|so he had promised the hotel that it was going to be a group of all youtubers that were going to spend
data/020405.wav|at this elf what is what is this playful
data/024237.wav|and then yes that was probably actually
data/026485.wav|it didn't own the rights so i already
data/023944.wav|to the controversy from the last thing he did so he just keeps doing things
data/028043.wav|there are publicizing it all over to try and scare stores
data/024478.wav|we ad space to make an ad that's more forgettable and expensive with
data/019420.wav|at walt disney i didn't you
data/014541.wav|i think we need this room
data/025645.wav|with fan-made projects the rubber met the road the rock met the hard place nintendo's lawyers strike again this time against a mario
data/004407.wav|of marketing stuff lots of stuff to talk about i'll be doing wins
data/008977.wav|that's the only argument that he really that holds any water is like the company's different it's different than what i paid for i
data/024200.wav|i to see like what does it actually mean
data/005029.wav|so in fact we'll get rid of all friends
data/014291.wav|what wait wait hold hold hold hold hold
data/017635.wav|a comparison remember how i said verizon spends three times as much on
data/018227.wav|they they threw in this at the end but
data/016359.wav|went to fraud basically just to get fraudsters to buy
data/016484.wav|extremely well connected he had a document land on his desk
data/028451.wav|well to this okay i got subway sandwich and laced potato
data/014679.wav|guys look who's what is this
data/009274.wav|what the hell is this are these in-stream ads i have twitch prime or i have
data/026404.wav|but or packaging this focus vastly increased market share and
data/018763.wav|where android is cheaper and has more market share but
data/020607.wav|the greatest jingle rider of all time also has the stage presence of a god
data/010819.wav|sounds to me like i should play like a horror game if
data/031191.wav|it's going and you think about it that's how
data/015326.wav|true story and so to hedge their bets because the boss is asking they didn't just go for one they went for two and they spent a billion dollars alone on lord of the rings then they
data/007848.wav|here's the deal marketing monday shirt
data/028338.wav|now i'm watching everyone in the area
data/016193.wav|you know the whole thing the whole thing the
data/011728.wav|let me tell you let me tell you see these guys in blue so this is important there is two types of staff at the galactic star cruiser that i that we stayed at
data/026971.wav|every criticism the one and only larry david really surprised people
data/031701.wav|wait there's no shot at works because he'll
data/030772.wav|i mean yes for sure but this is your one time
data/031378.wav|well stock for it so that's day one day two he says
data/025364.wav|why you but in my mind i'm sort of like bro
data/026704.wav|as remember a few months ago the activision blizzard
data/009969.wav|the it but i do think he's he's he's
data/020021.wav|i realize it was a youth medium and not a regular medium i will have to slim down a bit i'll have to stop eating so many
data/017952.wav|if the the first one to really deeply invest in this not just commercials saying their pizza
data/005952.wav|like angry angry that something like
data/012592.wav|we've got a broad base of incomes and good ip so they're probably set pretty well for
data/003371.wav|to my man magnus carlsen okay if you
data/027438.wav|this past week i saw the worst influencer campaign of all time
data/025313.wav|and if you've made any money off
data/031979.wav|dude i actually think there's this guy that that that gets our sense of humor at a very deep level that i'm going to reach out to we're going to hire him
data/019018.wav|everywhere at once do you need them to be at a mcdonald's there they are the travel costs of getting a bunch of influencers out to shanghai paying for their hotel paying for their flights paying for them to do social
data/003474.wav|at the dog in actually what if
data/022262.wav|as he was disqualified immediately for
data/026566.wav|thinking of starting something called merchandising monday totally original thoughts go for it bro you can call it marketing monday
data/013534.wav|all the new employees that were like in or around his team would like invite them to do like uh you know just a
data/026371.wav|he percent of them said they were very slash extremely satisfied after their visit these are unheard of numbers in the world of
data/001051.wav|all day every day for years just years and years of dota and then
data/018781.wav|i say the globe and so the real takeaway chat if
data/010869.wav|take a drink again i ever never sip
data/015311.wav|it's legacies of amazing content one of those powerful studios in hollywood history and
data/023156.wav|be on social media you know what i'm saying like you get these burgers in real life and they're they're all talk they're
data/008271.wav|and it's the first time people got to see like someone
data/008360.wav|i wouldn't worry about him i i think you yeah i would worry about
data/019628.wav|jingle i would love the story i wonder if i
data/005339.wav|well anyway it was it was very very funny and
data/010772.wav|i have a theory that if you open up any individual person's twitch chat
data/023981.wav|the money they are not stupid okay i
data/024385.wav|what we didn't like it they actually built new york city for that
data/028350.wav|in front of his son in

data/024611.wav|and i believe a 1 000
data/012089.wav|we're like super good and i was recognized
data/006758.wav|if the the do that that'd be really really fun i'm super duper down
data/030331.wav|it can i get some sevens for young
data/018266.wav|dogs having to drive to the vet over and over and really it takes a special chef to cook all those ingredients into one
data/005018.wav|you guys with subscribers and i purchase twitter on the dip okay i'll do a handshake deal with
data/009626.wav|you probably will if you watched my zero to hero
data/029027.wav|and bigger than me and we were friends but we both liked the same girl and we both were kind of arguing
data/017887.wav|every year becomes less valuable people just don't watch
data/014984.wav|at a factor in we are gonna dive
data/001745.wav|the guys very polite nice day isn't it yeah the weather's great and then in the middle conversation he goes whoa and he falls over the side and then the short story shifts to the
data/022081.wav|we have in the fridge bank account you don't
data/027792.wav|a little bit and talking about raising them more is what's
data/011473.wav|are your friends to be all miserable and sad
data/009954.wav|i think of that 20 though
data/001561.wav|or the americans in my chat
data/005195.wav|in my closet and i wore it and then uh
data/013966.wav|if you buy something and it arrives
data/007483.wav|anyway taffo's like my old melee coach
data/032154.wav|i dropped it on the field now
data/013142.wav|just take league of legends in
data/006658.wav|compared to like compare the seven hours i spent on teresa in my mind in my mind
data/020834.wav|and that my friends is the end of the marketing monday awards i hope you enjoyed
data/013477.wav|what can you feel bad about
data/003523.wav|yeah yeah i think there's just a long history of everybody thinking they live in the end of times everybody thinking that their unique problems were
data/022116.wav|can i please offer you a hug we're
data/001920.wav|walk away with 20 cents that he didn't really
data/008746.wav|refer to take over the company which he
data/032104.wav|you know i don't know how that knight
data/018857.wav|thirstiest time of the year sprite
data/018912.wav|you would pick first up right off the bat okay and that's jeffrey katzenberg jeffrey katzenberg a man in his
data/024325.wav|it requires eminem to leave his house is
data/000882.wav|well okay i am doing well i'm doing well enough to negotiate here
data/008374.wav|i talk about banks we talked about it on the
data/000021.wav|no thanks only pepsi what do you mean the trick the trick is to keep walking
data/028102.wav|if you guys don't know china's continuing its
data/015307.wav|if he lives there i'm pretty sure he
data/025033.wav|which is just a declaration of war really taco bell
data/002946.wav|i like a little bit more
data/007018.wav|too much sour candy to be honest but anyway
data/013592.wav|i ought to be louder here i gotta
data/029031.wav|and the rest of the group
data/019004.wav|it is certainly interesting as a marketer because her engagement numbers right from the beginning were off the
data/027656.wav|this company around and massively increase
data/002642.wav|how will i do this oh i've got a perfect idea
data/019637.wav|if you're on twitch we got a
data/031113.wav|it was the spark but really it was all the time me and him played portal together for when he had
data/019596.wav|ban them quack can you find them stupidest thing i've
data/010287.wav|while guys tournament it's like of course cutie cinderella yes
data/010476.wav|and alternatively if i said i did want
data/010297.wav|in ross i will of course ask him do you think i'm
data/030877.wav|vibrant youthful match i was just saying
data/006767.wav|let's gang up on that damn luca and
data/011075.wav|not true not true my friend uh another
data/017618.wav|is one of the big many things they've done but uh the
data/007633.wav|does it mean i'm like a
data/027358.wav|and then things that are kind of potentially
data/028544.wav|the skateboard my skateboard had like like a
data/000182.wav|what we drank so much so
data/003557.wav|case i would just tell you you know take more time
data/007252.wav|help i'm happy to help but i'm not trying to
data/025525.wav|one of the biggest obstacles to sony's success is the fact that microsoft
data/026021.wav|he slams the front of his head as hard as he can against the table as he realizes how much he's being charged
data/029903.wav|we are to actually be friends and thank god for
data/013510.wav|perfect balance in the middle i am literally
data/018238.wav|so we're gonna need a bigger one is that that's something huh okay i get that i'm
data/000652.wav|down but my friends didn't know even though
data/009509.wav|it's that was their only chance this is
data/000595.wav|instantly high because we took it like a half hour ago i start falling asleep
data/000225.wav|one of the best drinks i've ever had in my
data/027352.wav|use this for almost any brand i've used this in
data/002282.wav|put you in jail even better for your career yeah exactly
data/017032.wav|it just get into the business world and you
data/021813.wav|of business and life advice and all
data/027589.wav|to a little bit more because when you actually read his statements
data/026147.wav|threat to their conference he uploaded a sex game to roblox use slurs so
data/021854.wav|this is amazon stock price over the years you might notice from when it was founded in
data/005283.wav|whatever fine i you know it's not my prerogative i get i get a text saying hey you know
data/016395.wav|we have existed to benefit either either
data/031104.wav|he'll make more than us combined i remember saying that and that was back when he had like no viewers and that's not something you say about somebody that's going to be
data/009324.wav|called console no shot zero percent i'll i'll stake it i'll bet anyone that
data/020148.wav|way to get a good amount of engagement features oreo in it it's kind of cheeky and funny this is
data/026546.wav|if think ideas and features will get you nowhere and then i looked at his tweets
data/022168.wav|and i was like damn that is you really took it to that next level huh that's emotionally manipulative and they played that ad everywhere it probably
data/012350.wav|i could drink i want for five wrecks but
data/010107.wav|that i'm good to go if there's anything i need to put on screen or anything for that i don't think so but
data/001014.wav|if you want to be healthy wealthy and wise you'll sign up for factor right now
data/009139.wav|the praise and they loved it they weren't even responding to the facts of the
data/023506.wav|formula one sponsorships and major race influencers and
data/025874.wav|be a little nicer he's gonna
data/004396.wav|then i got a ps you don't
data/003671.wav|they succeed anyway like even though the
data/026827.wav|every single ad top to bottom from
data/018807.wav|and rewatch it's a little crunch but for the time this has set apple's marketing strategy for the next three decades they're the outsider
data/030856.wav|what is that and we'd love to hire you is that
data/022946.wav|wait why later but generally if you're arguing between a trillion dollar company and a billion dollar company
data/015426.wav|they have a deeper bench than everyone else
data/000110.wav|when your friends and it was like through
data/014311.wav|at all levels and it incentivizes people to start
data/027428.wav|i get myself i got some weird promoted tweets
data/010491.wav|be for my life i would kill for a firefly movie no i'm sorry
data/023618.wav|dr squatch so okay i've been using these
data/019528.wav|did you say sex sells cutie
data/028071.wav|i just always makes me think i i really like
data/009109.wav|where i don't curse at all she might be older okay what do you mean
data/005771.wav|i was talking about numbers this is a real story that happened and i
data/027006.wav|i think if we get to next year a lot of these
data/005669.wav|every big streamer is extremely aware of their numbers and everyone else's numbers in a way that i didn't know like i i obviously like i know if i if i have a good
data/016425.wav|at the hard assets the people that were close to the government and the
data/007043.wav|i have literally she'll drop uh
data/008256.wav|basically where you can sort of
data/019592.wav|or canadian they're all canadian it's a canadian band they hired to be the
data/017945.wav|it's no secret that a fancy restaurant is not selling you food that is like four or five times better ingredients than a less fancy place but they can charge four or five times the price generally by by increasing the the value of the
data/011297.wav|the fall of an empire live
data/025940.wav|not only from the player base but from the developer like valve
data/006192.wav|then of course i'll be leaving
data/021061.wav|like they already have a low quality brand and they just associated it with your
data/026126.wav|literally one of the worst ceos you
data/005696.wav|and yeah he's he's he's like really funny
data/031070.wav|we were huddled in a corner of
data/029234.wav|okay okay cool i i can do this i can do this
data/007951.wav|but he said it a couple
data/003100.wav|and but guess who's not feeling this
data/017287.wav|his head as hard as he can against the table as he realizes how much he's being charged it is as far as he knows the only way to have a cell phone because he hasn't yet switched to mint mobile
data/000838.wav|if the first that was his first big weird stream
data/013423.wav|what all the time so i take my cues from the youth
data/015670.wav|the not going to a t v shows they can do what tv shows they can do
data/004796.wav|if the contract which stipulates that there is a one billion dollar breakup fee that if for whatever reason the deal doesn't happen if if whatever act of god stops the deal
data/017228.wav|it's been dealt with so some guy at pbr
data/004327.wav|money i guess but i don't
data/010921.wav|it's a little more of like uh
data/012119.wav|learn okay learn to work together on
data/020912.wav|the real thing is to get mommy's cc and those three little cute numbers
data/007735.wav|well he allowed to go to his house and ask for it
data/019903.wav|now number one it's time for number one of the top
data/018388.wav|you're saying that they can only afford to pay you a thousand dollars a month that's not true
data/023430.wav|you have a lot more energy and people want to be around you more and low energy just sucks circumstances but i i would say for most people that i
data/014780.wav|in comes to write off all the things that related to your side hustle so if you
data/028759.wav|with the opportunity i said yes yes she was like
data/006853.wav|would you ever do an irl gym stream
data/004042.wav|cause i would have been miserable it was so god damned goddamned annoying
data/009593.wav|it's not a big deal team ninja is still
data/004388.wav|you'd have in mind is me being like cool okay that's what i want picture that because that was my first reaction to this dm today from a person probably
data/008160.wav|if the the gaming than work this weekend
data/028364.wav|if you want to seem smart in a meeting what you say is well we need to find the
data/006881.wav|the the throwing around 10 000
data/018830.wav|it's not involved in his journey at all what I would really like if
data/021595.wav|i just realized you talked about unethical wall street is for an hour while wearing
data/019891.wav|if it was outright said to be linear as
data/006410.wav|we're about to go vest was given two choices you
data/001337.wav|i guess it was kind of fast
data/026988.wav|in the past making it seem like history is on your side i mean that's all
data/010018.wav|i wouldn't call you a virgin
data/012969.wav|with the article about dude we have a massive teacher shortage in america
data/020579.wav|he has to fix the vodka
data/004935.wav|as obligated to pay the only way that
data/017404.wav|somebody had put an image of jake hurwitz from college humor just in there it's i think it's like it's if you search hrx it's somewhere in here
data/017715.wav|or truck okay it's a product that doesn't need to pay for
data/016709.wav|the infrastructure hopefully you know but the
data/029037.wav|and i go spinning backwards like he
data/019629.wav|if i get in touch with him and just ask him
data/018820.wav|why does she pack these things
data/019923.wav|the forefront of pioneering new game stuff because of the biggest selling so by the time what
data/010008.wav|who's better pay the musician or
data/011698.wav|visual representations of what's going on
data/010928.wav|you will get two movie tickets to minions
data/031667.wav|but you know it's like i'm walking around
data/001153.wav|your whenever you're good your brain is so rotted you thought factor sponsored mangle and gave him a
data/028779.wav|the other odd jobs like really if you added
data/027440.wav|which would have been cringe enough before it went up she posted this on
data/000790.wav|there's no reason i can't pay even though it's my bachelor party i wanted to pay for the boys and so there was a dinner where we all went out and everyone
data/017182.wav|and i was sitting up at night at
data/023755.wav|i did they uh saved a ton of money by getting
data/003393.wav|about that you guys are taking the
data/016312.wav|mom and pop shop but they're beating even
data/012587.wav|his referral and i'm gonna put a little my own money
data/030219.wav|if you tapped the ground i think you win
data/002199.wav|i i find so few free journalist sources
data/001308.wav|and do whatever it takes so it you know then then you can
data/026537.wav|time like if you jumped in early
data/008316.wav|in a recession we can pretend things are good i believe by the way we are currently though it hasn't hit
data/020480.wav|first time they're not they're not used to this the problem for cyberpunk is not sales damage currently
data/029637.wav|i was a spectator purely um did you know
data/000676.wav|on saturday i walked away only down a little
data/021280.wav|millions of dollars at creators essentially no one else is willing to bleed that much money okay
data/030168.wav|the he said he said all
data/009964.wav|jack novak should filibuster the courts maybe that would work if they get jake novak in they're doing fucking musical jake novak should filibuster the courts maybe that would work if they get jake
data/017471.wav|there was a it was a pretty
data/019008.wav|imagine their appearance and so this is literally like a perfect fake woman that has no facial flaws and i saw
data/001780.wav|it's not appropriate no at the end of the day the lifetime
data/028105.wav|we should but i wanted to give a quick update
data/004714.wav|so royal socks did this and quack help
data/018196.wav|because people being afraid of pronouncing something is enough to deter them from even bringing it up if you're at a car
data/022412.wav|about where he'd be watching it which is youtube don't thank me
data/030588.wav|belgium no shot what's the answer
data/025452.wav|let me give you a fail though
data/030693.wav|for a girl or fifth grade girl maybe comes up
data/011686.wav|my thought is this is this is not necessarily our honeymoon
data/003508.wav|like that so if it's money you can't afford to lose investing now you could see
data/005464.wav|i don't know i don't get it i don't understand it
data/012542.wav|and it would just go static
data/018722.wav|i can't do that dude so if you
data/025369.wav|was it like scared because at
data/017588.wav|lose your money when you buy the car you buy the car it's
data/018301.wav|you got here first yes but my dad he sent me this book
data/029988.wav|why are you shirtless that's a better question but are you
data/024679.wav|so what is particularly interesting is that so much of crypto is owned and
data/008633.wav|just papered over them with new cash and twitter is like kind of
data/024669.wav|why you may have noticed today that everything was down crypto was down stocks were down real estate was down everything was down lost three billion
data/030268.wav|what shampoo did you use and i was like it had it was the the
data/020360.wav|really need to review it's just one of the longest running holiday ads ever it gets the point across so succinctly and they combo this with the special wrapping of the the packaging usually candy spikes around halloween hershey's kisses spike around holidays
data/019158.wav|on just what they're selling even if this ad inspired me it would not inspire me to go sit in my basement and play
data/027917.wav|and i think it's what everyone's been asking
data/014987.wav|i have to say who any of these guys could be a winner
data/015245.wav|game of thrones yeah the the terrible
data/006197.wav|at the beginning but his mom didn't sound
data/020545.wav|beginning to die down the overall takeaway narrative is like the game was buggy and even if it gets fixed and they add
data/007244.wav|yeah i said don't worry about
data/019735.wav|at today aimed squarely at mark zuckerberg okay someone had to say it and thank god we got slim shady to do it
data/010381.wav|really bad at this game actually
data/025214.wav|sometimes you'll make a big terrible mistake and you have to finally learn to put
data/021728.wav|if i could just go home and discuss things with my wife
data/012993.wav|you just you do a lot of it you get obsessed with
data/003325.wav|more likely to get a wage increase that was higher than if they stuck around
data/005265.wav|the second his friends don't know who i am he tries to backtrack like he's already said yo
data/014061.wav|the average engineer is like a copy paste you know someone doesn't really know
data/012550.wav|among us dude you actually could play among us in that ship
data/002060.wav|in popular thing i guess interesting no i'm
data/022559.wav|to users to remind them to practice practice
data/026832.wav|it's how early you bought it seven million
data/014184.wav|something with twitch so there's things that they
data/030428.wav|figure it out like a kgb spot yeah
data/022507.wav|it furthers my brand perception of burger king as having gross food
data/000115.wav|well there'll be sushi at your wedding i am vegan and that is the only fancy food i eat well there wasn't
data/017311.wav|is over half of those employees were added
data/020909.wav|now does that mean you should pick a
data/031457.wav|there's literally that when we walk back
data/009056.wav|kind of spooky time do be flying is my deep thoughts on that hey listen when i go put that in my in my book of quotes time
data/031156.wav|it must be really killing him and it's like bro the people that were saying that uh type people that stay up
data/024467.wav|now the whole concept is they have a regular subway ad that runs before this
data/002454.wav|jeff's the person we're trying to target and in practice they're often a little
data/022800.wav|world where this is not number one i'm shocked but there is a worse one spending two billion dollars for the right to lose 50 billion
data/006974.wav|to qualify for a payment plan that's so funny that is
data/026744.wav|so i think monopolies are as american as apple pie yeah i think this will go through
data/015884.wav|it doesn't really it doesn't um
data/032321.wav|one who believes this lie likely has not attempted the more difficult radiant encounters in hog
data/000306.wav|just happens so sad again every trip to vegas i've ever had where i do a lot of gambling i have the
data/019987.wav|of their ip a lot of their most famous heroes were already licensed
data/022105.wav|in sort of from this one everything you've ever done the internet will find there are no secrets
data/010871.wav|it would be cool to make a new account
data/007333.wav|to get his ass beat it's over and
data/029256.wav|the team menu on that day many pokemon ended up getting
data/020375.wav|i don't like him i don't trust him i don't want what he's buying i don't
data/006720.wav|the i'm never gonna find this
data/001425.wav|it's simple trivia question for the chance at some money hello hello hello
data/028498.wav|but he gets out of there and then my
data/023456.wav|i don't have any room so your goal as a marketer is to raise
data/015143.wav|almost everybody on earth and so netflix is really attempting to test that theory by spending way way way way way more money than they have for the past 10 years netflix has
data/025398.wav|it's actually so sick okay not all of them
data/012843.wav|is the lowest point my whole life i
data/010418.wav|lily's garden game theory that is such a random string of words that you put together it's obviously david thank you
data/004478.wav|and the problem you think me getting double
data/018360.wav|what i gotta find someone new i got i
data/032143.wav|that's a bad sign that's a bad sign
data/016854.wav|i mean listen if you're looking for a job
data/001906.wav|i have six thousand paying subs on
data/026111.wav|the fired strikers they were flooded with fake job applications by
data/009136.wav|all the comments in the last video
data/002924.wav|and i watched it and i had my phone and
data/018683.wav|let's just put a picture of ninja in here this will help you guys understand what's going on they paid a lot of money to buy mixer and they paid even more money to get ninja and before the next console's even out
data/029132.wav|downers dude people would jump in
data/019993.wav|amount of like relevancy and a worldwide box office gross of
data/030661.wav|but can't find a winner finally like
data/021668.wav|gotta love mountain dew they're trying to enter this contest so it's a clean aesthetic it shows the new flavor it's got john
data/020709.wav|in the food i am disgusted so i mean
data/005799.wav|what else happened oh yeah and then we talked a little bit
data/014594.wav|we're going to be good they just want to grow uh
data/015674.wav|whether the safe bet they're probably not
data/020287.wav|okay snowman a symbol come live your dream this holiday season during the year of a million dreams at the place where dreams come true
data/002203.wav|pay for like a lot of different
data/027344.wav|second try because he's actually a soul's
data/014735.wav|it is literally like it's like he's acting out 50 different
data/005287.wav|while working all the time so i
data/022547.wav|i just want you to know that i haven't seen uh i haven't seen
data/012524.wav|that's just my opinion that being said for me
data/003077.wav|when a good mood but in the past couple
data/021493.wav|in one month or one week or what the contracts have
data/014272.wav|things are heating up again and i think so i put this in question marks for
data/021199.wav|okay i am predicting i'm manifesting
data/023409.wav|if the things they make the money back if you just showed up at costco for the
data/017136.wav|we actually just jump in here pretty soon i think in
data/000539.wav|and we all open them and we all have one of the four seasons and it was like a
data/010043.wav|do you understand what i'm talking about
data/000698.wav|the or telling stories and that and
data/016704.wav|and then others very long commutes and ways to alleviate or get around this are going to be extremely important people who come up
data/019609.wav|for a marketing campaign what gets bumped to make room for i'm loving it which we all agree is
data/019339.wav|instead of the travel market we were traveler only company and we made fat margins because we had almost all the traveler market
data/010093.wav|i mean like eight and i chugged seven of them
data/014838.wav|if they're they're making it very
data/002905.wav|it is a two to three dollar per month
data/004189.wav|i don't know if you guys are just busy that day or what but it really it kind of felt weird i was hoping you would rsvp so that i could
data/021864.wav|or metrics and numbers you you become very fixed on what you know works already okay you get very much locked in
data/000507.wav|wait a minute still a good omen actually forget that i have to find
data/022603.wav|don't even have to be in a pool to experience it
data/023204.wav|it's very interesting because fruit juices are generally delicious
data/028527.wav|the work workday i get home i see this letter
data/012534.wav|it was expensive and i still
data/014975.wav|big hollywood studio holding out everyone
data/025546.wav|i just in general as a person i'm deeply
data/021212.wav|these dots represent shows okay and these four boxes represent how much
data/002252.wav|monday to their dad continues to
data/001967.wav|it's to make waffles you know i i think i could have fun doing anything you're it's kind of a
data/017188.wav|i'm sorry i could breathe i couldn't get a deep breath my nose was completely blocked and every time i tried to do a full
data/013242.wav|let me know that there's going to be a mario striker's brawl masters invitational
data/013824.wav|mario's better than jack and daxter you know i would
data/018082.wav|i am trying so hard right now i am a sweat i am a
data/012966.wav|you gotta try to be good at it
data/010408.wav|still better than spectrum yeah i mean even even having
data/009871.wav|you know germany to paris in no time like
data/018713.wav|well way to get into gamers homes
data/012660.wav|i feel like i've been out for a week plus with the wedding into the
data/026449.wav|in general emote cultural moments i don't
data/032021.wav|player it looks like the kind of
data/032346.wav|but suddenly was able to clear presumably all of it in a moderately more than a few hours at most there's a lot more
data/031215.wav|and i uh i remember i had a pretty funny
data/002882.wav|we could very well be in a situation where elon musk needs to start tweeting positive things about twitter things that imply that he will go through with the deal so this number goes back up closer
data/000239.wav|we're like yeah but if we roll bad it's just my brother going
data/000376.wav|so i get down i get down
data/032318.wav|he watched obsessively on his final stream when he completed
data/014421.wav|and seeing who emerges victorious and
data/031913.wav|well where everyone's sitting like in a row
data/018488.wav|after all let me try to give you guys a sense of
data/019164.wav|that would be kind of interesting or like if it showed for example I mean you
data/010444.wav|if the eight months eric's he's
data/021031.wav|i i i have a vibe i think we both have a
data/029083.wav|and the answer is i was going to everyone who was an early
data/007261.wav|well he said some really nice things and okay right after the tournament's over like
data/015463.wav|disney's like this big gigantic titanic ship and it's hard to turn it's very hard
data/019414.wav|maybe need some work and for that reason i have created something quite special a marketing monday jingle tier list okay wait i
data/025656.wav|seeing crypto scams punish crypto bros live is like my favorite
data/023133.wav|they launched a book called cooking with sky prawns that had 20 recipes and tried to drive
data/029820.wav|what the final cut on the documentary yeah yeah
data/030722.wav|was that let's just look up quack score
data/020829.wav|it couldn't be done people said
data/028454.wav|with the office and i'm just sitting there on the floor
data/021030.wav|what's up in her opinion because of the dog and also it's like um it's not
data/020050.wav|by december by the end of the year
data/028283.wav|stop and go to a little bit of
data/017743.wav|bad experience tesla dealerships are better
data/030919.wav|i think you've been really been a little rude lately okay
data/000604.wav|that show that was awesome i
data/013717.wav|somebody says slurs in chat somebody
data/029163.wav|i could get like past erica but
data/022061.wav|are still logged into the brand account and thinking they're on their personal account
data/006123.wav|do this like it was planned but then this ev this this
data/009498.wav|we're coming up clutch there mr
data/014140.wav|twitch started to get real tight with the purse strings once they
data/020934.wav|it did a little bit better and made a bunch of money because no one's going into it less competitive so going for opportunity first things that jump out to you and making a little bit of money and some connections and getting established helps when you want
data/023211.wav|if the juice is xrc's stream
data/008884.wav|what found out that he tried to buy the whole company because you know
data/032289.wav|i walked away with nothing i learned something about vegas and that's that if you want to
data/032301.wav|i love that too it's just the nature of i think creating stuff or the nature of the human condition
data/015255.wav|a bill it's like electricity it's like it's like water electricity
data/009062.wav|what's up what's up what's up what's up sorry wait one second one second i forgot to
data/005519.wav|it was all just dumb family jokes but the problem is i'm just not drunk and everyone was drunk and
data/009027.wav|can i can i see more here's a clip
data/013379.wav|where's my camera we got james
data/028390.wav|it sounds so dumb yeah on purpose that's why it's great and and the you saying that makes me
data/020100.wav|usually you're acquiring them for the product but sometimes if they have talent you really want the people you really want like really talented engineers or product people it's called and aqua higher or basically you're hiring that you're buying the company just to usually you're acquiring them for the product but sometimes if they have talent you really want the people you really want like really talented engineers or product people it's called an aqua hire where basically you're hiring
data/029368.wav|winning these guys over i think i've been quite you know i
data/020785.wav|our life the other nike ad from this campaign the comeback kid
data/012123.wav|wearing something so you'll see some part of the story so
data/018621.wav|so they started paying billions of dollars netflix
data/020548.wav|if the things quickly after years of crunch and i'm i'm not sure they can execute it it's
data/016585.wav|what they do is now uh
data/004321.wav|see disappointing because it's not steve
data/002622.wav|i really i thought i thought the content
data/015024.wav|this is a picture of a commercial i
data/017580.wav|of itself but that model has changed the world of marketing has changed
data/022415.wav|is zero percent retract i think
data/019074.wav|has emotions you're not like oh my god you're acting okay you don't really have those emotions you're an actor playing a
data/028007.wav|the future of the market so like i said way back in my first video on this console war as long as the competition remains fierce between
data/013788.wav|and yes there is okay this is a big win for science okay i think gamers in chat can relate have
data/024982.wav|wish bag you do not fit in
data/013613.wav|it happened four hours ago but
data/000984.wav|five months kitten warlock think of
data/026308.wav|unveiled their very first apple store and they did it completely differently from established schools of thought they created an extremely expensive luxury temple to the brand if you
data/011454.wav|hey are you a big simple plan finn they're my favorite band i'll be honest with you no no i'm not i've listen i have people can enjoy their own fucking music i i don't hey are you a big simple plan fan they're my favorite band i'll be honest with you no
data/015415.wav|by disney plus and gets all that for free for one fee they're making way less money off you
data/003380.wav|a move during the robot's turn and that
data/026510.wav|and they chose all in on hate
data/017342.wav|is on right now technically but i also was employed by amazon as
data/031947.wav|no but it was like another it was probably another
data/030065.wav|i got a fake pokemon red or a broken pokemon red from a trade on a bus that had a broken battery and i would come from school and play
data/011813.wav|what are they not break character they are actively in character the entire time they yeah
data/010359.wav|you know i might get sussy with it and
data/025288.wav|among us was bigger than squid game okay
data/027995.wav|well that's what i'm saying how buggy does the game have to be if bethesda delayed it because they think it's too buggy
data/007312.wav|one of them was a kid and they were like pooling their money
data/024252.wav|for the price tag of 5 million plus
data/007192.wav|intel tell when i saw jmuk's
data/018501.wav|on this chart it's near like
data/000665.wav|the laughing at him like stop stop stop giving and then
data/030098.wav|two straight up it's there and if you guys don't know the the
data/012740.wav|war stuff but real life is not like that
data/014004.wav|if they can take me ludwig's got some youtube money
data/017102.wav|what i'm saying how did tommy in it
data/010681.wav|there isn't a boss wait is that is that going to be a thing am i going to go to play a
data/019261.wav|and I certainly didn't remember them
data/025487.wav|which speculation this guy went on and tried to pump
data/003849.wav|with the people that are entirely different in
data/007295.wav|the moment j mook appeared on
data/014618.wav|it's been growing so there's probably groups of
data/028407.wav|well as project and if the person who owns that project
data/011113.wav|that doesn't make a lot of sense right but i
data/028268.wav|it was like please hire so
data/010416.wav|i see that you guys are complaining but i looked this up recently actually as recently as yesterday and internet speeds in canada are on average much faster and much cheaper so
data/015191.wav|have spider-man you'd have star wars et
data/008807.wav|that billion dollar back out fee is like if an act of god comes in and this deal cannot go through for whatever reason i mean whatever crazy reason
data/027154.wav|the hot potatoes landed here and they can either raise interest rates collapse the
data/021334.wav|people are getting more anxious and they are getting more sad these are real facts that we need to confront and address
data/031321.wav|water bottle i just didn't get it finally two cops get there and then they
data/016147.wav|don't change your life based on that that
data/009639.wav|it losing prospects great back on the package what is stands in the situation is
data/016287.wav|is out here like you know what we don't care crunch
data/024507.wav|so when you logged on to buy v bucks you
data/024035.wav|and extreme and it was a huge bonus for their competitors and so they realized holy
data/030255.wav|at shower but i go into a shower
data/004635.wav|he calls in and he's like
data/031519.wav|you have what's called an ace match and that's where you can send out anyone
data/000247.wav|it down i turn around it is five more of my closest friends from high school that
data/016499.wav|a good trend helps and jeff bezos
data/028370.wav|it's also a company to say the word net
data/025950.wav|and so when you add all that up all that innovation on riot's side
data/031117.wav|and me having done it when i was seven was such an advantage that i took a break in the middle got uber eats stopped
data/018174.wav|we are going to look at different auto manufacturers and how they've approached marketing and we're going to find out who is crushing who is being crushed and what that means to my audience boom before you guys judge some of these ads here's the deal the average age of car buyers by brand this is one thing you need to know going
data/014083.wav|job mixer in this tweet thereby saving twitch forever ninja would have destroyed twitch
data/018909.wav|who could know what they want who's
data/015676.wav|three companies is missing something they need to make some changes
data/011808.wav|with the screen so i'm looking out and it's like they're stars whooshing by and
data/022497.wav|we really roasted on previous marketing monday and that of course is burger king we really laid into burger king about
data/031496.wav|harder to master than chess yes yes i
data/032005.wav|if like no you can't have that there's there's way too much sugar and he's like in front of all his boys and he's like i can order
data/020276.wav|if the product which is usually a huge no-no but i think it actually makes the ad because you get the joke so quickly
data/001378.wav|hello hello hello hi you've been called
data/018110.wav|it took a tour of america this is how japan sees america dude the
data/002222.wav|that's a classic ben sw if you guys
data/005422.wav|in absence of every other part of their childhood and it has really deeply
data/004261.wav|you can withdraw it because right until now fortnite
data/026357.wav|one of the things that apple does differently in the
data/025173.wav|i've had some companies like mcdonald's reach out to me and ask for a new logo
data/018392.wav|it's every industry they will tell you they can't afford to pay you more they almost always can they almost always can they just don't want to they want the
data/019259.wav|interested in gimmicks bill today we have the
data/031320.wav|if someone had told me what was going on right away maybe i could have salvaged it maybe but nobody even told me and i mean i'm like
data/004363.wav|northern lion as usual very funny guy
data/009727.wav|with the language you should find the right word
data/020113.wav|in conclusion the number one acquisition of all time apple acquires next getting steve jobs and a better ios and that my friends i believe well argued well accurate are the
data/024470.wav|and then you think the second ad slot is like a perfume ad but at the end they say
data/031624.wav|i don't know what i was
data/015919.wav|i of their lives netflix can still raise prices
data/020065.wav|actually the biggest ones are companies that are
data/031175.wav|because of where twitch prime was at
data/027821.wav|the gamestop and you're buying amc and i'm trying to get the the chart
data/015009.wav|it's like the setting the stage okay tv usage is in
data/006470.wav|i can give it away that can sort of uh
data/005246.wav|walk to her friends were chilling and
data/019699.wav|it was awesome please following peter scott
data/001272.wav|this is a long okay let's get to work
data/018594.wav|it's released and that one might be the most likely
data/007625.wav|but i think people should give him credit
data/019024.wav|to get logan paul to say some nice stuff about your brand and the next day he decides i'm
data/027576.wav|i take over twitter there has been a lot of people a
data/030414.wav|what the trip everything's going good but i can't find a
data/006592.wav|media posts that he doesn't understand come on one more time bring it back it'll work for sure scout's honor
data/003822.wav|i think it's i think it's not unrealistic and i think it could happen quicker than people think it's happened
data/020359.wav|very simple ver we don't even really
data/016338.wav|supernatural and just gets rid of its
data/017373.wav|what marvel okay because new data has shown that over
data/005230.wav|and it feels like you know when i get
data/018446.wav|computer or monitor or phone you'd already be locked in you don't want to leave your library behind valve is just slow the real problem with valve and steam is
data/001210.wav|and you're like out of high
data/016160.wav|i was working today i got i got no idea
data/016922.wav|that's great universities are worth it now
data/010354.wav|are you went to school with lyric
data/032349.wav|install the ghost mod it took me an hour on
data/011328.wav|i mean if you need let's say we are you
data/028003.wav|if the the game this year it's making 2022 seem a
data/005439.wav|i didn't turn anyone down and one common theme seemed to emerge from all the ones that i saw submitted to the
data/015951.wav|what if you watch it a bunch every day and you
data/022186.wav|this is ahri's submission for sad ads so
data/015758.wav|the biggest right now but it's also the um
data/018431.wav|maybe a little bit higher than luna
data/026465.wav|with the quick quick and easy one but i wanted to
data/002089.wav|hello are you excited for the new hearthstone expansion no gross
data/010567.wav|what's going on god damn i hate spectrum so much but i
data/022082.wav|i guess we'll never know i mean it's not a great tweet but the idea
data/026112.wav|and the internet which severely hampered their ability to hire scabs there was a it was a pretty
data/024593.wav|well of appearing in court without wearing a tuxedo as he originally was required to do in the opening days of the trial thank god for the justice system thank god so you know what maybe fortnite
data/000801.wav|what i'm thinking like oh it's
data/021380.wav|i give them back to cutie she
data/019212.wav|it's about to change the game I'm
data/003746.wav|a break the law and if i get caught i'm
data/024751.wav|the separate you from your money so i chose one game in particular to kind of follow the story through this applies to a lot of games but i
data/019870.wav|in any way has been a flop over hyped flop every single one has failed wow launched in
data/023038.wav|what usually happens in these cases what usually happens is a company stands up for
data/002433.wav|straight up george r martin using
data/005607.wav|school and if you guys don't know what
data/026614.wav|billion dollars absurd amount of money in the gaming space it is by far the largest acquisition in gaming history in fact i have created a little chart to explain it to you these are the
data/017863.wav|good communication this kind of stuff this published area
data/013528.wav|two rounds i have never seen this happen in a boyfriend girlfriend relationship in fact when i first met ari i really liked um that she i
data/019552.wav|autozone jingle and he went absolutely
data/002156.wav|you want a real theory fall guys okay just think about it big
data/021556.wav|i would be careful because the next one you hear about on wall street is going
data/029354.wav|if the for team liquid i was doing these odd job work for like
data/027908.wav|if you don't get more oceanfront than that you get the ocean right at your door again
data/025067.wav|the height of a famine sweeping ethiopia they tried to force ethiopia pay them a 6 million dollar debt
data/012904.wav|nvidia and every single person in my life told
data/017106.wav|the college and it is 20k
data/018934.wav|because that's not the only reason this thing failed these guys clearly lacked foresight they clearly lacked any
data/015382.wav|they've had more hits for what they spent now is that enough
data/006871.wav|what hearthstone packs and expensed them to
data/011513.wav|well likes the irs the irs
data/015313.wav|if they don't really care about the content unlike netflix which is a content play
data/016738.wav|oh you know a huge amount of our methane emissions come from cows
data/026059.wav|let's give a win to somebody who really
data/016279.wav|in space cd projekt red who promised from their game director on the
data/002572.wav|you what tell you what tell you
data/021173.wav|i will not get all of these right but
data/021321.wav|to realize their value begin to start their own businesses imagine if
data/017520.wav|sort of a way of viewing it to think about
data/026416.wav|worse it is a proven phenomenon where car companies will run ads not even to attract new buyers but to make buyers that spend money on their car feel
data/005956.wav|is the biggest pop offer in the world so the idea that and by the way you can probably see it right here look at
data/013308.wav|wall street magician and i give him five
data/020334.wav|i am performance this is perfect for my chat because they all drive mercedes benzes a
data/022354.wav|that i would feel cool about wearing
data/016016.wav|don't have to worry about is that um
data/031289.wav|so you're probably thinking well then wait how did you get arrested that's because
data/021358.wav|it's us versus them there's a war being waged against the
data/016326.wav|with the rest of the world
data/024084.wav|it looks pretty self-explanatory i don't
data/023708.wav|it's weird to add the the recruiter cards like this is
data/023662.wav|half my earnings as far as taxes and i got back nothing so they've
data/002103.wav|but i draft so it's fun
data/022599.wav|we're really excited about playstation flow it's potential to break through traditional gaming barriers is immense
data/018356.wav|the second twitch offers you any amount of money including
data/013063.wav|it was awesome i learned so much
data/020072.wav|waiter billion dollars probably greater because instagram is essentially the most dominant and influential social platform currently if you want to advertise online you have two options you go to google or you go to facebook you advertise on
data/031024.wav|no i haven't heard of that
data/000168.wav|i want to go to the bathroom because i mean i
data/004108.wav|as an nvidia intern and you know it's fun little things and it was nice and all the comments were like
data/026800.wav|make like 70 billion dollar buyouts
data/026255.wav|and oh yeah you still have like 60 billion
data/024728.wav|it's the top no no no no no no
data/018599.wav|right now the first wave of
data/027803.wav|by printing a bunch of money surprise surprise it actually worked but it's like you're feeling depressed so you take
data/028923.wav|it was like one shoulder on her arm one shoulder on his but like
data/002085.wav|and then you get thrown out of the church where you're getting married
data/021484.wav|when they made these short contracts it was like under 20 which means
data/020735.wav|of the year there are so many bad marketers out there who spend all year making terrible ads hoping to one day win the monday
data/011091.wav|it's x king that's what it was sphynx
data/003964.wav|what our policies are and figure out how we're
data/000667.wav|and so lottery would come up and be like
data/028624.wav|i played mid so i immediately queue up
data/003611.wav|about that the number of people living with their parents
data/009823.wav|finally europe's way ahead of us on buying electric cars
data/004381.wav|everyone every single person here myself included isn't aware that you just cut
data/022237.wav|if the story of just the parents
data/003107.wav|it feels like it either heavily discounts the many negative stories i've heard about working at amazon the fact that i quit working from amazon
data/024511.wav|that kicked off the entire lawsuit where epic games claimed they had a monopoly they
data/025635.wav|okay it doesn't happen very often every once in a while in human history there will be a breakthrough so powerful and so dynamic that we think about life before and after you know what i'm saying well this week it was the solving of world hunger world hunger is no longer a problem after a man who goes by the name dylan figured out that you could get a six flags magic mountain annual pass for
data/013244.wav|it's got a certain level of
data/026441.wav|an impact on the sales he sells more subs than most people if you want to get more
data/005773.wav|i'm gonna tell you this this is
data/019569.wav|to have like a bad idea everyone wants to feel like they're contributing so if you show an executive an idea and it's perfect they don't want to
data/007183.wav|i'm a grinder i know i never like
data/010239.wav|full art posters of my father and
data/002484.wav|hello games that brands play but they do play a lot of them

data/025081.wav|it is more like an nps type score ea
data/006272.wav|but i must have missed his reaction
data/000280.wav|or like a teacher and you know
data/006517.wav|and they start throwing a ton of fees and
data/003633.wav|we are in a period where
data/026013.wav|and publish it it's all available okay it's all available and it's all kosher because winnie the pooh is now public domain that being said it's actually not all available i'm sorry to call that a

data/029160.wav|i would i would like sieve through the
data/012631.wav|so we don't have it on video but like at one point they go you know do
data/012250.wav|at the corner and there would be like people
data/004960.wav|so yeah this is pretty much all laid out in my first video but
data/020407.wav|i like sneak off to the back so the way i think
data/031257.wav|i bridge had a stairway so i walk up that access
data/016411.wav|the french guy that noticed that when gold
data/029749.wav|what i'm hearing that's how you get it i guess so i

data/027278.wav|ensure that it was their main thing and they've
data/007575.wav|just got to really kick it with them
data/009221.wav|well it's i'm not gonna read your message because
data/006590.wav|just a few thousand theaters that's all we need we'll definitely go this time we
data/024436.wav|this one's like the most basic one right
data/010962.wav|by entering the minions pizza challenge act fast
data/013442.wav|actually rey and it is because of
data/032062.wav|there's no duplicate jokes or whatever right just in case
data/013475.wav|in there for guys it's like always like a picture
data/008783.wav|but it's only like 30 billion of his
data/017224.wav|i think someone said something about
data/031173.wav|that's going to be a hard ass record to beat what's crazier about
data/028521.wav|get on a payment plan or you're gonna
data/021769.wav|just tell them it was you
data/026937.wav|it's a real problem right now and it's hitting the exact like literally perfect on the demo of who
data/006319.wav|i love this elden ring takes video
data/012347.wav|some of the drinks were not some of the like fancier drinks were not inclusive but i believe everything
data/005713.wav|like a public mall we're like on
data/005881.wav|it'd be careful right because i don't want
data/012373.wav|if you like he's not into it at all
data/021888.wav|looks pretty good tall starts a talent agency makes it one of the biggest in hollywood gets he's worth hundreds of millions of dollars and then jeff bezos comes along and
data/011547.wav|as your representation for the world and that has never had a good take not one and i've been on the internet a long time i haven't seen one sesame street is just one piece for kids
data/008725.wav|like if it it basically has to imply that all the
data/008392.wav|it is this on what i wanted to say today's twitter lawsuit is filled
data/013288.wav|that i'll tell you about in a second
data/014590.wav|is huge because they count uh
data/027083.wav|most of the countries that you guys live in now okay here's the thing here's the
data/016966.wav|so thank you for watching marketing money
data/019952.wav|the only thing that made this a viable competitor to sony and nintendo out of the gate was that they had an absolute killer app in halo so that's why it's my
data/014099.wav|this time it's personal i don't want to leak
data/031201.wav|erase race versus insanely old boomer
data/008378.wav|i had to call a bunch of
data/029490.wav|like because then you're like okay well
data/027854.wav|well coins quote unquote don't actually have the monetary reserves to
data/008168.wav|can you even watch the boys on stream you absolutely can thank god for amazon prime watch parties this week is indeed for the gamers
data/008956.wav|it's to do a 45 billion
data/013808.wav|i said unequivocally because there was a lot of uh fear
data/016770.wav|i was immigration ever and uh and we're having
data/005369.wav|and so i assume that's it i'm like okay so
data/016383.wav|it is just it's just it's just hundreds
data/007554.wav|and he's like you that's how
data/014356.wav|but they haven't done it well but if someone comes along there's the
data/028135.wav|oh they said they'd be in fact things are much more dire they were valued at
data/023949.wav|what is shifting earlier and it's basically how some zoomers are so sad about our
data/032219.wav|wait wait wait wait wait wait
data/007562.wav|i like tournament if you google phantom
data/032187.wav|this is gonna be a 12. and then yes
data/020851.wav|on twitter time for a stiff drink and some truth you probably don't want to hear which starts off a little bit
data/011181.wav|the spot i can't imagine consistently
data/000963.wav|from china he was like yeah we don't have bachelor i told
data/002360.wav|i have to the front foot puts you right up there at the front
data/011151.wav|it does it gets the job done
data/016591.wav|it's the corporations who can install it on their
data/009018.wav|i can't i can't with these guys
data/030913.wav|ah that joke was not meant for
data/003651.wav|means it's very very hard to stop these
data/015523.wav|this show which is basically set in a small set with a couple actors talking cost as much the amount of money they spend on reese witherspoon
data/016173.wav|keep doing it um too hard on my
data/019090.wav|you know what all subs today all
data/029376.wav|he's got a lot there's people that
data/002872.wav|and he has to pay a big fine his next step from
data/005825.wav|what's it like that like he's got a bunch of stuff like it wasn't i
data/020540.wav|while multiplayer in some way it's the way to sustain but but because of the bugs because of the launch because of the
data/013523.wav|read below that is boring this is amazing
data/024196.wav|his money okay twitch loses more money than it makes and so
data/031142.wav|someone i know as a friend i like ludwig
data/001248.wav|i'm pleased to share we will be working together to create they respond to the post i mean it's
data/010156.wav|no i know he's he's on board with it he just wants to
data/002928.wav|are staying power or makes people
data/001178.wav|carbs pure pure taste that you could get i'm sure
data/016388.wav|of it from the ppp loans um
data/012009.wav|obviously with the kids they're a little
data/031964.wav|in the back of the row
data/032341.wav|you're telling me this is also like just so good for my ego you're telling me he somehow
data/009903.wav|also meeting and your property value won't go
data/010777.wav|i'm arriving let's go let's go let's go let's go let's go let's go let's go let's go let's go
data/026047.wav|but the beginning wave is what's fine the problem is once they get all these employees they they wield a lot of political power because they have
data/001471.wav|but i probably would have taken merkel
data/013846.wav|isn't holding them hostage replacing players
data/012293.wav|suffice to say i fold i fall i
data/019525.wav|clearly this is touching a personal
data/025465.wav|i was this how is this opportunity so good and again everyone
data/030096.wav|if i don't get how you pikachu tonight
data/014823.wav|there's there's articles about it and then they say this is just the beginning and then let's get one more article here this one right here should be perfect uh
data/030773.wav|the god and god is forcing my hand
data/025392.wav|making fun of it again but then i thought about it again on a third level
data/009367.wav|is that my understanding he's doing a lot of
data/017547.wav|one disney and oh yeah you still have like 60 billion dollars
data/023552.wav|do this they would lower the price drive competitors out of business and
data/024901.wav|what is under time pressure next thing is the ikea effect okay the ikea effect states we love things more if we felt like we were part of the creation if we felt involved in making them we think it's worth a lot more than it is so even a shitty table from ikea generally has
data/012805.wav|mister global and i was trying to get known on streams and stuff but it wasn't really popping off
data/031102.wav|and so what i told stands i remember
data/009378.wav|was on a champion he's never played before
data/020766.wav|i bet you know it's lit it's so lit
data/015464.wav|much money from the way things currently are that they have to cannibalize themselves to grow disney plus if they were to say like we're releasing frozen two and it's exclusive
data/032172.wav|i say let it ride i don't give
data/015473.wav|if the on disney required you to spend an extra
data/001285.wav|single audience for a person yeah that's that's odd so you're saying you
data/020263.wav|that like okay oh okay let's tell a deep story oh we
data/018006.wav|a huge overlap oh no oh did i play a sack song over a serious
data/031073.wav|and i could tell he didn't have the money now knowing ludwig now i would revel in the chance to bankrupt him but at the time i was like just
data/008600.wav|with the day before his tweet and they showed this in the
data/023397.wav|do you think ford will ever collab with epic games to make
data/003777.wav|he's just openly taking coal money
data/004951.wav|nobody else wants to pick him up now
data/003062.wav|back when we had them go first and stance put his hand on my back you know
data/008605.wav|he tweeted right here if our twitter bid succeeds we will
data/027252.wav|the real money in their store to get the
data/013482.wav|i'm not i'm not this bad but i'm not saying i haven't done something similar once or twice not crying obviously obviously not crying that would be
data/017366.wav|does happen that's insane that is insane
data/014624.wav|but i don't want to call it a superpower of
data/026867.wav|back to the product but it was still
data/023321.wav|and that's that's all i can tell you
data/029697.wav|isn't there he was just kind of drunk or whatever like not he was you know he was just
data/014603.wav|dope streaming platform if you want to get if you have a good internet speed but but
data/028841.wav|a little cot you could sleep on
data/012867.wav|your year it was like it was failing you know what i'm saying i
data/024775.wav|if themselves as spenders once they've broken the ice once you break
data/016003.wav|what's stopping them is that no
data/020967.wav|it'll probably find even more entertaining the reason today's marketing monday is this i was reading as i do ad week at age
data/024770.wav|we reduced let's say you're like oh i
data/019702.wav|well here is that he seems like he's way way way way way too nice and i'm so toxic and my community two things i i picked up from that
data/027070.wav|i thought the whole joke was that it would just be the sloth and then he would eat the chip and it would be like so spicy that like he would go from
data/006582.wav|but what i thought was really funny uh was
data/004215.wav|at this point it's like at this point a big gaming company banning
data/006003.wav|of your sets i thought you were like the rank seven fox in australia or something
data/024337.wav|way the leading man sometimes a change of name is more than a change of name sometimes it's a chance to show the world
data/015330.wav|on the wheel of time do you guys know
data/026312.wav|if the things they've done but the key thing that's
data/024343.wav|it's union yeah it probably is a better name because you kind of
data/025734.wav|yes that's technically true but i think this is probably more
data/021208.wav|i went anywhere everyone is buying netflix and they're not leaving it is it's like a cable bill
data/020109.wav|it's of that he started alright because
data/006142.wav|now lyric by the way still gracious
data/030516.wav|it's point she's like cringing for me you know she's like
data/018290.wav|work here yet then why do you keep coming back when i was in the service my dad
data/013034.wav|i'm playing ori this week for sure
data/009363.wav|i mentioned it offhandedly once and
data/024038.wav|i could get the deals and then kind of look the other way and not really enforce basically any
data/004041.wav|yeah that was very very very annoying i'm glad i did not do it live because i
data/004145.wav|they don't want to pay me okay so big upgrade is that paid the musician is
data/027599.wav|and probably drafted up some bangers in the past year
data/023221.wav|you're right now okay this is my food pyramid let's get a box of these at the top and then let's get a chipotle steak burrito
data/027409.wav|a free tax reporting software that would just tell you how much you owe and you could add any deductions you
data/011141.wav|well i would never make fun of you
data/022582.wav|innovative ideas and technology here at the wearables division we're working on ways of bringing the playstation experience to all areas of your life building on the recent success of remote play and chair play and not to mention project morpheus we're about to take
data/007233.wav|we thought enron was like a meme he thought it was like
data/015400.wav|access stay competitive is they have same day
data/021585.wav|for cheaper and they went to go buy it back
data/016756.wav|and so people that have solutions and
data/031868.wav|it's a different kind of purple i guess it's kind of what is what is the
data/014450.wav|as a better system twitch needs
data/007373.wav|this is the first melee tournament i watched and it was pretty i it was great
data/031170.wav|the number one thing from the beginning was the record and i and
data/003288.wav|actual win okay let me get you a goddamn
data/029555.wav|at the community but we were so full of hope i know i mean everyone
data/012175.wav|you the first order business all day i need a
data/001685.wav|know about this everybody knows that grandpa
data/004175.wav|get a sense of the vibe figure it out
data/008263.wav|it's very very cool and he'll
data/009986.wav|the live on a saturday night so
data/013594.wav|of your make and model and
data/021609.wav|i have analyzed and determined a special rating algorithm to determine which
data/015875.wav|that's the problem but also people don't want to spend that much money on cable the reason they liked streaming services because they could spend way less to get a bunch of stuff so now people
data/012377.wav|kind of cool to be like going to a bar and like trying to get a secret code from
data/014471.wav|a lot of people that he talked to told him to pick one of the
data/024476.wav|you've completely it has left no memorable
data/018386.wav|actually just they act like they don't
data/024051.wav|search interest for only fans to reach an
data/032356.wav|long for whatever reason is pathetic i have
data/007303.wav|pride okay just pure pride on that face there's
data/013237.wav|they forgot to talk about the direct
data/030621.wav|cause they have a different power system so the one thing i wanted in this world
data/021833.wav|to some other billionaires out there who maybe aren't as eloquent in their writing capabilities okay maybe they're
data/015597.wav|investment play they're doing well they
data/022160.wav|is in my mind the one that kicked off the trend google's ad dear sophie
data/020610.wav|i mean dare i say phenomenal but actually i'm sorry i i
data/019218.wav|realizing there was a god when I saw this on like
data/026272.wav|three billion verizon 3 billion verizon a
data/013359.wav|well that's just a normal thing
data/017748.wav|or so stuck in this pre-purchase
data/030351.wav|this year because of having been forced to really spend a lot of time together because of code but i just
data/014221.wav|new streamer if you're like a person who's like tomorrow
data/000015.wav|i do not have the look i was like i
data/024451.wav|ooh campaign from subway that is the perfect combination of bad and expensive and desperate that i thought i would show it if you guys don't know a study came out recently that claimed subway tuna is zero
data/031401.wav|it's to really stretched that 3k
data/002405.wav|can't get my head around it cst though that's that's
data/023972.wav|a new free app separate from only fans that is completely free of adult content okay a separate only fans tv app it's
data/003592.wav|are slowing hiring if not freezing and the smaller ones are
data/014644.wav|donna marketing wednesday this feels weird to
data/009783.wav|inflation's up high same as everywhere but you know pretty damn high the
data/003215.wav|infinity for them like they would buy them the pokemon give it to their accounts they would level them up by
data/001723.wav|he's on like it's like set in the
data/031225.wav|so nationals all of the best
data/010369.wav|maybe explain how she got this cat
data/024948.wav|we're thinking this is so sad this is so cringe this will never be me i
data/004909.wav|five billion dollars and once he did that they could not say no
data/028154.wav|the risk of actual actual bankruptcy unless they acquire new funding soon they can't continue to lose millions of dollars a month and not get this merger faze clan while they still have some
data/028200.wav|the tournament twitch steps in and pays for buses and a new uh venue and
data/001814.wav|i was like that it just feels arrogant
data/003780.wav|that that was put forward and and it was good dude it was pretty good
data/014047.wav|and stats and how much this might hurt them in the short term and realizing it wouldn't hurt that much in the short
data/015488.wav|very slow and it's what's keeping them from being as strong as they could be
data/013189.wav|yeah i'm surprised you're telling me now that's dope sounds pretty cold down there though huh weird weird weird
data/010821.wav|that really brings out the worst
data/017455.wav|kellogg's strike in the rain with the hibachi sitting there this person
data/029760.wav|good time especially given how hard
data/017229.wav|golf the new year with some with an ode to eating ass
data/002792.wav|if you go to their music video all the
data/030787.wav|yeah that's actually a subtle take on the current geopolitical climate in iran i'm glad you picked up on that what did you mean by that's an awfully hot coffee pot i was just trying to say the situation in the united states is like that of a coffee pot and it's about to boil over you know
data/004992.wav|extremely bad for elon um those loans
data/003259.wav|will get in early enough for this to
data/028809.wav|imagine if i told you what i was actually making so anyway
data/000981.wav|one replacement that i would get my fiancee
data/020853.wav|i was like okay we don't need a stiff drink for your
data/003783.wav|so they have a game plan
data/012601.wav|it is what i'm saying i'm saying sell your house get your parents
data/029802.wav|when i started working at twitch we started
data/007134.wav|it's like you're no longer required to bear a
data/015148.wav|that money netflix is making all these
data/020302.wav|want a commercial and see what we
data/023418.wav|shame on you absolutely shame on you
data/030615.wav|were represented on the base it was not an all english school
data/031144.wav|of flagrant lie but i assumed he was just like not thinking about it too much but what i will say is that there's
data/024587.wav|and i thought that was a pretty good
data/011605.wav|a bit of uh that streak in me i don't like to
data/026162.wav|is blizzard for reportedly making a secret overwatch mobile game this is what they needed finally genius
data/008789.wav|i don't want to give 17 billion dollars to a guy
data/013919.wav|or buy now pay later by the way if you don't know about
data/014700.wav|bunch of weird stuff in it
data/020959.wav|you know what you were right about this too
data/020207.wav|it's to advertise on facebook it's safer
data/024944.wav|we'll get all of the attention and i think a
data/026501.wav|let me give you one more let's double up look there's
data/030443.wav|day the day of the puzzle valentine's day we're in
data/028863.wav|because a truck america needs a ray tracing
data/015502.wav|why they're valued exactly the same and it'll be
data/012135.wav|yeah so so uh but anyway the only
data/020254.wav|side of the emotional spectrum generally if a good holiday ad is going to take advantage of the fact that during the holidays we're all in our fields a little bit more
data/026586.wav|is it come across better this is my one piece with free advice for all streamers if
data/015396.wav|oh bigger movie i think the matrix is out there right now and you can watch it all same day now other companies either don't have theatrical studios like let's
data/019729.wav|is stupid that's number one number two is gating all of the jobs they want to
data/028970.wav|but maybe that's why they didn't like me but not these buses just to get across town to get to the military base and then i got to the military base and the only thing i had on the military base because the package hadn't arrived yet with my debit card
data/027588.wav|that was from today and you'd think
data/004466.wav|absolutely absolutely yeah no doubt that i will i will not play that
data/003833.wav|step one in my mind okay
data/004174.wav|how about that come in look at the title get
data/021083.wav|you guys know what marketing is do
data/018526.wav|better games microsoft is willing to spend their way out of that hole and
data/007142.wav|like even if it's an innocuous cough i hear every single one you know because like i don't want to
data/014790.wav|am a lot and so i'm
data/001982.wav|and they all had different names the reason that was the case was because froyo is a very
data/009850.wav|the thing about it's so funny because like every building has parking requirements
data/019400.wav|where's the market share of every category anyway we
data/013896.wav|if he was like eating your vegetables first dude i don't
data/019134.wav|is it that was it that was it that was it
data/028654.wav|looks at me weird opens it i
data/007250.wav|i think after this tournament sponsors are gonna
data/001372.wav|territories can i just pull you into
data/028414.wav|on military bases i lived on military bases

data/013059.wav|best teacher i ever had was one that wasn't beholden to a curriculum that checks out yeah it just makes sense

data/008957.wav|for twitter as an excuse i don't i don't think he needs to do a
data/002275.wav|i dropped an album it would do well that would be a good story that would
data/023901.wav|the old or something pound way back in the day and he's now the oldest person to
data/027108.wav|long paused in a while i love
data/005894.wav|i'm the fall guy is what he would like to be referred to as and uh i just we couldn't allow him to
data/006096.wav|let me just tell you hbox pops
data/026561.wav|so we can sell the rights to netflix for some sort of
data/023356.wav|we love it it's great and what that means is we will do it right up until we don't need to microsoft is offering one of the best value deals of all time with um the game pass and
data/007607.wav|and asking for szechuan sauce that's
data/002172.wav|yeah out of every single no that sounds wrong
data/012360.wav|we're all the windows are blocked
data/028260.wav|the she is almost in tears describing how terrible this person wants to work with nothing
data/028855.wav|i woke up the next day i don't remember
data/029467.wav|kind of bummed but like they just don't have the budget i guess or they don't have like it's like a
data/009403.wav|if they left the last two picks for the last part of the draft
data/001363.wav|the first letter of your first name and if i can guess it if i can guess it
data/025651.wav|anyone who invested in squid coin the
data/026657.wav|is right now if you were to click the
data/011508.wav|with ride or die with their beliefs
data/009131.wav|because on my last video about
data/000880.wav|i'm looking you up you well you haven't posted at all
data/026869.wav|in mind because this i think in my mind was probably one of the best uses
data/030324.wav|to just excellent music on the beach
data/022252.wav|having a job oh no he lies
data/015252.wav|in there you might get the mandalorian or you
data/019664.wav|in the paper i put some stuff together i wrote
data/003693.wav|the you know like the 20s
data/001165.wav|so unhealthy factor the reason i like it and i've tried every single one and i've ordered
data/004982.wav|it was like you know what big papa
data/026745.wav|at the government's not gonna stop
data/023448.wav|which has to be above price and these three lines explain all aspects of marketing
data/008580.wav|but it's a bit of a beater like it's not
data/016997.wav|do you think any of us are interested in reading books when we could be playing
data/025442.wav|well violence in video games and for that in my mind they win
data/027396.wav|if they nuked everything they've ever done and
data/008021.wav|the wild but like the combat of of i guess
data/000725.wav|well as much money yet then we go back after the dinner and that is when it all breaks
data/007415.wav|i would go with someone else if you have one friend or more that you can go with
data/011944.wav|what are guests total on the whole
data/001857.wav|and then i'm like okay and
data/024557.wav|or dude honestly because even after all this even if the judge
data/014240.wav|given it a shot and you've tried to learn from him
data/031376.wav|and and like the balcony is literally over the waves
data/012952.wav|i'm sure there's some worth but the problem with graduate
data/003026.wav|in the theater which is also something i
data/018173.wav|welcome to the world's first and greatest marketing tuesday look i made a little logo for it today's marketing monday topic marketing tuesday i'm sorry
data/001228.wav|and i've had to hire people
data/019206.wav|if the throwback story so again I was uh I
data/006784.wav|with the basketball i'm not gonna go
data/012139.wav|and i was the one doing this like i would get back to the
data/025980.wav|well a new year with the same quality marketing monday
data/012512.wav|oh important though is you have to buy the room the room is
data/002225.wav|raise his hand and be like
data/007394.wav|it makes more sense you play the game yeah yeah yeah but
data/010705.wav|but bear in mind our rule on clippers yeah it's like santa yeah it happens
data/026415.wav|car companies will run ads just to prevent buyers remorse from their own consumers
data/029317.wav|the show up we show up for this tour and all
data/000992.wav|i think korea does it this way
data/000487.wav|i can't stay awake like my eyes
data/017451.wav|made me okay don't apologize for it let me do
data/019196.wav|not with a with a city you could just throw everything on there and suddenly
data/003581.wav|like housing and and everything was getting out of control for people
data/023690.wav|the first option is car sharing the second option is e-scooters the third
data/030401.wav|my relationship and plans are spoiled another route you find my toothpaste we
data/015647.wav|four year in business they are losing tons of money and they could make a bunch of money by selling like if they just sold survivor to netflix they'd make a
data/030768.wav|as very nice i just don't know
data/012345.wav|here's me with my galactic grabbers this is the face you make or you've just
data/025005.wav|exact terms of the agreement so they could still fulfill the contract they made to
data/017822.wav|whether or not they upgrade their their
data/001434.wav|okay let's make it easier let's make it easier let's make it easier what is the name of one of the star wars movies
data/003677.wav|with and productivity growth it was
data/010407.wav|where i live the only competition is expanding
data/003744.wav|this politician voted a certain way
data/016110.wav|thank you no thank you i think we all learned something from that
data/026779.wav|lose money when their stock value goes down it's a good question no but having a
data/004305.wav|why is your mic just dangling there
data/002915.wav|widespread that it was like the only place you can get a real hit and sometimes people would come to work for netflix like actors and directors because they knew it was like they could get the widest widespread that it was like the only place you could get a real hit and sometimes people would come to work for netflix like um actors and directors
data/020582.wav|i didn't get into it today because it's
data/013366.wav|at tweets of the year 2022
data/019677.wav|in get in contact with mcdonald's
data/019975.wav|was in a slide and this this turned
data/030958.wav|nice to meet you where you
data/023046.wav|and they forced them to change
data/029155.wav|it doesn't work it turns out he had traded me a faulty cartridge with no battery in it you could never save but instead of confronting him i was so obsessed with the game
data/018931.wav|you're the perfect person to be creating a 10 minute
data/024306.wav|or sang at what point but outside of that
data/004180.wav|is he always wants to come on at like two o'clock on a wednesday and i'm like hey love that date i have mentioned a couple

data/014767.wav|personally i don't think it's possible twitch chat
data/019714.wav|don't need to do something about student debt that's the fail okay because i saw this
data/012125.wav|we would like tell each other both sides of what was going on it was it was
data/011501.wav|the clown prince of crime's origin
data/030157.wav|and start from behind and i still i lost my one
data/023829.wav|we'll do this again in the future
data/020554.wav|in the developers a few episodes ago we made a list of the most overhyped games of all time and i said we'll see after launch
data/007145.wav|fun at all i don't want to get
data/013854.wav|taking my business elsewhere you're always lying you're always lying everyone knows
data/031421.wav|are definitely on full display and we're tossing the
data/024504.wav|if you guys don't know the lawsuit kicked off when epic games who was sick and tired of giving a massive cut a
data/024431.wav|if the from that angle yeah i believe the angle matters a lot but it's also like
data/016144.wav|currently suffering through computer science homework
data/032357.wav|i have no definitive proof you cheated
data/008442.wav|champ it's very nice but it does feel like you're a soccer coach talking to your worst player you know what i'm saying like
data/004990.wav|but what i do know is that there's two big outcomes coming forward for this twitter thing and that's one is that the letter of the
data/008511.wav|because he was doing weird things like tweeting at the
data/005753.wav|it's crazy so after the first level of
data/003043.wav|seems like a fail for society yeah
data/008593.wav|would contract to make sure that
data/013807.wav|now i think i'm gonna watch i'm gonna watch
data/026390.wav|or extra cameras or whatever so everyone knows that you spent money on the new
data/024659.wav|in america massively invested in some of these chinese bonds so they're starting to be
data/024979.wav|is about finland is all about like egalitarian
data/001954.wav|if i just recorded you know an hour of
data/030090.wav|go to best buy and they were talking about like you
data/013445.wav|you know strong female character you're just a
data/030479.wav|i was little nervous and my first plan was
data/030337.wav|it's the woman at the end of world war ii
data/009325.wav|it does not make another handheld console i
data/014301.wav|sloshing around for creators to pick up
data/017914.wav|the theater experience is generally different it's there's more excitement in the theater there's people yelling
data/029362.wav|so i order like a big pasta like a the rigatoni and a drink you know i dunno i or i want to fit i don't want to order to like the can so i order like a big pasta like a pasta rigatoni and a drink you know i don't know i want
data/009071.wav|no dude i had like a whole playlist wait i can find this i can find this
data/005320.wav|but you know it's probably i mean it's almost certainly because it was uh a
data/019214.wav|whoa whoa I love this game yes
data/011260.wav|watch stranger things in the dark they didn't see anything it was pretty awesome yeah that sounds good though whoa fall guys
data/002155.wav|that fortnite has never been hotter so it's like a perfect time for me to just get jump right in
data/022490.wav|these corporations but they can do a little
data/020344.wav|didn't feel boring they show a car breaking which is so rare let me just tell you a car ad showing one of their cars getting damaged is so outlandish
data/005477.wav|my my not even my aunt dude i think like my aunt's friend
data/009395.wav|the overall better you know the goat of north america but
data/006559.wav|that's the part where they get
data/002633.wav|for charity have to figure out what
data/012792.wav|it's the guy that was happy he would keep the
data/012064.wav|you know whether or not it was
data/007577.wav|yeah okay i'll get right on it
data/023301.wav|like less than a full euro
data/015134.wav|a concept used to determine how big your business audit idea can be for example if you come up with an idea that's like really good for welders
data/017072.wav|when he was sad it was
data/018117.wav|actually hate this part for real because it doesn't make any sense
data/017521.wav|today is a little bit similar to that
data/015099.wav|today's they have another crisis where it's like okay this could be the end of the
data/018363.wav|if the deeper problems i mean it's all about leverage
data/030633.wav|i'm going to do it and i tell my mom my mom's like
data/000593.wav|the first five minutes i fall asleep now thank god
data/017842.wav|they had a they have a free if the game
data/002166.wav|are not have a list of jokes ready at your
data/002096.wav|and then doing that again and again every single season in
data/006229.wav|flip the table and leave either way they'll be talking about you
data/016082.wav|as well as the episodes themselves
data/021929.wav|i mean i took i took some days off i took what 10 days
data/010362.wav|i can't really i can't talk about that because i play balloons it's not like there's a certain level of class that i'm like i need to hold to
data/000403.wav|we are playing pie gal and we're winning it
data/008089.wav|my ancestors when they got chained up and
data/021145.wav|can still be cringe but i think it's more effective
data/022395.wav|worry this ad is so good and the humanity of it is so good
data/023682.wav|what i'm saying is the easiest way to get free likes
data/023796.wav|like it's all about making hyper relevant content that people would find funny for yeah
data/020998.wav|it wasn't just funny for this for the sake of being let random the
data/023431.wav|i know especially people that are like
data/007659.wav|i will play inscription before i
data/015339.wav|is that basically for them content is not a
data/020931.wav|us basically your profit are thin in a competitive industry you don't make very much fat margin
data/018295.wav|you know i used to have
data/001059.wav|my favorite chatter long time sub
data/000283.wav|it's amazing when we we have
data/030998.wav|well apartments were getting so pissed that there was an article about landlords that were secretly burning their own apartments down to get the tenants out so they could rebuild
data/000847.wav|we believe day months illegal bagel them with eight months illegal bagel thing in
data/008373.wav|is that you can just hit the thing and yeah taco bells are crazy they're
data/018812.wav|the establishment this is the early example of the
data/010487.wav|the community i did a little
data/028571.wav|at the end of the day not only did he not let me pay
data/024413.wav|with ads for other goods and services on top of paid dlc and pack openings yes
data/009817.wav|what did he say he said on good news
data/011307.wav|when people in chat yes okay um

data/007055.wav|his name his birth name was kush and his birthday was
data/029335.wav|guy who plays a lot of league like a
data/000909.wav|i'm desk warming in japan watching this muted on my phone this is not the right stream to watch muted on your phone do you know what i'm saying there's not there's not enough to take from this if
data/001749.wav|it's just literally it's the old man like smiling and walking away with his son as this guy drowns to death behind the
data/025137.wav|we need to follow that up with a dub this is a well earned dub to jif peanut butter i was now people

data/008033.wav|i want to be playing as much as i can
data/011890.wav|if there wasn't as many kids you'd think
data/029724.wav|so the thing is that he saw the winner set where
data/001980.wav|it's interesting because you know remember how
data/021445.wav|sure to end up losing you money
data/029301.wav|we don't have any open internships but i'm
data/026228.wav|and they don't want to say late fees they don't
data/007267.wav|i said more of the story where did i cut out i forgot
data/023737.wav|there's some competitors you can probably think of that have pretty big markups raycon does
data/013781.wav|well there's one option that we've just heard about
data/023783.wav|mercedes shooting people and get filmed that's one of the
data/002797.wav|like i said i bought a new mic just to
data/004753.wav|what your different loans that had different
data/015119.wav|the actors but you might know who it is they launched house of cards and
data/029789.wav|the that was sort of the fall of scar as a player and

data/016635.wav|solar has gotten cheaper and cheaper and cheaper rapidly dramatically
data/025004.wav|quote unquote bring a bunch of jobs to america and then made a bunch of essentially fake factories and empty they bought a bunch of office buildings and filled them with like four employees just to fill the exact
data/031186.wav|it had a lot of stuff that's just a hard thing to do and i think the stuff he did around
data/002467.wav|and they they had no affinity
data/015062.wav|we're up with this love this show they got it for 30 million dollars a year which is
data/024866.wav|and of their income it's from targeting these
data/014001.wav|there will not be more hats unfortunately the factory
data/024053.wav|the act to reverse their uh
data/002944.wav|ryan gosling talked about his past where
data/030282.wav|i bury the body before his parents get
data/030441.wav|you're going to find your special someone
data/011695.wav|if the racks i might as well try to have a good
data/028879.wav|by the 11th one i realized
data/007056.wav|and i always thought that was like poetic justice from his parents
data/028385.wav|back and forth until both of them die i'm pretty sure there's just five
data/029146.wav|i could think about nothing else all day at school i got home i popped
data/019470.wav|it's that she's got a woman's voice and you
data/001445.wav|i mean the bachelor party ideas i mean i'm doing the
data/008608.wav|good to go and he's in and and
data/005402.wav|and and i was like that sounds dope because i'm a hustler grinder and i want
data/002920.wav|it was any numbers and whatever they say they're very secretive about it
data/030423.wav|who like was like street smart
data/004895.wav|yup shares of twitter because he's a very
data/014183.wav|the the drop a dozen ads every hour we
data/023961.wav|it's going to be a marketing monday on a
data/025745.wav|and it has a warning at the beginning oh
data/009848.wav|you'd think i'd go at least one time but nope
data/019342.wav|the market in every single city and i put it in quotes in this presentation like a
data/026430.wav|there is a much higher chance than let's say
data/017116.wav|jeff jeff freak show xf stingy evil slake
data/003893.wav|i don't think anyone beats him in the primary of republican side
data/023864.wav|this is another win this campaign from
data/009666.wav|now for some real i think
data/009025.wav|that's what i said it was a maybe a marketing monday
data/006194.wav|his a house on fire all right
data/030817.wav|cause i didn't want to be much
data/018149.wav|i will not be stopped i will not be stopped i won't be stopped
data/028952.wav|cause i would be like the the foreign exchange
data/012221.wav|at the event whatever we're facing off and we get a i
data/012193.wav|the that a prison or something because chewbacca
data/017162.wav|like okay we'll do another run even though they weren't gonna because of the copyright on the hat
data/031423.wav|this was the problem okay this dog came with a family which came with kids two kids to be specific who were the neighbors okay the neighbors who apparently did not know this house
data/030503.wav|at the conversation like i got
data/008815.wav|it's awful business move awfully bad but it's it's not
data/019817.wav|this is a spreadsheet of all the things they probably this
data/016638.wav|the costs are predicted to be even lower and
data/025906.wav|if you know if you are backed against the wall
data/023145.wav|do our our bodies it needs to look good
data/021663.wav|they got an extremely likable spokesman they put their brand everywhere they realized everyone's kind
data/017170.wav|a new year with the same quality marketing monday
data/007051.wav|you solve stop the birth of hitler i i
data/011835.wav|go on so it's pretty empty except for
data/016337.wav|apparently his body never needs to use a toilet because it apparently is quote unquote
data/004228.wav|it would have prevented more scams at the height of the scammy period but doing it now is like
data/002513.wav|alright what's wrong with having a little fun
data/000831.wav|the guy doing you know crazy
data/000385.wav|saturday night was the drunkest i've been in a long time i i i you know
data/025778.wav|into the role after realizing she was only hired as a gesture of tokenism to have a
data/027146.wav|it's basically hot potato and so they've been passing this back and forth and just every time they
data/020099.wav|okay but they had really really good operating systems when you're acquiring
data/008612.wav|locked and so now you know it's that's that's the whole that's
data/003739.wav|super pacs and donate money to them and it was protected as speech
data/004312.wav|have to talk about today we
data/022807.wav|the online at its peak one most importantly they charged you by the hour and it was slow it was
data/002626.wav|it has to be reversed okay so instead of heads heads tails
data/008010.wav|that i am deeply enamored with
data/001120.wav|now you can't grind nearly as hard fuchsia unfortunately your obligations to friends and your life means you cannot be a complete and total
data/028663.wav|it's all diamonds okay basically all these jewels i buy a bunch of those i go to work now at 11 probably
data/013216.wav|what do not copy and be heard
data/012441.wav|we should switch sides because the only person i've been
data/022524.wav|is that it it takes things that are your core brand values things you want people to know about you things that are are central to your brand and pushes them to extremes in a funny way you know so let me show you example of a really good april
data/009897.wav|once a guy from new zealand told me that people say new zealanders and canadians are similar and i responded must be the accent and he didn't realize it was a joke and was like uh no i don't think so
data/006632.wav|i think luca outscored the other team
data/026579.wav|can literally just tell you that this is a bad idea but number two if you're gonna
data/000720.wav|and he's been talking to people and after
data/003016.wav|it was like my adrenaline was up
data/027264.wav|give that because it's distinct and i want to
data/020279.wav|yeah there's no celebrities in this and the fact they say you know in the summertime when things are fun santa
data/000271.wav|so i drank quite a bit i'm putting i'm
data/006644.wav|watch nhl ever that's the game with ice right
data/031664.wav|but the crazy thing is the people watching league were getting hyped they were getting torqued they were
data/010969.wav|so let's watch the latest trailer for minions rise of
data/027613.wav|random rank and file employees i don't think there's like a mass firing
data/003260.wav|with published which you can't do because it wouldn't be
data/020945.wav|it's like if you're like i'm going to start an instagram for my dog
data/024044.wav|and they were like rejuvenating their
data/009112.wav|in the middle of the day
data/028856.wav|at all i have no idea so i just
data/011972.wav|three groups and they have you have like loyalty points it doesn't really show your
data/019310.wav|is a competition there's only like 20 students in the class they are broken
data/027892.wav|in a mall for no rent at all and they just get a cut of your revenue like right now you can go to a popular mall and there's a decent chance you can get literal
data/029737.wav|now there's a void what am i gonna
data/010288.wav|good friend why would i not ask the amazing and talented cutie cinderella there's just no reason there's just no reason to leave cutie cinderella out and i you know what i just think she's so busy lately she's got so many events and she's just running around town and and it's just like i wouldn't want to
data/012000.wav|with a little bit of a boys
data/004165.wav|got engaged today but still can't skip marketing monday i
data/015406.wav|is actually good and makes money or if it's only good for the customer but actually loses money because one thing disney has said
data/027211.wav|prior to the release of demon souls which barely edged it out from there they gained a cult following and when they released dark souls two years later it
data/023365.wav|and that they were talking about the cheating thing so i went to check it and i
data/023712.wav|the topic is literally just the funniest ads of all time part due let's see what you guys submitted
data/027920.wav|his baby and let's ignore the fail of this false data that says there's an
data/011881.wav|yeah here it is so i got to be in the front of the ship like by myself because no one was
data/002953.wav|huh but it doesn't feel like it's entered the cultural consciousness for all that money
data/003888.wav|is the favorite right now he's actually the favorite overall if you look at betting odds but i think trump is
data/000548.wav|you know we all have these
data/029592.wav|all of the top players kind of took little
data/011408.wav|he's considered by many myself included to be the greatest player of all time and he's been top five forever forever and ever and ever and they recently put out a ranking where they put him on
data/006928.wav|and sometimes i rinse but i don't wash my
data/000470.wav|need the blt and the second i lay down in the bed i
data/020429.wav|where you buy pepsi only because you
data/028881.wav|word them in a cup and made me chug the cup but the reason i did
data/015986.wav|if the company in the world they can lose money on game pass to hopefully get a dominant
data/011352.wav|it's the whole like it was the whole crux of their business starting out and like now it's like they're they're kind
data/010870.wav|every person that's quit league wakes
data/001764.wav|there was a tiny bit of a point
data/024359.wav|we like the core concept was interesting visually interesting you know i'm not bored halfway through i kind of want to
data/021730.wav|good 30 second ad right off the bat
data/018237.wav|if the kids saying hey dad the jeep you bought can pull a bigger boat than we currently have
data/024761.wav|i want that and just buy it everything you want is behind some sort of lottery system that adds excitement
data/026036.wav|so you can find that compares to that is
data/023859.wav|well coke and everyone thought they won and so sales of the original coke spiked so rather than hurting coke it was one
data/011961.wav|and you start getting text messages from the actors that you've either met or done things with and it's it's obviously not them writing
data/028361.wav|office lingo that i have long resisted and now succumbed to
data/009487.wav|at them so much goal that gets inflated and becomes worthless it's still going to genius if at them so much gold that gets inflated and becomes worthless
data/020677.wav|put the building in fortnite so you know that's that's that's something congratulations hundred thieves wow hundred thieves still celebrating actually
data/017666.wav|you are more likely to feel validated in your purchase it's less likely to feel buyer's remorse
data/016051.wav|well you just put money in and invest
data/000660.wav|and i think ludwig was doing the thing we had done the day before where he was running over to
data/006092.wav|okay well that's funny i should have explained i didn't even think about that
data/002376.wav|making large financial bets although i will tell you i
data/030833.wav|or watch this stream which one
data/023740.wav|we have qualities these are now my number one
data/001495.wav|simple question i'm gonna go with green
data/014006.wav|these are almost sold out if you would like the dope nickname
data/021726.wav|it's fake views and that to me
data/016378.wav|i mean that didn't technically go to fraudulent pure fraud people that just didn't have
data/022164.wav|way of using emotion and tying your products uses
data/011050.wav|if you have to cut them loose i swear to god stands has been playing league of
data/000075.wav|it was like building something for aatrox
data/008968.wav|it's a lot of things that he is signing that he agrees that like he's he's reviewed all that he wants to review about twitter he agrees to buy it as is
data/015809.wav|if you're not growing you're sort of
data/017077.wav|it's an event it happened we should remark on it we shouldn't get all upset about
data/008242.wav|is going to be on the
data/031114.wav|that's whenever people knew this guy's got what it takes or
data/014711.wav|the solve world water issues did she ask she's
data/011636.wav|pretty recently and i thought for two days
data/012989.wav|for things that you don't learn any deep thoughts about it's not impossible
data/009365.wav|i don't think i don't think so i don't think so
data/019424.wav|was like wow i don't remember who that was for it's so important so putting it in your jingle very important
data/014348.wav|of gamers at a certain subset of hyper online people and it's it's big but
data/029208.wav|it's finals they will watch these
data/002466.wav|the for a party like it was like a super bowl party and they bought 20 bags of chips
data/026412.wav|that's what dealerships are better they have a better purchase experience which makes their brand stronger post purchase they have
data/029611.wav|and zayn's almost like they did they
data/027783.wav|of course more than everything the
data/005474.wav|because it's like it's like almost admitting that it's gone too far it's gone too far um but
data/021422.wav|it's also one of the ways robin hood makes their money let me explain
data/006797.wav|that point he didn't win again
data/024161.wav|because when ninja came back from mixer he did that
data/007174.wav|work on my stream for a minute after he had a breakout performance at this new york tournament
data/005733.wav|i think he knows what he's doing
data/025347.wav|is that um the the the
data/015936.wav|or not they're not they're not
data/026185.wav|thank god for scientists always pushing things forward in ways that we really do need
data/028920.wav|is that we get near the top of this hill and i'm so drunk and like loud and belligerent and like just also miserable and i shove this girl and again i feel very bad about this i think trying to like pat her on the back not
data/028980.wav|an awful and awful and sick and
data/000522.wav|and uh i with the piano
data/001479.wav|only going to have chat open nobody is on
data/027991.wav|what's happening the only difference between this situation starfield which was one of
data/013589.wav|now you know things have gone wrong
data/008585.wav|twice what that car is worth i'll pay
data/005251.wav|i smile and i go hey all
data/026514.wav|you'd think again you'd think so many times that gamers would be the ones on board with this but the way it's shaped out is that gamers are actually the most vehement
data/017661.wav|if the packaging room where they have people
data/002861.wav|but for the difference between the current share price and the share price he promised to pay for so basically here's what it is now
data/021816.wav|your heart and hit that button and turn it from red to gray it would really mean a lot
data/018380.wav|in other words he had a monopoly monopoly
data/025234.wav|if you guys know a week or two ago they banned people under
data/001208.wav|it started in marketing that's hustle culture gone wrong just be
data/032374.wav|it bosses and everyone in chat
data/000310.wav|at the time so no matter what on sunday if we're up we're just not
data/024406.wav|that makes you think wow i'm in a real living breathing world and that's why when i saw this footage from the latest
data/011044.wav|the connotation well let's keep it
data/009084.wav|not for at least two hours
data/010856.wav|and that is a little cringe because
data/015359.wav|you can have it already pre-cut
data/002577.wav|andorra roll dice alright we're gonna roll a dice all right we're
data/000751.wav|it just reminded me i just felt very lucky uh it
data/032398.wav|it's weird because he did say
data/013937.wav|whatever they call them because they use a lot of
data/017313.wav|if they have very high churn which is like people that join and then quit the the fact they added this many new
data/029755.wav|trust you you better have a total monopoly on
data/007981.wav|you don't know this but actually i've explained elizabeth targets a lot before
data/013991.wav|because it just feels like you get none of the pain your brain is like wait no pain all gain at the moment i click
data/007733.wav|drop to your door knock on it twice dance a little jig and then
data/027959.wav|wow you can just tell that he was not a
data/026582.wav|i pokey and apologize and say whatever
data/008297.wav|stop girl you listening to coffee cow while you grind
data/006697.wav|me watching youtube they get which they were worried about because youtube is a
data/024370.wav|that is the budget of many small movies
data/015248.wav|and there's a big spike in hulu around
data/000872.wav|with the people at random and i'm
data/018124.wav|yes i got them the pepsi one second dude that's called clutch
data/010396.wav|they're trying to silence me and you know what i will let them because i have no choice because internet in america is a
data/026834.wav|long know that it costs about 14 million
data/029814.wav|or legacy or something like that and i
data/010911.wav|we don't necessarily want that even because i already have the minions
data/007092.wav|a solo sheik has never won a major
data/001741.wav|would win the bet if someone goes overboard he can win the bet so
data/012399.wav|now they warned us they warned us this in the safety briefing that it's not a
data/017231.wav|well for his genius marketing obviously but they didn't kill him
data/027875.wav|i bought a recession i can't tell you
data/013881.wav|and i would have given him a win but unfortunately when things do well in the gaming industry
data/004098.wav|i don't think i was sick i think i was just really
data/012960.wav|i was like people use grad school to ride out
data/021644.wav|at the gm is finally flipping their stance from
data/002127.wav|well party four hours ago today a big third party just get voted and
data/000840.wav|out of nowhere being like yeah
data/005130.wav|i don't got a lot this weekend
data/004880.wav|in children with the executives there so i'm not sure that this truly applies there's no way
data/027107.wav|well i think the safe assumption
data/031475.wav|that which is crazy you think about how money's how much
data/012080.wav|and i start to find out all my boys who
data/000750.wav|i've been just streaming and working and they just
data/005663.wav|well just because like among streamers i think there's like everyone's i
data/025489.wav|a little secret that comes out halfway through so let's watch it
data/014678.wav|obviously it's not water war wednesday
data/026709.wav|the leadership all of the owners of uh
data/022258.wav|is that got me we need a breather okay
data/029920.wav|are feeling like butterflies in my stomach because
data/010955.wav|let's see okay you see this and that way i need to get
data/027935.wav|you are near that amount uh but
data/030271.wav|i thought i saw a meadow and a flower it was a golden retriever in a meadow it was dog shampoo it was so obvious in hindsight every single thing had a picture of a
data/021742.wav|i was five seconds long all
data/003240.wav|your readers i assume there's maybe one of you among the five thousand i'm sure
data/008948.wav|was that smart i think he i think he sold tesla shares at the top just because like most ceos at the time
data/001140.wav|you're hungry we could start early
data/010572.wav|they found a way to make a commodity like oil better so i'm i'm calling him chevron
data/024023.wav|on their platform they understand that titties makes them money
data/031003.wav|and okay so my relationship with
data/009698.wav|was before just watch the new vid bud
data/010715.wav|you're not you're not going to go down in money
data/018920.wav|and better than he does and that of course is meg whitman meg
data/020129.wav|we started posting memes wendy's dropped a mixtape
data/023546.wav|and the plan is once you get everyone
data/014096.wav|wait there if you're a big
data/008993.wav|in the heat dude that's that is sick and the reason i'm not laughing
data/022826.wav|some of the cash flow of
data/021799.wav|america we were getting so divided as a nation i was thinking
data/009156.wav|ten month decline then i would be mad at him i wouldn't be
data/031764.wav|what the cringe the finale episode is called cringe
data/019009.wav|what said could fit a quarter
data/024859.wav|flexing and uniqueness people want to feel like they
data/010294.wav|the only reason lyric is like
data/010160.wav|right here and i just i don't know why that was a donation goal you assume the people that are donating right they're either fans of yours
data/032136.wav|they had their whole accountant staff
data/009268.wav|well you better vote you better vote who's going
data/015823.wav|the on you might be fun to react well let me do
data/012312.wav|i think the food the food kind of hyped me up
data/021511.wav|a hedge fund manager is like he goes around
data/030728.wav|the correct answer was nobody nobody
data/015123.wav|with a hollywood didn't because they'd already
data/020954.wav|i thought about that you're right i want to marry them i want to change my opinion
data/028665.wav|with a bag of diamonds i dump it on his
data/011826.wav|worse now so everything's all star wars and it gives you like the map of the ship and it gives you like
data/028000.wav|or narrative at least in the west for the first half of the year has been like xbox firing on all cylinders but with both red fall and starfield a big exclusive
data/024258.wav|i play his character from the matrix by the way the matrix came out
data/003743.wav|and you think man it would be good if this
data/012775.wav|pro team in college like this is when i'm grinding every day top of the ladder like like optimizing for i would do i would wake up and do like
data/029764.wav|in that environment like at air
data/032215.wav|five minutes in because we can't wait
data/006598.wav|so anyway that's a big win to sony
data/009645.wav|of our towers are down what
data/022440.wav|what our values are and be actually kind of blatant with it because most people are kind of dumb the one more thing i learned from apple is the power of product as a marketing feature and it
data/011403.wav|and months nick w they've been four months
data/029388.wav|it was like there was no chance i
data/018198.wav|being able to say that alone is already a win that's probably something
data/006247.wav|what holiday like what is the holiday
data/027028.wav|we out of ideas it was
data/000786.wav|some of the really fancy stuff
data/009652.wav|it's probably a bad example but it
data/022291.wav|maybe it's like the story of two brothers who grow up maybe they play a
data/004242.wav|i made some money on crypto robert stacks
data/020337.wav|him or relations whatever was necessary to be
data/007117.wav|in southern watching the seasons while i do a lot of work i've been watching the seasons well i do
data/004677.wav|if for one if it out of a million paths
data/014132.wav|in the platform but it's not growing to

data/004433.wav|will say keep it up keep it up king it's the best no
data/026023.wav|it's so i told christopher robin that anyone can
data/020012.wav|and they're starting to interact with sports in new ways the internet is really disrupting
data/002823.wav|after week lately sex life uh
data/001985.wav|because you only have to hire like one or two employees you don't need a lot of real estate for the shop and you don't need to
data/025110.wav|most places like you're going to complain
data/023585.wav|i think subject i know it's a little it's actually one of my most intense marketing streams not too many jokes but i uh i i
data/007054.wav|he was like head of music or something twitch music which
data/025631.wav|why do they make on this war everything sony and microsoft is making in their respective xbox and
data/015448.wav|if their weakness okay because while they're very good at this stuff it's
data/016956.wav|and so uh feel free to check that out
data/023752.wav|geico 15 minutes could save you

data/002925.wav|what am i watched it and it was
data/014804.wav|if you sign up and use it for i think at least
data/027992.wav|what reputation going into it this is
data/026310.wav|going to see gucci fendi prada and apple they've
data/020734.wav|in awards these awards begin with the worst

data/004495.wav|am i likable well i don't know water jug what's your what would you say is your how similar are you to shaq is the real
data/018587.wav|does their thing and they're good at it and
data/005036.wav|and then you get 5 000
data/026489.wav|it actually they they just tweeted about movies
data/000530.wav|i said i've always been into watches but um
data/007817.wav|is the shirtless picture and so i'll do that tomorrow we'll do targeting
data/025135.wav|i feel bad for the guy but you probably did get
data/019643.wav|with the story behind this jingle yeah
data/017480.wav|and there's there's a rise in general labor movements and they're having success and i just want to say personally that i deeply support these and if you in your
data/006524.wav|and has a bigger install base
data/023155.wav|looks like this into a burger that looks like this you know what i'm saying people want what they cracked up to be
data/011788.wav|at the video i think so let me show you what it was i was probably
data/004099.wav|exhausted heading into monday but i recovered i'm totally back
data/028050.wav|for the amazon labor union so they couldn't even repeat their victory for their second whereas the only got one warehouse we will see how it plays out i'm i'm i'm hoping and praying that the the for the amazon labor union so they couldn't even repeat their victory for their second warehouse they only got one warehouse we
data/011721.wav|okay and then i pull open
data/001139.wav|well it's not 8 o'clock yet
data/020403.wav|mr and he has to be here in the freezing cold at a gas station somebody's
data/001290.wav|i see if they can do it
data/004104.wav|this was fine and nobody nobody there was no bad outcome
data/020035.wav|from our boys at google they just keep on
data/010159.wav|the aren't annoyed but they actually like it so
data/005286.wav|right now i am trying to build wealth so that i can eventually buy a nice house
data/007777.wav|what is it that by the way
data/017403.wav|if the image you go to google images and unfortunately when they went to google images and
data/002106.wav|i was gonna say do you guys remember on marketing monday this week
data/012537.wav|like all right so you have to tap your little data pad your little you have a wristband that opens all the doors and like unlocks based on your
data/000735.wav|at that point it's almost a
data/012331.wav|things inside of them and it was
data/024404.wav|this fail is on every other gaming developer because the gauntlet has been thrown
data/004709.wav|except of course across the nation this great nation and world were playing the greatest album of all time the
data/007112.wav|something about how jeff bezos is a business legend
data/004715.wav|help with the video and i told him in discord
data/025117.wav|worse is it possible that they were getting fined for their underhanded content
data/012973.wav|to teachers they yell at teachers they blame teachers for
data/013196.wav|like i'm joking i'm not i'm being
data/008754.wav|so they have to take the deal if it's
data/000576.wav|every every hour of every day all all three days
data/025699.wav|world would be fantastic no comment ps3 it only does everything now
data/018286.wav|so much is this let me share it with you
data/024045.wav|their love for the brand they felt
data/020583.wav|it's more of a business talk marketing monday
data/015361.wav|check out lily bank if that interests you and if you are spamming taxes and you are not eight years old i would be worried because it is coming and you will have to pay it so check them out link
data/021146.wav|public transport you're right really gives you the authentic public transportation experience you just
data/003452.wav|while the chips and it's very very important and if taiwan were to
data/028589.wav|add like diamond and master and all that
data/022823.wav|the internet we don't really get it
data/021154.wav|cause i hadn't heard about this but apparently this has a lot of nostalgia be safe around trains it was a mobile game with a fun ad and people liked it
data/001601.wav|i legitimately think you'll find it
data/028661.wav|fake jewel i'm trying to show you what
data/031722.wav|we're episodes have yet to be found wow are there
data/018631.wav|i and play the game on xbox game pass you'd have the xbox machine in your living room it would be a whole ecosystem because that's how gamers that is the most important thing for
data/030860.wav|i kicked him i kicked him i kicked him i
data/019144.wav|no let me tell you I'm not
data/024508.wav|where you could use direct payment and get a
data/007612.wav|i said a little bit sussy in the chat
data/022436.wav|human psychology and it worked i think we all know that it worked i mean apple especially in the years since these ads
data/022073.wav|the sad thing as i forgot what i was on
data/020653.wav|of reasons it cannot go to the real winner cutie cinderella cutie cinderella did win this award
data/020921.wav|i think passions change passions are very whimsical i was extremely passionate about starcraft and league of legends professional play and if i told myself this is what i have to do this is my dream if i because literally at one point i was grinding league 15 hours a day and eventually thanks to
data/024506.wav|well on ios to apple created their own direct payment service and they just
data/024842.wav|we're all let's say we've all started um
data/023876.wav|this sucks because we were already
data/009864.wav|it's pretty great i think i think
data/000826.wav|that was very fun and then there's a lot of
data/008597.wav|in all that stuff so then he signs it
data/032181.wav|at the time and that is
data/021674.wav|i gotta put this probably in mediocre this guy what if the
data/021178.wav|if the trend that i want to get into is that
data/023760.wav|this is a long time ago when i
data/002342.wav|if you have to be up in four hours
data/009473.wav|yeah that's that's how you win a
data/032053.wav|i just meant he had large expense
data/027788.wav|it's disposal really and that is to make it more expensive to borrow money
data/032029.wav|called you the logan paul with
data/012298.wav|you credits they gave you credits
data/004819.wav|this just came out this came out yesterday
data/023222.wav|and that is what it takes to be a god gamer if you guys
data/029567.wav|if there was um it's funny because
data/010600.wav|i have successfully lowered the bar
data/001186.wav|cause canadian people have complained to me but that's that's all i can say worth
data/024687.wav|if the the ground safe points at the
data/009870.wav|of europe like quickly like i could jump on a ryanair flight
data/006743.wav|where's my phone dude i got the funniest
data/031087.wav|at the beginning of the year back when he was
data/003865.wav|say like i don't you you'd hope it would be about the
data/017540.wav|height of its power when it had a standing army
data/021419.wav|it's okay and it was hurting
data/012836.wav|did when they bought the company was look at the expense report or whatever and they were
data/007257.wav|it's a meme and i and if
data/001446.wav|i don't have any wild ideas
data/022470.wav|the nike was getting into skateboarding and
data/016316.wav|jeff bezos is trying to get in the goat discussion
data/031997.wav|to roast scar honestly i wish you were ten percent uglier but then you'd be
data/023839.wav|as a kid he already had a kid but he's
data/015032.wav|netflix all the movies you want
data/028061.wav|electronics revolution the marketing was incredibly good
data/014284.wav|that are tough to fill quickly by new content
data/001477.wav|and i realized that even if they don't
data/001027.wav|i'll give you that speaking of tabs this one's about a hyundai plant in alabama where there was
data/026675.wav|i didn't get huge viewership but unfortunately the leadership at twitch and this sort
data/020426.wav|can we get our first zero
data/006529.wav|girl interest but that the fine print tells a
data/017638.wav|wigan dollars to open this is
data/003377.wav|let me find the video here it is
data/016598.wav|of all time they're just in a growing
data/014777.wav|that you can use to um easily categorize your expenses
data/009080.wav|i don't think you needed to close with that but i am happy that the
data/013957.wav|they will give you as much money as possible and lock you
data/017613.wav|extremely expensive luxury temple to the brand if you
data/024965.wav|uber is the most hated brand in america canada
data/020518.wav|they were fantastic they are very good at marketing and if the
data/010469.wav|now they've deleted the old stuff
data/001358.wav|and i did say kill on site and
data/013520.wav|the dollar make the tax man holla
data/032402.wav|it was essential as i thought dodging i literally don't think i
data/000415.wav|and then the lady the lady goes she's
data/010788.wav|with your point at least on your own
data/027509.wav|growing rapidly snapchat growing rapidly twitter has maintained a small amount of daily
data/023057.wav|kind of a sacrifice they're kind of a martyr
data/013802.wav|you guys are literally on a worse
data/005223.wav|it because there's probably a lot of other
data/012586.wav|in time and now i have like two and a half grand of disney stock in
data/031365.wav|in feeling it stan's myself ludwig and our
data/031266.wav|we had like two groups of mutualists you can
data/032387.wav|this is within probably 20 attempts
data/010554.wav|league of legends i'm not playing
data/008468.wav|are not keeping the stream going but i do appreciate your humbleness your
data/015935.wav|thumbnail generation that makes you more likely to watch shows based on what else you've watched the thumbnails are tailored basically to what your preferences
data/017651.wav|they are temples to the brand and
data/025416.wav|the fully realized unreal engine 5 ray
data/000851.wav|it sounding but every child grows up that isn't every adult is a child that grew up that's not so true it's not like
data/022504.wav|because it's like it associates their brand with
data/028924.wav|it's girl into a bush and she like fell down into this
data/010643.wav|at eight o'clock at around eight o'clock i'm gonna i'm gonna talk about the feature film nay the cinematic masterpiece
data/029309.wav|i would love to work on riot he's like you can come i'm
data/018426.wav|wait for the controller and then
data/024357.wav|we have anything to do with beer and the ending reveal is you know it's okay
data/023769.wav|in the devito let's find out i've had three people try to eat me
data/007715.wav|i didn't i couldn't speak with anyone
data/024913.wav|ninety plus roles but in general the idea
data/031178.wav|the dollars you know like mixer or youtube or twitch would have paid him absurd money
data/026793.wav|advertisers generally are looking for a high high net worth or
data/024890.wav|that game when you're doing some kind of dungeon
data/028335.wav|is now it's game three and the air in the room has changed because first of all
data/003361.wav|and i do think there are many um
data/005307.wav|and so you have to wait
data/008879.wav|what that they shoot no no no
data/016478.wav|back on the left here before he became
data/007393.wav|it really exhausting for me so i just don't it's not fun it's like
data/005492.wav|but i you know i showed up to this family gathering and almost everyone was
data/028411.wav|if the or again in military they say landline if your officer
data/020728.wav|this is it cost them literally nothing they could just type it and it went viral so congratulations for one of the
data/016721.wav|that's an aggregate time of more than nine billion hours
data/000789.wav|one as well as love but
data/004553.wav|say a couple words off camera anyway
data/006336.wav|i recently and you're feeling good about an interview but the last time i did interview based content was a year and a half ago and everything i've done recently is
data/028048.wav|you'll get fired which encourages them
data/004964.wav|a twitter employee um for example
data/029102.wav|i did spam bird jesus a lot
data/021274.wav|i don't know what number i landed there's
data/030754.wav|it sometimes you could tell right off the bat a
data/000563.wav|your friends aren't gambling what i thought they were they were crazy youtubers by the way we have been gambling but we haven't been we didn't get player cards or they can't track us
data/011957.wav|i'm going to fit into it because i don't really
data/027313.wav|it probably a great thing it's that for people
data/004250.wav|nowhere near a bank and it's from a military exercise near a naval base they are actually not rolling out tanks in front of major chinese banks
data/010247.wav|dick peppering game but it's kind of like um
data/016198.wav|you know what the best part about
data/009444.wav|in a good chunk of damage from tyler1
data/021299.wav|i mean general okay it's been very good and so what does that mean
data/030334.wav|old photos from back when facebook was used
data/013692.wav|because it spiked it's the only
data/030984.wav|in stereotype literally his name was vladimir i'm not kidding
data/010878.wav|oh they would respect my energy
data/010713.wav|you know what i'm saying even if you
data/015444.wav|pixar movies they're just they're just bigger they have a better bench they
data/025361.wav|you said hell here or something like they were like pointing out anytime i had cursed like you said ass in
data/017620.wav|the product volume the amount of product of
data/027356.wav|the nucleus what's the core thing that is
data/023680.wav|one second are you defending this
data/000936.wav|it's a chance to win something and i like your moxie and
data/012488.wav|i got to see things i missed
data/004847.wav|just straight up to fill the gap in between
data/015145.wav|they've issued junk bonds to get
data/024383.wav|war so they cost they cost a lot of money
data/014955.wav|just generally makes it a lot easier to keep your stuff in line and in order
data/025163.wav|what a joke you know okay here's what
data/013848.wav|it's the same and this is russell
data/031430.wav|so that was the only downside the funniest part of the beach that wasn't even the real tragedy the real tragedy is we almost lost this man we almost lost a great man the nathan
data/011645.wav|you can imagine you can get like a
data/011703.wav|the drive into the staff entrance so like there's a big staff parking lot that's like a million miles wide behind
data/017314.wav|the jobs means they've hired even more people than that so it's one of the largest
data/024617.wav|what the question and so they are uh
data/022427.wav|in pictures movies stuff like that
data/001156.wav|it's been a constant supporter of the stream i super
data/016384.wav|williams of dollars printed and sent to the wrong people that
data/009390.wav|is that crazy to say i think of this entire group the best
data/021521.wav|the concept it's just a way of attacking wealthy
data/023675.wav|hey sawweedy and thought to myself
data/010471.wav|if you don't drink coffee great answer for you i don't call myself the coffee
data/015129.wav|okay this is working let's let's double down so this guy
data/029849.wav|i am going to stand here and i'm going to
data/015724.wav|but i think i got over the
data/017724.wav|well users please don't forget that a green bubble is a real person the green and blue bubble
data/032292.wav|if voice sounds just a teensy bit gone
data/016834.wav|you know mineral mining or transportation will be extremely more feasible
data/031546.wav|he built it as like a a desperate gambit you build the
data/010021.wav|there's literally an snl sketch that
data/013381.wav|it's an empty flights to maintain takeoff and
data/009226.wav|and broke his sister's scooter i also hit hard my head hard but i'm probably okay anyways hope you have a good stream okay you did you did say hit hard my head
data/027317.wav|this is probably the downside but this perception
data/000706.wav|no else was doing it and i was going to be
data/031646.wav|the korean players because they couldn't figure out how to like get
data/000875.wav|jake four four five six you
data/007628.wav|and i'm like sure maybe that's true it almost certainly is true but
data/030632.wav|weird you know i don't want to be like nerdy or whatever but i do know a good amount so the night before i decide i'm going
data/023639.wav|big corporations doing it to where it's like okay even if you're an
data/002881.wav|in order to reduce the amount of money he has to pay
data/003292.wav|no i'm laughing but it's because it's because inflation has been rising bear with me
data/028397.wav|what to move the needle all the time as per my last email
data/031480.wav|all of the wealth it it
data/013262.wav|it's too many jokes how did that car blow up good question good question
data/010439.wav|i'm really excited to see you all there for sure bible
data/008539.wav|so it you know what i think is more
data/024491.wav|oh they did and i'm gonna
data/011959.wav|so that's how i figure i'm going
data/012455.wav|fire doesn't pay that great but he's super zealous but he's like what they make up in credits or
data/027610.wav|i think sums up what most of them are thinking can someone tell me if i'm rich or if i'm fired i think they're all just trying to figure this out
data/001676.wav|the dumbest russian voyage nobody talks about
data/027406.wav|i have realized that taxes were getting increasingly complicated for people that they didn't need to be because the irs already knows for the
data/025916.wav|well this is an american company blizzard owned by an american company activision riot games
data/025383.wav|league of nothing just league of
data/022167.wav|am receiving the phone call and the mom is like not sure if the kid is dead or not and then they find out that the kid is okay only because of the subaru's
data/021777.wav|this one needs to be watched and that of
data/002292.wav|it would not work for a twitch streamer
data/021713.wav|we're at the end which our brains automatically tune out it doesn't make you think
data/015061.wav|popular valuable shows people binge it like crazy even
data/026005.wav|the billions of dollars without actually
data/000605.wav|awesome that was one of the
data/007707.wav|finally get my goal right that makes a lot of sense
data/021980.wav|okay somebody has to wake up early and stand off camera with a gun pointed at this woman
data/001110.wav|we all have interests and you can find some that are similar and make friends over that
data/019455.wav|or head it's too much work we only usually have one or two or three that we like okay and so getting into that consideration set is very important
data/025706.wav|crux of this ad he's scared he gets the
data/013895.wav|boring preamble to what will probably be a good movie the second dude will be fire the first new movie
data/029739.wav|guy behind me i was playing amsa
data/008288.wav|we have in your pc do you delete stuff i don't really i have a lot of storage it will eventually fill up and then i will have to mass delete many important things that i should look closely at but i won't
data/032140.wav|his residency we don't have the money a
data/019871.wav|and has a ton of players and a ton of money so they have a ton of developers working around the clock
data/011064.wav|okay yeah i'm sorry i'll give it a little more time mix messages
data/031285.wav|the skywalk and he realizes he
data/021058.wav|the ship your pants too i can't wait to ship my
data/007235.wav|oh no it's not no it's just it's merch it's
data/026461.wav|intelligent for the modern times you know you could
data/024900.wav|into to use to make smart choices but we hate using it and one of the ways to ensure we always use system 1 is to put us
data/009391.wav|out of it double lift maybe
data/007423.wav|it was trying to act out of that knockout
data/027581.wav|if the text and sells ads on it and it
data/019166.wav|so this is a better ad but
data/010490.wav|one or something and if you haven't watched that one then you you have to watch that first and then you could say it's not for you that's fine
data/026394.wav|know that it's the new one which which again
data/016437.wav|in the final l to a person who i consider one of the closest i found to
data/018864.wav|starting on the product boys this
data/026528.wav|as you expect me to go yeah
data/029073.wav|they strapped with one of these

data/010629.wav|the jungler this is the red buff
data/019617.wav|pissed off canada canada is after me i
data/002365.wav|it's equally important that i sort of knock you down a peg
data/007248.wav|well i think it would have been i think i i think
data/015070.wav|watch it online they didn't think it mattered turns out it did matter and allowed netflix to go really quickly so right now netflix
data/019762.wav|it'll be unique for each game but uh
data/015019.wav|but the netflix that you're thinking of not this
data/018884.wav|from reality and the dog is memorable because it's so
data/031954.wav|with the scar have i ever watched it on stream
data/025215.wav|put that behind you and move on well this
data/015983.wav|trying to do uber loses money and netflix is trying to do
data/024674.wav|what we're hoping for to keep the gravy train rolling is for china to step in and
data/003308.wav|it's not the official definition or the way
data/009220.wav|pretty well you need a lot of that uh sid
data/031155.wav|like i i oh my god i'm so like you look
data/020726.wav|in the month of this post
data/026780.wav|a high stock value generally makes it easier to raise money to take on debt at favorable terms and the momentum having a rising stock price also attracts talent for cheaper
data/018729.wav|it depends very much on sony's price if they can price close to
data/017465.wav|was that a lot of internet users
data/019334.wav|people who want like an expensive laptop for flights the workhorse market people who use laptops every single day and then the
data/003688.wav|and then enforce it and right there from then
data/020711.wav|round of award winners are still doing let's check back in one more time on
data/014712.wav|mr church for everyone to hear
data/006843.wav|big deal kind of like a tony hawk
data/026043.wav|cause of the scale of amazon basically anyone
data/022317.wav|the voice we knew we had to go uber big on all taco
data/004962.wav|i mean he's been incredibly stupid and that's not the only thing going on
data/020386.wav|on the joke and they fit
data/012862.wav|and i started doing more classes and stuff
data/003579.wav|and and like i said i mean again in the short term a recession is awful it's just there's
data/029864.wav|hours and he wouldn't let you leave
data/021215.wav|on this and that is why if disney had just stuck
data/027538.wav|prep disaster just years of uh
data/009630.wav|practicing i did the year to
data/018121.wav|you brought it home and it was this
data/028982.wav|would you have felt better if you just
data/026841.wav|i get i'm using the patented system that i developed last year to accurately rank all ads actually great for ads that were
data/021860.wav|can you draw your own conclusions just weird that like most of this seemed to happen after i joined and started shaking things up you know if you are too focused on
data/029631.wav|it's going to end on a high note with pp and apex
data/006029.wav|waxed him literally me who was

data/027941.wav|what they post you can follow me on there you can follow cody co or scott galloway or
data/002159.wav|instead of the real sky i
data/021389.wav|was the amount of shorts gamestop was a company that was right around here okay between 20 and
data/026936.wav|wanting nothing like that but uh it it
data/028603.wav|i thought i made the whole thing up they got super
data/014793.wav|i think yeah yeah i need to move this over here i think

data/024975.wav|kept on one it got so many negative posts that it was ranked as one of the most hated brands so
data/014892.wav|the competition and they're they're making
data/018908.wav|do people to really understand the zoomer mind who could market
data/004252.wav|are still much unrest but it is not um
data/010415.wav|three choices but they're all terrible i know but i looked at the internet speeds in
data/031252.wav|and i get there and of course it's closed of course it's
data/008104.wav|it was powerful i feel like i really
data/028305.wav|more details you didn't answer anything
data/027118.wav|then right around the pandemic it spiked at a
data/030818.wav|it's not that weak it was a normal apple
data/000719.wav|but i've been watching like he's seen
data/019003.wav|what about whether whether or not it truly is working but from
data/011227.wav|she asked me what he asked me what i think pog is that's ridiculous

data/007970.wav|and marketing money it's a full complete
data/015209.wav|pretty big challenge that could threaten their company in this case
data/020357.wav|in the back of the car
data/025113.wav|baby formula stuff where they were like tricking mothers
data/022605.wav|oh yeah it's pretty good i think that's pretty good i think

data/003788.wav|it's just it's like it's so comical it's
data/002878.wav|that negatively massively impacts the revenues or he needs to figure out
data/019958.wav|the big big big hits okay movies that did hundreds of millions
data/003205.wav|for the reporting and they fail for what actually happened about the game actually infinity i dunno if you guys have heard of this game it's basically a for the reporting and a fail for what actually happened about the game axi infinity i
data/031885.wav|how many of you raised your hand
data/020743.wav|i looked at a lot of ads

data/027549.wav|with the nine percent and their first step to stopping him the ceo had a pretty smart
data/012533.wav|they gave me something but god
data/006985.wav|monday on a tuesday we got a bunch of stuff dude we got a bunch of
data/025664.wav|craziest shock value type commercials that have ever been aired be sure to find a study buddy to keep you safe and protected let's walk through
data/020693.wav|i don't know the fifth award the award for the worst ad that
data/003315.wav|and we are not headed for negative
data/021158.wav|it's a pretty much a win on all fronts
data/006041.wav|you he abuses australian privilege i will say that and i've i've never said this before because australians have wide
data/006250.wav|well that's interesting i guess yeah i remember
data/001315.wav|the videos yeah and it's like i didn't know that i
data/022846.wav|is unbeatable now they have this great platform they
data/007398.wav|but i think because of the way when they had
data/011502.wav|in stories and it was it
data/008203.wav|and i said skip the 40 mil
data/014875.wav|of the console wars i want to say with every week that passes i am more and more impressed with the
data/018969.wav|the switch back and forth it's
data/011302.wav|i just wouldn't open discord i
data/027898.wav|well the good news is that i'm probably gonna
data/031083.wav|like all that stuff but he also knew what stuff to
data/027289.wav|get to the difficulty because when you think
data/013447.wav|dan the man you at the crib no response really
data/014174.wav|wide range of connection and they went
data/026069.wav|was by far the most successful movie of 2021
data/018199.wav|in discovered in market research and knew
data/019561.wav|oh my god this is the most divisive one of all i'm actually liking
data/002370.wav|i'm sure you will have extra
data/011261.wav|when you said you were gonna
data/006427.wav|at the upgrade your town hall to the next level
data/004412.wav|maybe i do a quick check here scrub
data/011186.wav|is a bartender so like not saying that we do anything illegal but like
data/010678.wav|no cursing limits how hard could the boss possibly be
data/008254.wav|we can talk about you know all stuff
data/011680.wav|there is no worse more annoying nerd than the
data/027071.wav|you just sort of like everyone just
data/021527.wav|working together and pointing together to attack
data/012244.wav|way to put you in the brig
data/009788.wav|the only problem is that i
data/021876.wav|okay this is a real text that he sent this woman this you might think it's photoshop this
data/025146.wav|it's like i guess they paid for ludicrous as well and they're
data/018537.wav|they're not worried about making extra money by selling a few more copies of
data/017640.wav|at the time about shifting your money from here to
data/017856.wav|melodic was i'm just think a lot of i'm just saying a lot of
data/023383.wav|as esports grows will any video game providers provide players with modern sports also level contracts yes esports will eventually have contracts as big as real sports now do i think that anyone will ever make that much money playing
data/007170.wav|a lot of people jesus was
data/029325.wav|because i had gone to worlds and bought the merch so i'm wearing like a
data/022070.wav|i was so obsessed with twitch and watching esports that my real account and the twitch account were almost indistinguishable so i would tweet like
data/026381.wav|a walking advertisement for their brand
data/026107.wav|against kellogg's had great success what i was impressed about the kellogg strike is not only the strikers standing up for
data/002236.wav|as some dumb stuff about like two-ply
data/011758.wav|it's we flew from california and they were
data/000411.wav|it's not a game of any skill it is a coin flip
data/010340.wav|it's no one's like it's not a bombshell if nvidia
data/009334.wav|think size two servings per container so that means that i get to have
data/007074.wav|eight months right so i'm just you know you gotta take the
data/009125.wav|if we get me jeff bezos
data/028578.wav|it was like an hour or your
data/031924.wav|i'm not a big believer in like public displays of affection and
data/024513.wav|i need to give you money to do app store
data/030348.wav|san francisco later and we sort of
data/001232.wav|that is that is all of my outbound messages to them i say hey can i just get more of the smoothies but i'll
data/009465.wav|i just say play safer it would have
data/012885.wav|in that respect it's still the degrees can be valuable but
data/019881.wav|not just bad games but like over like it's these are it's funny it's like the perfect storm is a publisher with a huge marketing budget and a mediocre to bad game number three number three anyway this is my number one but it's number three on my list okay
data/010577.wav|open the door and let him out he wants to
data/023578.wav|was tickets from the movie theater and giving them to you it was an amazing deal and that's why they were able to attract a ton of customers in no time they did they did almost no marketing but of course that
data/027176.wav|in kick the can the clock
data/023167.wav|shoe polish yeah they'll just basically paint shoe polish onto the line the grill marks to make them pop so basically when you see a food a
data/019848.wav|and this one's a doozy this one
data/021436.wav|i never believed in this even though i i truly support the general idea of you know
data/024091.wav|it actually cuts times in half for the same quality of food pretty pog which
data/018005.wav|six months rookie five wait i have to start laughing like
data/006816.wav|right here on stream you can
data/031819.wav|all his friends are sitting together at
data/026257.wav|was accomplished in the past decade and a half if you
data/007354.wav|if the the sheik that didn't hate playing chic
data/016891.wav|but it still massive it's just still
data/025070.wav|if you don't know what nestle makes it's pretty
data/020211.wav|with your meal for 10 times the price
data/015531.wav|so if this keeps you in there
data/003719.wav|well the selection and it says a midweek sales but it's not it's not this is actually a
data/002828.wav|it's possible because while they're in this ongoing legal battle it is
data/003932.wav|who took a massive chunk of the votes by
data/016949.wav|we can follow me on that app and see what i'm investing in you can follow many other
data/006660.wav|the low point i was so miserable i
data/026234.wav|things more than they think they can afford and their paycheck comes around and then all of a sudden they are on the hook
data/028626.wav|i have not played i'm super rusty the
data/022878.wav|it's between a trillion dollar company and a multi-billion dollar company
data/015536.wav|when they're in the system but it doesn't have the same impact or ruthlessness when the in the system but it doesn't have the same
data/023384.wav|or something no i don't because those nobody wants to watch
data/007946.wav|is what makes it all worthwhile and
data/028113.wav|with the about face clan now
data/024103.wav|we attract another bad boy halo viewing finally you can quit that side thing with nvidia if i get
data/020599.wav|growing up to the door right now who could it be yes it's
data/028891.wav|with her this is all secondhand story so again
data/021017.wav|it was terrible no one liked it if they
data/006246.wav|what's good what's good how's everybody doing do you guys have work or school tomorrow like thursday and friday is it an nvidia only holiday
data/012214.wav|work get to go to this final table later that day
data/032206.wav|in around and we see some nice watches and we were just walking around this watch store being
data/006166.wav|well the money was great meeting you i was too scared to make a gh joke la
data/014670.wav|it's settled here i have to make sure everything's set up
data/028699.wav|i think people i met a lot of people
data/020208.wav|brands are afraid they don't want to get roasted
data/028818.wav|for me was like i died
data/006430.wav|well rune chains and your prospects of a successful run and great loot have never been better all members
data/013220.wav|we met one time in person and you called me a racist
data/002410.wav|thank you for the tier one i think one of the most inconvenient parts about
data/024733.wav|it's topic the psychological warfare of gotcha games and the tricks they used a parent you from your money and how they're being adopted as the it's the topic the psychological warfare of gotcha games and the tricks they use to
data/017578.wav|what back to the marketing model of like the 60s of the
data/025306.wav|we watch a little bit it doesn't matter it's it's my bill i pay that bill because i'm a melee fan it's like union
data/007177.wav|is doing and as you get better it's going to be a problem for for established people and i said if
data/024463.wav|in mind to talk about hearty
data/009619.wav|it's going on mr beast has ludwig's
data/021885.wav|it's husband and you gotta think i i feel bad for this guy no these are all true
data/025131.wav|also i'm not even kidding like i actually think
data/029315.wav|if the fan of league of
data/023635.wav|yeah i mean this is an extreme dark example but i could talk a little bit about pride as a post concept it it um from brands and from government
data/007227.wav|he wants to get sponsored he's
data/023808.wav|what are you doing in the dark
data/016293.wav|the lord and talking about how developers
data/019788.wav|it really good they don't look like this so okay we're adding this to the list
data/023743.wav|we want to join in if you want to help support
data/029319.wav|for what this is like i'm like a
data/020372.wav|overly reading into it i don't think people are like making something up but there's like a
data/030191.wav|grabbing each other's shirt like if
data/018721.wav|they can afford to lose everything on this console to make it back by becoming the netflix of gaming sony
data/015117.wav|how to make our own content quickly or we're going to be at the mercy of them forever and
data/015443.wav|these biggest hits do star wars uh marvel
data/031620.wav|that's that's how we did it and that was
data/009819.wav|a nuclear so it's going to be harder to switch to electric heating
data/019093.wav|i think they're not solving the same problem they're still human beings they
data/009138.wav|if the fanboys that i said a mild scent
data/029957.wav|i think you saw no he didn't raid i think
data/002947.wav|that it was over but basically there wasn't
data/000716.wav|and when i first heard you were killing
data/031874.wav|these three things you could just see it had a massive impact and then if you talk about these it's like
data/028203.wav|i get a lot of viewers on twitch
data/006937.wav|imagine everything i'm saying right now there's
data/011646.wav|caribbean cruise do you know what i'm saying you can get like for
data/007586.wav|go to more melee stuff this year as it opens up and uh i'm excited
data/027692.wav|you can get elected as a
data/029178.wav|it was annoying watching them not get through it for so long but it would have been such a moment it
data/013131.wav|the nintendo direct all i saw was strikers uh battle
data/002965.wav|i got their sierra 6 lunchbox
data/010621.wav|he's actual gamer but he actually proved it
data/003712.wav|when they just make their own version amazon
data/024705.wav|or valueless owning a bunch of
data/024604.wav|i'm gonna go to a marketing conference
data/025570.wav|we're going to have cool keyboards
data/018736.wav|either the nine or the ten or the x or i forget which one it was but they made it cost a thousand dollars and they
data/016244.wav|on twitter who did some uh
data/022096.wav|we had a pretty large group he wrote i only tip god
data/006152.wav|off stream yesterday before the smite two crowns two crowns back to back easy
data/026282.wav|if the three major sections on the clock
data/031416.wav|six going out there to play some bocce ball
data/001053.wav|see that i've gotten away from my dota roots those were the days we would just get on and we'd play morning to night dota and everyone in
data/003824.wav|at the to sort of it's happened in a lot of industries
data/032163.wav|and instantly it is gone here's the thing
data/011140.wav|say nice things i said really i
data/010064.wav|through any traditional method of learning but through consuming youtube content they are able to get a little bit of a drip of new knowledge into their brain and so we have developed get smarter
data/006889.wav|if you want gatorade or powerade or
data/006075.wav|in catalog that's worth hundreds of
data/002729.wav|cost money on the deal okay he needs to lose right now otherwise my
data/026940.wav|in the craziest market it's ever been in like the past 20 years these are real
data/008721.wav|what there's a legal term for it it's like
data/008455.wav|we'll think about young enough soccer i mean if you're like little league age they can't make it to the goal goalie or not
data/005079.wav|so we are going to look at the funniest and best tweets of the summer which i have compiled here
data/007216.wav|we're all good day three he makes top eight okay unheard of
data/020927.wav|it's change so what i would say
data/017581.wav|for example nike is a is

data/014022.wav|if the with the main event we're gonna talk about
data/027333.wav|mad at them for using summons or magic because they need to reduce the amount of people that that qualify as real fans this is an actual psychological need because the scarcity

data/027269.wav|we don't do tv advertising there's no like
data/021075.wav|very rare in an ad yeah it's good it also you
data/001772.wav|that's just how it works every every 15 to

data/026214.wav|and apparently this type of payment system is extremely popular
data/004937.wav|he pays which is why i sold while
data/027217.wav|or brand and the one that's being debated most often but a couple
data/028616.wav|you can't get diamond i was like dude i
data/004679.wav|i want like let's say let's say
data/000003.wav|big a chug so many red bulls

data/009275.wav|harder balloons boss i think it's gone i wanted
data/011115.wav|and i'm hoping i'm taking all the right points into consideration they bring a lot of great things to our friendship but they don't reciprocate the trust i have which is something i really want in a relationship i don't think i'm mentally strong enough to keep a best friend as just a friend so i
data/028174.wav|it all comes back this guy with 7
data/031412.wav|we got out but it was refreshing was there any shrinkage first of all even if there was
data/012115.wav|and we're like miss timing it
data/023587.wav|the greatest and only marketing show on twitch and youtube last week
data/025087.wav|well cheated by the education they receive and their ability to get a job after graduation they feel like they've been scammed out of their money and
data/025855.wav|for like they gave me like 500
data/028247.wav|if the think they're looking right into my soul like insanely into my soul and i was like whoa but that's a good thing
data/025977.wav|this to me more than anything else looks like the end of blizzard
data/012117.wav|so he's like what's going on over here
data/014909.wav|i wonder if it's an out of court
data/009480.wav|team and they're going to get ahead and then give
data/000465.wav|where he worked at twitch and riot and all these places and and uh we're doing
data/030343.wav|i was at a party with with women at it
data/009308.wav|what about removing credit card payments
data/005742.wav|if the the smart but here's the butt
data/017874.wav|i thought about marketing and internet providers comcast comes to mind because the major monopoly the thing about marketing for internet providers they don't have to they do it for like brand sentiment reasons but in general they are
data/008337.wav|i can't like let down but i did want to go to
data/020789.wav|in those moments we felt like it was over and then we did what no one thought
data/018118.wav|you are witnessing greatness you can
data/020630.wav|in this ad at one point a tweet ratioed them that
data/009164.wav|ten before it that's what it means
data/022726.wav|it was like before our windows phones anyway
data/009692.wav|and yet he still didn't have it as hard as an average twitch streamer who has to have far worse psychologically
data/023437.wav|welcome to marketing monday today's topic the three lines theory of marketing let me give you some background let me give you some context three weeks ago i decided to expand my professional career and so i signed up for what is known as a brand strategy sprint a
data/018440.wav|is the winner for life now i haven't seen
data/025188.wav|that is what we should base our entire brand on the world should know about
data/001408.wav|why did you join the discord
data/013853.wav|make a tweet being like uh
data/009225.wav|my friend's house and chipped my tooth and
data/029821.wav|the seventh place chat of kings
data/027259.wav|well that ubisoft might take from selling items this also was a great example someone said if ubisoft designed the
data/022624.wav|and i was like i can do it i mean i i generally have an angry gamer and what's funny is none and i was like well i can do it i mean i i generally am an angry gamer
data/028705.wav|league of legends is having its first major stadium filling tournament in the west staples center sold out league of legends world championships season three faker goes on
data/020614.wav|oh my god we were all
data/027099.wav|is like a walking corpse i get it but let's plot some of the things
data/003646.wav|the good parts and there are good parts of capitalism work and
data/018143.wav|there's a dead was that a dead woman
data/024052.wav|the question being what is only fans and in fact their site traffic their site traffic is now at all time highs during a time when overall internet traffic is down like point five percent
data/002216.wav|we're going to go to employee questions
data/004882.wav|certain that it's an absolutely fair breakdown but it does seem from all that i'm seeing through the past few months is that he he continues to
data/006686.wav|alliance handshake handshake okay he's going i might even
data/031679.wav|is that event and now years later i can feed in league
data/027401.wav|we are they are not hitting the mainstream of
data/021443.wav|yeah dude more power to you but if you do need the money if you think oh this is how i'm
data/012262.wav|it's cool bar area and they have a legitimate
data/016231.wav|it is crazy that we just found a 12 view
data/017047.wav|well as that's what they're going to be
data/015094.wav|our stuff and we're going to put it online ourselves luckily making your own streaming
data/004474.wav|and then i'll get on my scooter and
data/022968.wav|it's multiple years if ever and because of the documents that was leaked we actually found out
data/000018.wav|with stealthy by the way like anyone it was
data/012498.wav|if you want to be honest
data/014629.wav|as but youtube is pretty good
data/010353.wav|in what way does that sound like your first grade birthday how does me gaslighting lyric with three characters playing fall guys sound anything like your first grade birthday a ghost
data/024518.wav|of those got struck down unfortunately the main claim that the judge made i read
data/001484.wav|i've always seen you in chat but i never really know how to say it
data/025878.wav|and again in a different environment had this been the one slip up and the community trusted blizzard this one moment probably
data/026464.wav|hope you learned a little thing or two about way to think about marketing through the clock model and that was that was a
data/008243.wav|he is the person that hired me at
data/026775.wav|how should someone get into stocks
data/000919.wav|was on i call them goggles
data/027410.wav|and then submit it would be a
data/028807.wav|don't worry she was like pitying me dude
data/004471.wav|beans yeah black beans and then i usually double up the chicken sign a
data/002323.wav|we have a guest and so i'm
data/010861.wav|but you know that's that's not necessarily the
data/027377.wav|in the other way and don't understand and then steal everything they can you could post anything you could post any copyrighted music copyrighted
data/030630.wav|all grades and i was like i
data/003223.wav|and what's actually really funny is that it is proven to be a ponzi scheme even in
data/009881.wav|at for dollars dollars go way farther in europe than they ever have so
data/001013.wav|they're delicious and nutritious she says and if
data/029980.wav|was for sure you were number one
data/030134.wav|two weeks until he gave up on it i had to play hey you pikachu against my will like
data/019014.wav|is astronomically expensive but if you own the
data/018576.wav|whoever wins the generation where we go to the cloud is the permanent winner okay because
data/030815.wav|third thing don't say weak apple bite
data/006600.wav|we're looking forward to number three
data/019136.wav|outdoor advertising you know it's a lot
data/019760.wav|now from a marketing pov let's go into a
data/007182.wav|i sick because i i again you guys
data/020968.wav|that i'm subscribed to most of the articles they put out
data/015036.wav|who had this no late fees remember that the the blockbuster killer i wonder
data/021874.wav|which probably include that because you know how to spit game i love you alive girl i will show you with my body and my lips and my eyes
data/025894.wav|if the the court most people in my experience don't give much amount of weight to your words they don't every time something
data/006039.wav|yeah yeah i don't want you to use the
data/006109.wav|this is the context this is the
data/007588.wav|now but i'm also down to do the reddit
data/016115.wav|i want to be animated but i'm i'm dead i'm tired
data/019769.wav|is illusory it's not real it's not gonna
data/006613.wav|we're getting monday if i was more active at the time i don't think i streamed
data/015772.wav|part of legacy contracts from back before hulu was owned by disney but hulu is not a winner of
data/013293.wav|i that's not how it works do not
data/026955.wav|that people are actually having i'm gonna
data/005716.wav|about whether or not hassan is a weeb
data/019927.wav|the time especially because it's one of the very first it's the first time we fell for the great
data/031228.wav|and a side story of my life starts to converge that side story is i've started to get into esports this is
data/014714.wav|are coming with the heat today appreciate that
data/001044.wav|so that's weird that you didn't what you're in that text
data/025134.wav|most people they see that they go oh that's so sad and then they they change the channel okay so not very effective and i feel
data/001166.wav|and i use a service called sprig but i
data/024688.wav|and they ah they have to walk away
data/021451.wav|people were saying wow it's more valuable than apple stock
data/031299.wav|little parched and i'm like alright while everyone else is a little parched and i'm like all right
data/021589.wav|i was going up and the second
data/005631.wav|it literally the first thing he says to me was some like
data/025161.wav|it's all they had to do i graduated college this is
data/013260.wav|i can't reveal it all i can say is you know what if
data/012817.wav|is the biggest league tournament in the
data/012605.wav|i tell you this the reason i think buying
data/024981.wav|would think you're the world's biggest douche
data/006927.wav|my first monthly shower do you only wear a hat when you haven't showered it's my biggest reason for wearing a hat is because usually i'll go to the gym around lunchtime and i'll get
data/021410.wav|that's the gamma squeeze okay that's that
data/030480.wav|or propose right at the beginning of dinner
data/011424.wav|in and then even then it might be so like keep it up
data/020667.wav|wow today i am honored to present the award for esports marketing of the year which i'm sure will go to
data/023892.wav|this tournament if it had been bad
data/001097.wav|in college sophomore junior senior was a little bit more focused on the grind
data/013959.wav|to miss payments will cut you off so it's dead on training wheels you'll still have to pay
data/016283.wav|and they had to work overtime for a year and they had the exact same promise last night
data/029029.wav|but we both liked the same girl and it
data/000052.wav|whereas i guess we'll get to that i'm assuming no marketing money this week are you kidding me are you kidding me of course i worked on marketing monday
data/009678.wav|more miserable and have less income absolutely not
data/014538.wav|it's the end of my my um
data/006793.wav|we were all watching the game or watching um
data/002627.wav|perhaps it is opposite day perhaps perhaps and this is a big perhaps
data/020007.wav|it's the for for decades now the amount of money
data/024244.wav|where it's like they want to associate microsoft with technology for the betterment of humanity i thought it was
data/028843.wav|the nap room but it was like a terrible
data/022523.wav|let's actually cover this right now i think the mark of a good april
data/015637.wav|i literally think stans might be their
data/028129.wav|they're like roundabout way using spax to go
data/003754.wav|well there's no it's not illegal it's totally legal and so uh
data/017599.wav|and they've over invested in these two areas and it
data/004808.wav|are things that it's a material breach of contract
data/018730.wav|at the same in fact being slightly
data/020273.wav|i'm pretty sure this this came out in the summer
data/024481.wav|the the whole concept is terrible and i swear to god for for food companies especially fast food companies it's not
data/027632.wav|man in the world he can afford it he's got
data/023125.wav|because they don't want you to find out that it's basically all the same thing and you know it's unhealthy for you this one is an intriguing example that i
data/007023.wav|well made he got the z trigger i mean everything's
data/002713.wav|or do you do you keep going
data/031180.wav|it's really it's really cool it's
data/010244.wav|certain things but surprisingly some things don't
data/016385.wav|and then they blame things like the paychecks to every person the the
data/031532.wav|moving your soldiers around and fighting and dodging and weaving and half the game is building the army he was so good at both but he's amazing at building the army but in this game
data/017896.wav|and i can't get out now what is your emergency
data/023582.wav|well that movie came out whenever fallout came out
data/003532.wav|that would be unadvised cars are very
data/009987.wav|hell yeah you know what team novak
data/018418.wav|you guys maybe have stadia that
data/003951.wav|if they could somehow split the duties duties between charlie and lud i think of i i think those guys could do it i think a charlie lud ticket again it's not going to be good the day what their if they could somehow split the duties duties between charlie and lud i think if i i think those guys could do it i think a charlie lud ticket again it's not gonna be good
data/012288.wav|well he's like being the lando kind of thing
data/032101.wav|the that to be a punchline
data/019305.wav|the deck we made for this marketing project and he's like yeah
data/003997.wav|it's a very busy lately with the nvidia stuff but i
data/021661.wav|you could win a million dollars
data/002426.wav|oh and then i bought through the third party store website and they just didn't but
data/021761.wav|there's a lot of things wrong with this whenever you put them in the exact same costumes and set as they were when they were like
data/011619.wav|the honeymoon and i sort of looked around at different options and i thought of the fact that ari well first
data/021981.wav|to get her to say these lines like amazon is great and to get slightly personal here which i don't usually want to do on stream my father who works 30 years in the military
data/016379.wav|like potbelly and applebee's and big
data/004967.wav|be related to my biological father in any way shape or form i don't know by the way every single one of these things so like the
data/029736.wav|they will people but by the way
data/013120.wav|at indian food for dinner it was really
data/003747.wav|do that and companies don't want
data/016276.wav|if there is one thing we love it's promises we don't care if
data/029441.wav|yo thank you g and then
data/000657.wav|isnt even like we lost a lot of raw money but a lot of it
data/001693.wav|i don't really remember any of the perverted stuff increased volaka you got it
data/021835.wav|the way i structured this is i pulled out like i think three things that i think are actual lessons that i might use and i figure if i might use them in my real life you might find benefit
data/026954.wav|we'll clean ad that that really pitches their
data/018332.wav|there's a company about to go public
data/007152.wav|i know there's a lot of different opinions on it
data/028109.wav|if segment where i do a deeper dive this was
data/002394.wav|and then i'll go to work do work and then
data/023656.wav|is that i hadn't seen before so i liked it a
data/027191.wav|we hired uh coder at fromsoft
data/000099.wav|i see it will be a blessed it'll be it'll be a
data/026570.wav|i am threatening you in case
data/025235.wav|and video games outside of three hours a week one hour on friday
data/028301.wav|up and also but even on like business stuff
data/030113.wav|nothing happens hey you pikachu he looks up
data/001161.wav|like it's actually good uh it it's like
data/003172.wav|books lunch not only as it destroyed facebook watch time and times spent on facebook but it's starting to eat on instagram now in fact books lunch not only as it destroyed facebook watch time and and time spent on facebook but it's starting to eat on
data/002913.wav|the subscriber count is by finally cracking down on password sharing but password sharing has been so prevalent for so long and again just a few years ago they tweeted love is sharing a password i mean netflix's strategy has changed
data/023820.wav|we in terms of like consistently funny ads best of all time absolutely goated i i really
data/000380.wav|saturday night's one of the best nights
data/003736.wav|in the united citizens united was a very terrible terrible supreme court ruling i believe that basically said that corporations are people too and
data/028081.wav|so actually their first solution was to partner with motorola and they
data/027765.wav|unfortunately every one of those seven
data/016266.wav|so anthony davis was only used for one
data/028138.wav|unfortunately none of it turned out to be true so now they had to release a financial
data/015063.wav|which is nothing that's nothing that's like mr
data/019773.wav|the games of all time starting with number
data/001647.wav|he's got his cat in a santa hat oh can i
data/028228.wav|as people so we got which is by the way
data/023162.wav|basically nearly raw but if it's if it's raw how does it look grilled how do they get these grill lines like look at those beautiful sultry grill lines god damn you know like sheesh you
data/006698.wav|because i didn't turn off the alerts or the title for the entire
data/021127.wav|and i mean if it was like on purpose like man let's make it so cringy people talk
data/011054.wav|sphinx what did this friend do we are all
data/029843.wav|if the the tournament is like let's all watch
data/021490.wav|if i'm borrowing the shares from you and i'm going to sell
data/015843.wav|cause that's where all the other esports are but i don't think you'd go to like hulu to watch it
data/012998.wav|math month sounds hell but if you're someone that struggles with math instead
data/005861.wav|i can't say but that was the main takeaways yeah that was the main takeaways
data/024024.wav|what they were trying to do was publicly announce that you know the extreme end of the pornography will not be tolerated so they could
data/003435.wav|once he secures it and he's locked in
data/011059.wav|so it's like i couldn't i
data/007876.wav|in the worry because i put out 3 000
data/006945.wav|i take time and take stock of your life you know and it's like when i was
data/019012.wav|wasn't followers on instagram to do
data/003402.wav|what it feels like it just it's not going to be
data/021871.wav|intermission here because i was like wow jeff bezos you
data/006637.wav|it was down 30. it was like okay this would be
data/020068.wav|we could get made irrelevant now number two is of course the louisiana purchase how could i not
data/023703.wav|around the world the united states navy has the ability to take you around the world allow you to play pokemon go help you achieve the goal of being a pokemon master come talk to your local navy recruiter
data/030116.wav|we find out very quickly the tech almost
data/016621.wav|next this one is just kind of
data/010901.wav|i don't get everything ready right
data/005739.wav|he knows what he's doing i think he's got a real plan
data/004825.wav|from this population problem back back around
data/026084.wav|this isn't like a joke they just think that's me so not only did i get forgotten by
data/003619.wav|sorry that you have to live with him
data/019302.wav|at the group project i haven't spoken to him in probably
data/016875.wav|the average adult or child in your case is watching extremely a lot more digital media
data/007802.wav|well with my picture is jake hurwitz saying cheeky streamer
data/027073.wav|they'd show a cute animal climbing down to the forest floor to eat a dorito and then
data/024681.wav|in the way down it is not going to the moon and i would encourage you to not buy the dip but again every time i say that it goes up one dollar and someone goes you idiot if i had bought it at
data/002764.wav|i do have some wins and fails to go through
data/001806.wav|i think the beginning was the best part he had some good questions
data/028004.wav|seem a little bit worse for the xbox side combo that with a dub on the sony side which just announced their new ps plus lineup
data/015836.wav|that's not a joke the average viewer
data/008540.wav|we're likely is that they want to return things to how they were before elon musk started talking about twitter they're
data/025352.wav|and i was there they're like yeah let's do it so i get pulled in and it was
data/027890.wav|if you have to pay online are almost equaling
data/025634.wav|hey everyone chill out this is an important
data/031405.wav|so i didn't get a video we had a video of stan's jumping after me but you can
data/014409.wav|if you want to watch a twitch
data/006799.wav|i wasn't there to give him a comforting
data/022166.wav|that i find a little more distasteful is an ad i saw from subaru if you guys know what it is or maybe you can find it basically it's about a child getting into a car crash and the mom
data/021094.wav|just like we do and this is the white and gold dress that caused the civil war but most amazing of all are the avocados
data/025111.wav|why researcher this is a campaign by nestle because they've gotten some hot water
data/018528.wav|i come out on any other pass service
data/030123.wav|when you speak that bubble goes to him and if he gives you a question mark he didn't understand it now everything i was saying to pikachu
data/006294.wav|stream idea let your dad cut your hair that's a terrible
data/025338.wav|i got four thousand retweets instead then
data/012961.wav|it out like a really bad economy people that graduated during a recession
data/028812.wav|so so i lied but it worked out because i
data/013630.wav|i can't call it streaming wars in the day after
data/023064.wav|well food marketing is actually really really interesting and for one particular reason to me money that's why i'm interested in food marketing there's a lot more of it in food than in almost any other field of marketing and you're probably wondering why you're thinking
data/006876.wav|we just expenses to twitch early twitch had the
data/030552.wav|you know i want to ask her to marry me and
data/031346.wav|obviously double down if i'm in for a
data/009326.wav|i feel like unless you mean like switch style even still i think zero shot but
data/023240.wav|finally i can have my my cake and eat it too it's
data/002693.wav|the table i have to legally tell you there's no penalty but if you'd like to walk away just giving you that option we're
data/016182.wav|as success you gotta invest in success you
data/001340.wav|yeah i built it strong into code but probably
data/006464.wav|and that fail is um how do i say this okay when you look
data/024715.wav|it'd be ethical i'll get rid of all my stocks
data/001923.wav|like the team is great the work i'm doing is fun
data/023044.wav|and they sued and they lost that lawsuit eventually uh the the
data/017862.wav|is not infrequent there's infrequent updates the developers don't give you
data/002985.wav|while the plot no it's not there's more left
data/031894.wav|a friend of mine pulls me aside and he's
data/023937.wav|ladies and gentlemen of the jury this is about much more
data/011146.wav|see a real nft because it's not in the
data/020896.wav|so they were wrong you can find articles from 10 years ago
data/007960.wav|the some graphs and charts thank you to my new
data/000828.wav|if you're not you should be i mean dermis the
data/008768.wav|it doesn't seem to hold up and all the articles that i've read
data/004182.wav|shall we could do any other time and then he's like yeah talk to my assistant and then i
data/016867.wav|it's really it's something you can't even predict
data/021847.wav|in the first amazon office attempting to become a twitch streamer but he was a
data/014882.wav|it's better for players or creators they're
data/012486.wav|like all the characters i had completely been ignoring and
data/023322.wav|and if you don't want to hear me that's fine but the numbers will out over time you have a safe moon story
data/017886.wav|much hype but it's actually less and less important as
data/016093.wav|right here is just a few of their episodes
data/002652.wav|which was like a month ago thank you ceo of
data/004616.wav|i think i just ignored that one you're telling me elon musk
data/020261.wav|all ads you have to feature the product this is true of all ads every out of you have to say it but it's
data/015974.wav|a lot of debt over on their
data/016580.wav|if he's he's making a mint right now and
data/008925.wav|i forgot your name so it's
data/026550.wav|and got a bunch of backlash for it and has
data/022006.wav|and then the idea is that it hits the
data/025991.wav|you're off right with some terrible brand tweets the the
data/001275.wav|maybe you're thinking of sonic the
data/027394.wav|yeah so roblox obviously sensing a pr
data/020182.wav|it's obviously a good roast but the end of the day you don't ever want the word piss and your brand to even be associated
data/006668.wav|in a second it's it bloons is an insane insane game
data/007402.wav|i even though i bought it i just think some people didn't
data/009937.wav|if you know it wasn't that bad this is bullying
data/014524.wav|if likes to quote the great philosophers and he did those riot games as they've always said
data/009974.wav|and i know that you're feeling the heat because your roster
data/030486.wav|but i don't i don't do
data/023367.wav|so many logic like i i went to elementary school
data/022676.wav|image of furry porn marissa mayer ceo of yahoo basically spent
data/026585.wav|literally just call just call if they had called there's no record of it
data/002373.wav|trying to get back on schedule i totally
data/024740.wav|okay so that is an intro video let's get into it this is gaming revenue visualize for the past 20 years
data/003104.wav|let's go sorry youtube streamers yuck you don't work for the number one company
data/023082.wav|as a year on graphics card that's what i would try to capture as a marketer let me compare that to how much the average person spends eating out this is the
data/010447.wav|fewer that doesn't make any sense right we can all agree that doesn't make any sense stupid thing to say
data/028190.wav|the moment with rap respect your elders
data/012073.wav|did it in character he did
data/003145.wav|zuckerberg make instagram instagram again stop trying to be tick-tock i just want to
data/016664.wav|being the one that surprise supplies and build
data/028460.wav|but looking at him now he was like a kid
data/021715.wav|preach corporation preach this is sad who
data/010382.wav|this isn't this is an unsolvable puzzle
data/023029.wav|reduced or removed because a lot of innovation has now been stifled down to a few gigantic corporations basically just rolling in free cash on everyone else's innovations
data/000782.wav|cause i have my plan dude i have my my my um
data/005254.wav|and so okay that's fine and then
data/015640.wav|actually looked into it so to get slightly
data/032285.wav|and they take everything and they just
data/005191.wav|the video because i was wearing a coal cassidy shirt while getting my nails painted that's
data/029350.wav|the reason i need this internship is because i moved to california with no money to try and make a job in esports where at the time has no money
data/010485.wav|okay i stand by that i stand by it i if you didn't know still i'd make fun of you again but it sounds like it's been a few years and
data/027784.wav|im stocks everything is popping and you might be wondering what's going on why is the everything bubble popping why is everything that was doing so good in
data/025559.wav|they immediately had a tractor crash the non-union salaried workers a lot of
data/004624.wav|the a rich superstar like you yeah it's basically all
data/014040.wav|it makes it so feel just makes it feel
data/012264.wav|or area with like a legitimate sabacc
data/019694.wav|i would love to yeah reach out man actually
data/027380.wav|so roblox has done the same thing okay
data/010173.wav|the fans didn't get what they wanted
data/020773.wav|that's me travis scott i'm out nobody defined marketing more in
data/025427.wav|they lag did you see what i see or
data/029583.wav|with all my head but i was like damn if mango thought that that really means it because mango would be the first to
data/014041.wav|feel so much more possible and safe to give youtube
data/003110.wav|in the comments results may be paid for
data/005322.wav|is right and so uh but it was really funny because i was
data/002322.wav|i shaved i just tore off my facial hair
data/022419.wav|what the concept of like don't talk about blah blah blah our
data/003269.wav|if there's an actual win okay because
data/000765.wav|and so we thought okay what if we independently
data/005918.wav|was the one that leaked or would recognize me or would know she was on stage
data/029166.wav|to either a water fire or electric type depending on what stone it's given
data/024007.wav|just to pay out hundreds of millions of dollars to craters every month goes through a few big banks and the big banks are scared of being associated with any illegal activity and the big banks are also run by in general
data/015963.wav|nobody be like oh wait this is stupid let's just call it pc game pass that's hard to do most companies
data/024777.wav|so the next thing they'll do is battle passes battle passes or any kind of format that requires
data/005994.wav|i just really despise it dude and it
data/001817.wav|the problem is visionary doesn't go far enough it's like am i just
data/005299.wav|it's all it's like it is chill
data/031185.wav|i stream as a hobby i have noticed it's hard to even fill every day a few
data/014509.wav|want to go before this when he starts
data/017781.wav|and it would be stupid to
data/010311.wav|i think it'd be harder to get tarik than
data/000372.wav|with nothing to back it up and like
data/031151.wav|in dollars which is absolute flawed he's making
data/008118.wav|oh him off of this so he actually
data/003019.wav|have an entirely the cops had heard reports of a gunshot in a
data/018993.wav|they wasted it and there's so much good that could have been done with that
data/005136.wav|well he does not have any homophobic donations as far as i know
data/023420.wav|yeah i'm not going to say no you're over
data/004567.wav|tweets before then which i'm sure we can
data/005765.wav|i think he's i think he's
data/022584.wav|or environments and games like the last of us remastered are more
data/012025.wav|obviously me a giga chad can
data/013393.wav|when this happens it feels like you get a great sleep on a flight it's awesome i'm not broke don't call me broke
data/030827.wav|am a professional employed adult i don't dignify it with a response usually okay but i just this time it was particularly egregious because i came back with a large
data/017458.wav|sort of putting their physical health at risk to take a stand against a corporation resonated quite
data/012538.wav|so when i would come in and tap it the
data/003157.wav|it as entirely different flow and apple is
data/018398.wav|more specifically amazon luna let me
data/001131.wav|i put this on and pretend i have friends which
data/004856.wav|me listen who hasn't been a billionaire stealing other people's content and then getting into petty twitter
data/025684.wav|as a kid and this is
data/000639.wav|and we go on sunday and man man man man it
data/014737.wav|there is no context everything is just a random bit into another random bit
data/032168.wav|or money so i go to lud who's got a pretty decent
data/013549.wav|i wouldn't congratulate two years carolina
data/018236.wav|the jeep there's so many questions i have so i can pull more than the
data/030598.wav|at the bottom scores i'm banning
data/031640.wav|and i think because i was wearing all the team liquid merch and i said that
data/012735.wav|it all the company might just take your extra labor and pat you on the head but when you work extra hard
data/007844.wav|it was bonehead by naked city no no no no
data/025647.wav|i dunno you guys decide that's a
data/024620.wav|it's fortnite this is the beginning of what people are calling the metaverse the
data/003180.wav|it's coming for everybody's lunch really
data/024724.wav|well everything's new here everything's bigger and newer and different and more
data/006359.wav|like eighty percent of the way there
data/017389.wav|i just wanted to mention it uh you know
data/011883.wav|if moving very slowly so you feel like you're you know like i was impressed with the
data/031823.wav|the fact that i'm finally in variety is
data/029544.wav|meet scar behind like the in the side area behind the stage like
data/014293.wav|i created this chart and this is a this is why this is where the
data/008905.wav|you have to get a document with all the
data/007449.wav|it any more stories but it was just a fun time hanging out celebrating
data/009750.wav|while john travolta is wearing nicholas cage's face
data/003511.wav|get existential dread but i also understand that
data/023386.wav|the the a better version there is no real version of
data/028389.wav|if anyone ever says global or local in my mind i think glocal and i smile i say glocal all the time we
data/028080.wav|we have to get ahead of that and so
data/022050.wav|i'm gonna go through a lot of the ways
data/008199.wav|my favorite minion so end of the day you know you give a little you take a little for me it's all about i i wouldn't take the
data/029782.wav|yeah there's an emotion there but
data/018708.wav|crazy how big microsoft is dude
data/001193.wav|the watch interesting and funny videos and that we learned something from so we can all get a little bit smarter and more importantly
data/032082.wav|the growth is astronomical i haven't seen anything rise so fast and so young
data/016969.wav|it seems pretty good seems pretty good um so i think i will
data/023602.wav|the a better solution than that it's a good start
data/025913.wav|well the fame banned him for life from
data/024021.wav|i think it's pretty well backed up but what i've
data/027208.wav|but after release it began to get some
data/006995.wav|yeah a lot of weird gifts i got a lot of weird gifts
data/022202.wav|i insurance we have fire insurance too that's
data/022510.wav|it was something that was kind of clever but in practice i just feel like they they they lost the plot this
data/003304.wav|seemed to indicate that we were headed for multiple quarters of negative economic growth falling gdp which by the
data/026062.wav|it's been struggling the marvel cinematic universe if anyone needed
data/004076.wav|you like the content you don't got
data/010862.wav|i kinda like my smite champion then
data/000912.wav|to freedom something they can never
data/027367.wav|well that really summed it up for me that it
data/026952.wav|well among average watchers i think in my
data/027983.wav|at big on the blockchain yeah
data/002863.wav|over the difference in the in the in the fall
data/010181.wav|i think so we don't have any narcs so
data/028271.wav|he said current year and what it implied
data/029397.wav|i have embarrassed myself enough today i am not going to turn over to the
data/023177.wav|is what it looks like when i make cereal
data/007824.wav|with the song and to do
data/026093.wav|number two increased social media presence means doing things like going to a party and getting while drunk can severely embarrass you this was a big response from girls on a survey and
data/009410.wav|i say it i know i can't say it i'm not i won't say it i won't say it yeah
data/021821.wav|i want richest man in the world i think he recently re-passed elon musk
data/005351.wav|like doing the head nod and wave
data/030873.wav|i'm excited are you excited i need
data/015660.wav|is he works if they keep executing well if
data/009917.wav|the really understand you can't just be like please
data/029641.wav|what that was like like here
data/026808.wav|zuckerberg in the nuts i mean it's a massive
data/007487.wav|she comes back with apparently there are two items in the menu
data/024471.wav|along but the problem is our brains are
data/027349.wav|called the brand identity model and
data/009204.wav|was one of those games where watching
data/013507.wav|my best friends are ludwig and stans and
data/027593.wav|i think this is a very short-term answer
data/004959.wav|and just go back to being rich
data/018525.wav|one of their biggest advantages sony had was better games they have more consistent lineup of
data/015175.wav|it's going into the next five years okay
data/019335.wav|people who want a cheap laptop just the watch anything this was our presentation we had to give to the whole class and this presentation was very contentious for reasons you will soon see people were not clapping at the end of people who want a cheap laptop just to watch anything this was our presentation we had to give to the whole class and this presentation was very
data/027447.wav|the the the contract and then right before it goes up
data/004776.wav|with the value so far this year you can see the drop in april to now and so all of those loans started to be less secure
data/007668.wav|it's a weird science experiment or something i don't remember paper mario
data/014251.wav|with the i think they just looked at his numbers
data/024729.wav|have you been listening but no
data/002832.wav|well because if he can drag this uh
data/030220.wav|and right yes i mean the goal was to get the end of the course yes actually i don't know
data/026324.wav|remember how i said verizon spends three
data/008845.wav|some insane evidence of of willful fraud on twitter's part over a series of years and they secretly have you know 10x the
data/017226.wav|if there were in poor judgment and
data/020145.wav|right in the middle ground it's funny it stands out
data/004554.wav|right about now is jump into the
data/024367.wav|i close the next ad is more than the
data/009664.wav|and hindsight but what are you gonna
data/010356.wav|my first grade birthday was at a
data/008238.wav|corporate interests and the money required to run
data/019272.wav|literally everything they posted this one you know
data/016897.wav|keeps going up you know what i'm saying if you
data/014981.wav|i mean for some of these guys can
data/019930.wav|give us everything we wanted and it
data/031846.wav|that's crazy this is where ninja like was born this
data/027858.wav|i think bitcoin went under 30k today
data/023593.wav|of oil into the gulf of mexico which is a fire dunk and a fire
data/017363.wav|the live plug with a penny the girl asked
data/000413.wav|all the casino it's basically war it's basically two cards
data/028130.wav|to go public and spax had a big boom last year
data/007474.wav|we're not really known because i asked her if
data/026150.wav|much into it but i think people that are obsessed with
data/019782.wav|we're never going to be in the game they just openly misrepresented what
data/017535.wav|and the companies that are very good at that outside of the realm of just advertisements are seeing
data/003119.wav|it's not you know where you want to stay
data/028416.wav|i the military he started out you know when we were when i was a
data/018323.wav|okay so what a spec does
data/022797.wav|dollars in outstanding debt on the
data/011918.wav|the first meal is when i realized
data/028417.wav|was a little kid he was he was he just
data/017532.wav|we're dying they're becoming less a part of
data/019472.wav|i was blaming it all on
data/026965.wav|the forever in this space cafe but he can like escape to the digital world like it's just sad for what
data/027499.wav|so i stand to make about i don't
data/027714.wav|play on Barbie and she changed it
data/008656.wav|an auditor they've got a lot of things what it could be higher it could be seven percent or whatever but it needs to be like for for
data/006794.wav|i was like i should text him and
data/021866.wav|this one opening in chess if you give
data/001565.wav|i thought it was stumping for sure
data/004117.wav|so she had no problem with it she
data/028374.wav|gets promoted and whoever does it gets fired bandwidth is a big one if you guys don't
data/026667.wav|one thing they majorly invested in and they convinced all these big sports owners to invest 60 million dollars to buy an
data/030150.wav|in a fight today over who could type faster
data/005504.wav|the best i can say so you know it's the whole thing the whole thing is is it's hard to
data/028524.wav|i don't feel well you know i
data/017718.wav|it's one of the reasons i believe that um
data/025233.wav|we watching streams and streaming themselves uh they've already banned if
data/031765.wav|the japanese how is this how does this is this this
data/025061.wav|at the word despicable things convincing mothers in developing countries they should use nestle formula for their baby rather than breast milk like they shouldn't they shouldn't feed their own baby they should use nestle formula and try to make that they actually run like pr campaigns to make it seem like it's
data/008514.wav|got a little shaky and went down
data/004392.wav|and i would love to get you a free jersey so you can rep the
data/021168.wav|i have everything that's going to happen in the upcoming calendar year i have analyzed predicted and now i will reveal to you the marketing monday
data/031820.wav|if they're inviting him to sit with him but he still sits away
data/007488.wav|while original joe the original joe burger and
data/011421.wav|you back for letting me be your editor well almost i know you're joking but you technically because i let
data/015399.wav|explore releases so this was like one of the big innovations that has enabled
data/016846.wav|it's going to lead to all sorts of things
data/010579.wav|i want to go out i let him out he
data/022355.wav|a number three that new customers could use code dsc atria on
data/015220.wav|for every consumer in every market and that means even if they don't you know gain a lot of ground in america it doesn't matter as much they can have a bunch of cheap great shows that americans will still love
data/021818.wav|so you don't have to a marketing monday
data/024144.wav|which contracts because twitch was threatened
data/009775.wav|china's got a whole lot happening it's crazy time
data/029243.wav|no delay ah fans fans and as he's walking out
data/022133.wav|worse jobs i had at twitch
data/028151.wav|billion dollars in cash reserves they were gonna
data/032389.wav|i could do it consistently but i'm saying the the grind mode of
data/018055.wav|this is human beings trapped in a fire needing first aid pepsi man's whole shtick is that he goes to vending machines that are empty and fills them up so you can get more pepsi these people do not need pepsi pepsi man your antics will only
data/020014.wav|what if they just bought the whole internet
data/001948.wav|a little more time like if i just
data/010828.wav|two tournaments on saturday i am playing fall guys tournament
data/027809.wav|they didn't want to actually do it they know that if they actually do it
data/004795.wav|he possibly can to get out of buying this company now
data/015902.wav|doesn't this end up worse than cable because instead of
data/004066.wav|i am you're a thousand years early but you'll get there 2000
data/010461.wav|well there's no shot that was a month ah in total all monkey ball ever is
data/018410.wav|really pissed me off the amount of money they spent holy mackerel
data/026142.wav|cause i looked at what this guy did this guy
data/024712.wav|and then all of a sudden right about here
data/001534.wav|the okay very very and this is this is simple
data/029888.wav|was going to be amazing and we get there and i hit it off with manga right away
data/017514.wav|i will ban every single one of you without hesitation and
data/013450.wav|that's funny that's funny that's funny that's funny that's
data/000798.wav|i would have left with a nice little profit and i
data/006004.wav|with the best fox in the world oh judgment's
data/004509.wav|friends and family are there and i hope you just you never forget it thanks again and happy birthday sincerely

data/011684.wav|all the time she does cosplay
data/009286.wav|devs nowadays how can we escape this what do you mean speak on that the money grab mindset of game devs i think the reason game devs
data/024926.wav|and this quote made me so sad for the future of games
data/012850.wav|were dropped n a mid later
data/026836.wav|what it costs to create these are very very expensive and again you only get
data/028678.wav|boys today's video is about a very special topic near and dear to my heart how the hell a
data/014888.wav|halo infinite they had a really great

data/005524.wav|leave binds it must have been so hard
data/026777.wav|if you have a kidney you could sell these are all and then even if the whatever you buy turns out to be stupid and it's cratering just say huddle diamond hands
data/012567.wav|at the sponsorship and so my public account is
data/015714.wav|i and everything and it's like it's nice
data/013945.wav|are becoming very very successful and it's starting to have problems because people that are attracted
data/016866.wav|yup even more and as ai continues to evolve
data/027425.wav|well on twitter so it's a win for us who cares if we can't prosecute them we can't charge them

data/013665.wav|it can't stand on its own feet mixer didn't get you
data/031417.wav|ball and throw around the toss around the old
data/017144.wav|the deal it's part of the wheeling
data/013333.wav|although i'd love to hear your
data/027155.wav|the economy destroy people's pensions make a real estate worth way less and so if you tank it you will lose the election
data/009551.wav|best players in this whole game
data/018740.wav|apple but it did very poorly based on projections and everyone was asking why and all the analysts were saying like oh it's because china is losing
data/005027.wav|instead of trying to fight the bots
data/000410.wav|i'm jumping up running across the
data/022278.wav|well horrifying it's banned on tv
data/014018.wav|pull out there was like there was less than 20 bundles i think
data/020982.wav|because the guy has no pants

data/027198.wav|you can find my account on there and follow me
data/022601.wav|you can use one of these old things
data/002064.wav|yeah i should get one of
data/023084.wav|at the chip to snack on you got the munchies how do they stand out marketing okay so
data/002233.wav|going to work it feels like it's like a big waste of time and money and the ceo would be you
data/028296.wav|how come the toilet paper in the thing
data/004974.wav|it just doesn't look good when this
data/031752.wav|this wikipedia is so poorly structured you can't say
data/010843.wav|assassin who jumps around and sneaks around and does stuff doesn't exist so i'm
data/020950.wav|stop doing the project that's when you give up changing your mind
data/012640.wav|it's a year same time every year doesn't change
data/011314.wav|yeah and i didn't stay on campus
data/008655.wav|what of evidence twitter has manually reviewed nine thousand accounts every month they've got independent verifier
data/021634.wav|a lot of mixed opinions in the
data/014303.wav|people are just less hesitant to use
data/020648.wav|i think because all the primes go to him focus please focus cameraman i paid
data/014826.wav|well only a few days later we got this article so many ubisoft employees have quit
data/008368.wav|the way to learn you should worry about that
data/001682.wav|purpose as such willy wonka and the chocolate factory is a
data/013536.wav|during lunch beating the shot of them
data/029499.wav|the worst sandwich i've ever seen in my life was what they gave
data/002670.wav|i need and that is all you have to give me a number between one and six
data/021121.wav|you know we can all find things funny in different ways wendy's gets
data/004140.wav|isn't that all the messages are going through so that he can so i can actually like
data/019901.wav|as like this game what's the it was your first experience with any sex that's what it was i got it this game sucked i'll say it
data/015085.wav|by millions people were dipping left and
data/020516.wav|i work with a lot of marketing people
data/028810.wav|what i got offered i know for a fact now
data/011548.wav|the only good profile picture is a photoshop picture of yourself with
data/012573.wav|it out and there's like hundreds like six or seven hundred
data/016150.wav|i think the problem strange one day
data/005707.wav|conversation i i enjoyed talking to
data/031432.wav|like poseidon's nemesis because i threw
data/004149.wav|this stuff and also most importantly i have to like respond to them and like send them stats on the the views and yeah you have to like do things and this is so funny because i'm on the other side of this deal all the time like from the brand side we have to work with influencers and i'm often like in the position like hey we need this we paid you
data/031583.wav|with the crowd the crops losing their
data/010967.wav|and then i can jump into the gameplay
data/031562.wav|it's not even close to over but that means he can
data/011632.wav|and so i thought you know be hype is what if we did that
data/009654.wav|what if we did this what if we do this this will attack from the east and all the generals
data/024145.wav|it's by the rise of mixer and youtube youtube was doing big contracts for

data/011795.wav|when i was there and it looks like you're
data/026407.wav|or have and but i wanted to say this is
data/003591.wav|software engineer easy easy money infinite perks unlimited time off swap jobs every two years probably is declining
data/015453.wav|well combined okay disney has dominated theaters for the past few years but we're talking about streaming wars okay so that's the problem this is the problem if you're doing this good in theaters it becomes very hard internally
data/012269.wav|with the actors and anyway should we
data/024096.wav|the one of them was that there's gonna
data/030508.wav|i know i know but i don't crack
data/020549.wav|would be the toughest time in the company's
data/004671.wav|going to a cinema and wasting time it's about grinding and hustling so you embody the spirit that
data/012044.wav|amazing we are and he's like you can do it now without the training indicator
data/024614.wav|the main growth area for luxury bands in
data/026377.wav|it is one of the greatest measures of brand value
data/021489.wav|do the short the contract they make because
data/008872.wav|and they could i mean listen it it would be
data/029061.wav|from the theater so then i have to just sit there
data/021765.wav|funny because that is the core reason why mike myers would become wayne again
data/001448.wav|is the game over yeah the game sucked
data/003535.wav|is it not smart to buy a house right now it just depends on what deals some
data/031330.wav|so my dad has to fly out so i had to tell my parents what was going on and that i needed my dad to fly out and so he had to buy
data/028790.wav|it was like electric i was like
data/020187.wav|white the crab with laser eyes aerial font 32
data/001456.wav|the only thing is i need you to scout's honor not to google
data/014186.wav|cause they think that they've 100
data/006451.wav|of brilliance by beating a level 128
data/007461.wav|it's or whatever he's like ten percent if he's on a good day for him ten percent
data/011985.wav|if someone else chewbacca or something
data/026648.wav|and if you're interested in investing in activision blizzard stock because it's
data/004839.wav|so he's got a lot happening and
data/021812.wav|the helpful to real people in their real lives and then there's some stuff i want to make fun of so i got it all it's not just about
data/024408.wav|if the city very excited to have the great mp
data/029379.wav|about it and i realize if i just realized
data/022672.wav|sometimes a company will buy a company for a lot of money
data/012719.wav|summer that's it and i lost that summer that is
data/021963.wav|we get better at editing and
data/025047.wav|yeah i guess i guess that's true it's like who's going into a bird king and
data/021597.wav|as could commit a fraud dude the things
data/012154.wav|the room on screen and kills
data/015822.wav|i want to answer these questions my friend made his marketing
data/016271.wav|might take some responsibility step forward but it looks like he's contractually unable to be featured in a
data/001052.wav|very recently we've kind of branched out
data/027201.wav|information to market makers public does not do that they make the money off of unspent they just basically invest unspent money thanks again to the public
data/024092.wav|it's lane gives me extra beans what if you cannot afford a car they literally just
data/001384.wav|trying to throw me off i'm gonna guess oh
data/019726.wav|there are personal choices you can make people always talk about
data/022841.wav|it's deal was done with stock what that means is they bought time
data/017940.wav|of ways to get you more involved as a fan after you purchase something but it's it's uh it's a unique situation i
data/017215.wav|what all times and waking up in sweat is the
data/018166.wav|i don't even understand what is the
data/018779.wav|bare knuckle brawl i think it's going to be one of the greatest console wars now the real winner of course chat is the nvidia
data/028363.wav|and i say zoom out all the time i think
data/007005.wav|if the shocked me he grabs my arm
data/013042.wav|locally controlled public schools teachers have great autonomy and educators oh yeah autonomy
data/029839.wav|apple tournaments we would all go to

data/031821.wav|which is charitable it really is just hot tubs
data/005378.wav|a there's a bunch of people around

data/000397.wav|my god it was it was awesome
data/007260.wav|yeah that's anyway that's the story that's the story of me and j
data/022015.wav|was immediately after posting it the second
data/020632.wav|with scam to win awards which would normally only annoy me but it enrages me when the topic is a global
data/000745.wav|i really want to thank stance and lud and low you guys are all low but stands in
data/011517.wav|or to come and patrol the streets like storm troopers
data/028720.wav|and they're like oh yeah let's check it out
data/020838.wav|and you've clearly put a lot of thought
data/000779.wav|big plan to make the money back from vegas so hopefully it goes well
data/023918.wav|i understood what it was like to be a sports fan and it made me go like actual sports
data/029469.wav|i felt like damn this is just not working i
data/018682.wav|nervous going into this next generation they gotta get a hit they had a big idea with mixer
data/002710.wav|off the table immediately and you could lose
data/016108.wav|do fingers you think the lesson is always have a marketing name and uh don't doubt something just
data/021482.wav|the the shorts out of 70 billion dollars
data/010231.wav|yeah he's he's he's a wild one i think i mean he's got a unique ability to really not care he'll do
data/012651.wav|what do you remember from the shark cruiser that was fun she went to
data/009533.wav|yes it is because double is the one getting that kill but here comes
data/014444.wav|war that's i think that's where we're at right now twitch has

data/002908.wav|week trial period after which it will just ban your account
data/019568.wav|something for the client to say no to it's actually true it's always good to
data/002972.wav|things down around it that's very minor so i'm watching the whole movie i'm very invested i actually i
data/014665.wav|made me so there's going to be green stuff
data/018291.wav|i sent me this book and it was written by the guy who started this company
data/008855.wav|are you could probably make a mint
data/000401.wav|are weighing the most heavy i
data/016590.wav|we browser that like prevents you from going anywhere you could be hacked and doesn't hold any user data and they're basically just selling it
data/015165.wav|and what's important is this show did not cost a lot to make this show only
data/025640.wav|it's was hard to categorize as
data/024105.wav|chief marketing officer of hyundai said
data/007188.wav|and i was decent in norcal i wasn't
data/002778.wav|with the fastest route in the first three or four hours which will be really fun
data/007581.wav|have you seen the movie crimes
data/024780.wav|at the battle pass because the goal is to make the game part of your daily routine once you do this for 20 plus days it is
data/028465.wav|it was my dad's job as he
data/015880.wav|i think disney plus netflix bundle would crush actually of course it would but they well they don't want to do it
data/030868.wav|can you imagine having the power of time travel and using it to invest in
data/021591.wav|a panic and a snowball effect then it starts going down to zero okay once it goes down from somebody selling
data/023912.wav|i was growing up i like sports more now than i

data/021650.wav|legends the avengers parody we didn't
data/006785.wav|you know there's it's a split audience here and i could talk about that how miserable that game was forever and i have to get into the
data/028552.wav|at first year paying taxes and i just didn't know what i was doing and i thought i did it right and i got this bill and i was like dude what
data/001834.wav|i get this and so like rich architects and people are are
data/027606.wav|the from someone the crypto side who are worshiping elon musk twitter
data/007984.wav|done enough because you guys don't
data/021217.wav|if the backlog they might be in trouble they have
data/015818.wav|yeah that's that's almost a guarantee i think that's a big growth area
data/001200.wav|well now and then have you heard of lunchables
data/032144.wav|sign because i haven't even been enticed by anything yet i
data/021444.wav|if the money to pay for my dad's surgery or this is almost
data/022426.wav|knows that i'm better at live stuff like music
data/031669.wav|and i'm i'm like i'm like watching a

data/007121.wav|the captain announced that like while we were while we were flying or while we were taking off
data/027653.wav|it means for the future there is a real chance that five years from now twitter has to
data/008991.wav|when you can get twitter for free in the app store you are the first person to make that joke it definitely has not been it definitely has not been over a month since that joke was first made and it's been repeated hundreds of thousands of times pretty much every done this story brings up sense you are the first then i really appreciate that and it's an honor to have the cutting edge canadians when you can get twitter for free in the app store you are the first person to make that joke it definitely has not been it definitely has not been over a month since that joke was first made and it's been repeated hundreds of thousands of times pretty much every time this story brings up sense you are the first and i really
data/027534.wav|they literally shut it down i want to
data/009945.wav|if the was be slightly self-aware
data/007287.wav|but i gotta we gotta know
data/022052.wav|step one is they don't know what the hashtag is before they post so here's an example of
data/023536.wav|i was against companies with lower prices so for example you're thinking of maybe
data/006584.wav|sort of calls into question the
data/026293.wav|or cars keep their value longer than other cars and because of that this this amazing
data/011846.wav|it is it's a it's a
data/031065.wav|i mean i had amazon money like i twitch
data/024345.wav|i can't walk away with this
data/004981.wav|get rich me but all this is doing is losing these people money every single
data/001041.wav|bachelor party invitation might have got lost in the
data/004089.wav|t viewers could reach a stream
data/008565.wav|is higher than five percent and even if it is higher than five percent which he hasn't shown the evidence
data/004479.wav|it's a problem and if i were to just cut back a little
data/025381.wav|i was going to call this
data/024191.wav|i'm sort of interested i'm gonna
data/000741.wav|talk about the future and and i just i tell
data/016742.wav|a fantastic solution for a a populist that will not go vegetarian i
data/027954.wav|a perfect man vin diesel he claimed that diesel always shows up late to the set doesn't know his lines and he shows up out of shape what about family justin lin and what's crazy is if you look more into this
data/018755.wav|we'll have something about the camera that is different
data/003940.wav|sony sees a massive support for the character morbius for president they
data/014734.wav|alex stitched together when i watch
data/017248.wav|fake a deep voice buy a bunch of
data/026884.wav|incredibly rushed i understand that every second is hundreds of thousands of dollars when you're buying seven million dollars for
data/014373.wav|drops are powerful youtube needs to copy
data/029926.wav|in that tournament people still said like oh it was
data/016176.wav|yeah you know what you actually save a lot of money on gas
data/030837.wav|too much about my stream now my co-workers know far too much about my
data/017924.wav|would company ever think about post purchase to get you back into a repeat customer but
data/004760.wav|at the current ceo who he was buying the company from
data/017556.wav|they have consistently rated the best brand in the world
data/030671.wav|i just know how to write it and they're like
data/017739.wav|and the clock model is a way to think about any brand and in fact you can
data/026820.wav|hand over fists creators are going to
data/015826.wav|either dies replaced with online or gets a version on streaming services look daily news watching on cable is like that's already so
data/029011.wav|me and mango are the same age you're
data/028466.wav|okay so so let me try to paint the picture for you
data/028749.wav|a restaurant and we get in because he's there and we
data/016496.wav|years ago you're probably going to do better than someone who
data/006345.wav|it's time for the first time in over a month to get back to a little marketing on this channel a little bit of business news a little bit of what's going on in the world but of course before we do that i'm
data/010846.wav|no singed the most cringe champ
data/003821.wav|ten years is i i think there's
data/011886.wav|cause this is a plus like this look
data/000732.wav|as two three five four five and gets a 21.
data/009869.wav|it's like as big as texas dude that's not true but
data/022293.wav|at the friends through it and build a community maybe they start to
data/025294.wav|what my second theme on original content netflix has the bulk of it prime video number two with invincible and the boys number three disney plus apple tv hulu hbo max paramount plus and other which
data/006115.wav|if the counter pop off is like the most nine head maneuver
data/023925.wav|his talk about the way quackity
data/021982.wav|worked his ass off for 30 years
data/014121.wav|which are still by far the highest deals by the way i can't comment on specific deal numbers of anybody
data/025085.wav|it's like people that have use the product people that spend money to go to university phoenix often feel it's like people that have used the product people that spend money
data/027021.wav|you're super bowl they didn't know how to tackle it this year they are back what did they come back with for budweiser one of the longest and most storied
data/008797.wav|could the banks withdraw their financing
data/016049.wav|various grinding on streaming i've got a bunch of big plans
data/009166.wav|yeah yeah yeah and so your dopamine receptors go
data/000763.wav|i had a genius video idea so when you're walking around vegas there's a lot of like moving billboards and uh and
data/017919.wav|where's through one avenue you're watching the
data/031184.wav|he actually did so much to fill that amount of hours with content it it now that i am a
data/009083.wav|gaming vibing talking doing all sorts
data/029862.wav|if he admits he would make you feel like you weren't human he
data/012346.wav|just been told that you have to use your galactic grabbers well you're a little bit
data/012387.wav|well so far ahead of me and ari he was like way he was
data/014131.wav|it's toast now again he personally is doing fine he's getting some good numbers
data/023253.wav|a garden hose on the restaurant
data/028458.wav|i'm really just tuned out and then this young airman like a
data/025537.wav|good console with a bad one and so
data/005469.wav|and i didn't get too many of that although i can tell you this is
data/030363.wav|the chatters i had a photographer ready yeah i had a whole thing
data/022787.wav|close to zero then what you've lost
data/031632.wav|was what i said i don't remember what i said
data/031610.wav|i can't i i have no ability to move the conversation along this guy liquid
data/027564.wav|if you thought the company's being
data/028404.wav|we're in a big zoom call meeting or
data/005158.wav|pretty small fingers right so it's not a lot
data/000933.wav|two months you have seven messages four of
data/029313.wav|i want to work in esports but i had just
data/013832.wav|earning potential which is on brand for microsoft what are you
data/021068.wav|if you've never heard of the whole point is take five
data/030277.wav|but unfortunately we had a very active
data/021646.wav|it's for to consider buying evs
data/024660.wav|what we could call a global financial crisis
data/010475.wav|the thing to happen people put on the problem face and they double down on it
data/012752.wav|the league of legends character than any human being on planet earth it was across all servers including
data/003827.wav|it it be the biggest party i'm just saying uh
data/002488.wav|pringles are trash on every laze bag
data/031483.wav|hundred hours no i'm sorry like
data/016741.wav|emissions it's exceeded by just cow
data/004498.wav|you understand because by that line of thought then i could be wishing every single person
data/000255.wav|it is the reason that i hated scooby
data/014890.wav|they're both doing quite well and
data/013441.wav|was very adamant about yesterday i found out it's because
data/028408.wav|it goes oh well you know the
data/014645.wav|to be talking about marketing not on the
data/015678.wav|the fierce competitors these three companies are fierce as competitors and if you're not one of these three it's going to get harder and harder for you so my prediction is that almost all
data/018982.wav|so even if it was just
data/003589.wav|yeah that's a good way to explain it yeah a recession is like when ryan
data/006278.wav|i start otherwise it'll be half the video me eating
data/004409.wav|which i will explain i think correct me if i'm
data/012531.wav|me myself if it was me myself i don't know
data/027971.wav|exactly one player this game just launched and is already down to exactly one player on a live service game it is the first live service game that i have seen where the staff working on it
data/001839.wav|usually people say good work in that
data/031372.wav|in my but apparently i have been misled at some point because he has rented an
data/014091.wav|we'll have to know about this and so
data/019132.wav|talk about it in a bit and there's not that many games for this launch it's almost
data/001437.wav|i made it so easy a new hope you
data/030332.wav|yeah we found this today facebook alerted it there's
data/015750.wav|had good months here and there and are using these as trend lines for a future that doesn't exist because people had good months here and there and they're using these as trend lines for a future
data/008441.wav|ooh thank you for the one year a firm handshake and a firmer salute you said hey big a thanks for the great
data/009120.wav|and so i thought okay i'll explain even though the comment was rude i wrote a response explaining why
data/018404.wav|well that's the aaa title you showed that one i'm sure
data/031554.wav|he's not even mining from his main base and we're only like
data/000868.wav|you all to put your voices together in one chorus and sing the iconic
data/007927.wav|it was more than it feels more than like
data/027426.wav|we can't make any meaningful legal progress on on changing the way they are we can always ratio them dude yes yes
data/007348.wav|that was promised is what i said and that's
data/022930.wav|subtle but straightforward shutting down like hell no and what's funny is epic literally whips out their dong dude
data/008137.wav|if i'm glad i gifted him
data/005706.wav|it was really fun we had it
data/030433.wav|it'll be good to do it like that would make sense is valentine's day because we're
data/026184.wav|and you guys are you guys are literally on
data/008840.wav|like three times as much as it's worth is overpaying ah with less money so obviously he wants the bad he was the get out as much like three times as much as it's worth he's overpaying uh with less money
data/020025.wav|as revenue paypal is currently worth 250
data/017645.wav|alpha million dollars to open but
data/001969.wav|if tomorrow you said you cannot stream you cannot work for nvidia you have to be a waffle maker i would be
data/007697.wav|got bullied i got bullied i got
data/024225.wav|arrow potential some ads were shot for 20
data/013276.wav|but it is dope and it is progress because people like to watch things that way
data/007791.wav|to myself yeah i could do that otherwise you would yeah exactly yeah yeah
data/003267.wav|seven days the god it's all it's interesting i think
data/030536.wav|literally so obvious but i was
data/003728.wav|fall but it's it's it's not that it's uh
data/004303.wav|think with no problem the music might be a
data/020049.wav|in my first five months of uploading youtube i'm extremely excited i've had a lot of fun with youtube
data/028193.wav|or whatever and there was so much snow on the roof that the it was like a collapse risk and
data/012146.wav|it's the good and everybody so anyway at one point i say something
data/010330.wav|you guys are still suggesting people even though we've got way over budget here
data/018424.wav|okay let me explain why that's important because
data/018707.wav|owning the biggest oil company it's
data/031206.wav|those are the kind of clips that really rocked back then
data/020328.wav|accurate but you guys have given it a
data/029094.wav|and that baby could cry let me tell
data/020213.wav|was me i have to shower
data/020675.wav|are they are a hundred thieves
data/007989.wav|so thankfully i'm fully happy to explain it yet again but
data/006796.wav|i was like what why he's like
data/011125.wav|i got a perfect solution for that it actually comes
data/012704.wav|i think mmos are built to suck up like
data/021117.wav|know what maybe maybe you guys would laugh more if i was like i i
data/031422.wav|this dog is not ours we brought our i brought
data/026316.wav|in sell at the scale they do at the prices they
data/019478.wav|and it charts number one i
data/003500.wav|tips bill that went through congress to it's basically going to all go to intel to make foundries which are the factories that make chips
data/017413.wav|but some data has come out showing that gen z has the lowest usage of drugs and alcohol ever
data/022261.wav|you must be hungry fuel up on campus chunky soup wow
data/002581.wav|or in my chat let's find out we're gonna
data/030198.wav|him he said afterwards he made it over the top
data/003844.wav|redistribution with like good home values
data/009518.wav|carrying you know what i'm saying
data/002869.wav|the judge ruled that not only will the court case take place in september but it will be five days she said specifically the court case will last five days that's it we will handle this you will make arguments
data/004669.wav|the the minions rise of gru i didn't see it
data/019734.wav|eminem came back hard with a
data/005199.wav|i listen here's the only thing is i don't think i would do it again because
data/029423.wav|the reason i brought this up is
data/022564.wav|i was real life reminder that you can't ignore you can choose
data/002850.wav|like this judge and again the delaware court
data/014852.wav|in a deeper dive on some of the legacy developers that are starting to really struggle and i think
data/022765.wav|was not dumb in this mark cuban was

data/010480.wav|the appropriate response to the coffee cow saga
data/029596.wav|and i actually started thinking out loud i wonder if there is some influence that's happening where
data/008887.wav|i they want to make this buyout to begin with
data/023567.wav|if they can get the blue line up to
data/027206.wav|they were hand-holding quite a bit and this went
data/026229.wav|they don't want to they say everything's easy fun smile clean app if you miss any
data/025530.wav|the bolster their first party lineup
data/029578.wav|where it's like this guy plays this way and this
data/012698.wav|and they all get in the
data/029209.wav|where's tournaments but they won't sub
data/012922.wav|it's it was just tough like the overall follower
data/011198.wav|it is a money it costs no effort and the money just flows in
data/028290.wav|if the follow the same rules of life the rest
data/023337.wav|it kind of stunned me and that is this it was announced today there is now a
data/023028.wav|one could lose money i i would like a world where this
data/010732.wav|let's watch season three episode one of the boys for this sponsor
data/010516.wav|right so you can understand i'm not like a regular fan i'm an intelligent understand my my
data/000586.wav|wait they're all small yeah you can
data/009152.wav|bro if i feel like if i'm a person that loved elon musk and i see all of his
data/024074.wav|true design because people aren't eating in the restaurant as much it's basically designed for a future where there's a lot more
data/011982.wav|i was the coolest that was the coolest thing
data/011523.wav|and that's like that's the reply i was writing like paragraphs
data/006926.wav|for your mind one time for your mind ow
data/025246.wav|one for content on his chinese reddit
data/016468.wav|the actual topic of today and this some
data/018012.wav|listen you guys know i've been a complete
data/016514.wav|one that's relevant to all of us here and that is it's not going to play is it
data/001447.wav|if you're adventurous you could do like a skydiving
data/020560.wav|would have been to release the pc version now because you get best bug feedback from
data/022460.wav|greatness is not some rare dna strand it's not some precious thing
data/021999.wav|equality in cooking scholarship now those tweets got you know a few million impressions few thousand likes this tweet got a hundred million plus
data/003092.wav|at american consumers have never felt this financially insecure since they started recording the data this trend is getting very bad
data/028234.wav|with the couch on twitch because he really
data/029048.wav|he puts his arms up and like immediately like gut reaction
data/026039.wav|it's like a draft amazon is hiring employees as if they are about to go to war if they keep up this growth they'll be
data/022838.wav|and subsequently lost my job we looked
data/013707.wav|with the other company than roblox every gaming
data/001588.wav|and the winter i'm the winner i'm the
data/012239.wav|we're really late we're running very late i showed up late
data/009045.wav|you are desperately on their alienware gaming laptop hitting up their
data/001810.wav|so people could know i was doing it and
data/027693.wav|because this is what the average Democratic senator
data/002822.wav|but there's actual business reasons talking about
data/022702.wav|hundred million dollars but all that did was drive the few people that were still using tumblr off the website
data/019942.wav|what a million dollars is nothing in business that would
data/014406.wav|because there is no more need for someone to download edit and
data/007296.wav|at the crowd and i said i will bet any amount of money on any game for j
data/021186.wav|five and over have over 67
data/014503.wav|it's getting around something very interesting there
data/026054.wav|alexa told a 10 year old girl
data/018750.wav|it'll lower the price in fact i
data/019686.wav|peter scott king delroy check out his music check out
data/019352.wav|but really this moment shines through we lost
data/000173.wav|and we're missing one of our friends
data/010531.wav|saying that even though i know you're probably very very very very busy
data/027716.wav|boomer you are part of this problem because she made
data/017998.wav|and they have a conservative majority
data/017369.wav|the amazon fail let's give a win to
data/024490.wav|kind of wanted both companies to lose and so
data/029754.wav|i don't trust the vimeo link you better be a monopoly for me to trust
data/005381.wav|in your nails done in life check
data/012485.wav|anyway they all texted me after the fact they were like hey glad
data/011685.wav|you know she made the gun for cutie the jinx
data/027609.wav|was in their minds and then i think most of them though fall into this camp and i found a twitter employee that i think
data/004177.wav|late night elden ring maybe that's
data/007914.wav|and a lot of them are
data/010817.wav|it the some stuff before we start the sponsor which i will reveal asked me to do a
data/031169.wav|it help but like abuse people that just have a warped sense of what's going on bro
data/023290.wav|cristiano ronaldo did not give a single
data/023984.wav|keep fundamental level they did understand that they need titties to make profit
data/028344.wav|and in a very very very unfortunate turn of events
data/024139.wav|it's it's pretty big that the spending on twitch streamers has started or on streamers in general
data/015984.wav|and that's what game pass is
data/003469.wav|of the dog but what i will try to do is get a little bit more balanced so it's not so bleak but i do want to
data/020345.wav|what bit of bravery are you
data/016140.wav|it was pretty good yeah that's
data/025046.wav|actually there's something to complain about
data/016726.wav|one that i didn't know about lab-grown meat
data/024036.wav|is going to be worse than just figuring out some kind of deal with the banks later on it was worded towards
data/002559.wav|i'm gonna need a heads or a tails
data/003965.wav|i we're going to do it and then tyler1 will
data/024974.wav|but because people were like legos
data/013668.wav|in worse than mixer but then you hit me up with atriox tube
data/020436.wav|i laughed i cried it's a perfect
data/010379.wav|let's find out donkey's video the looker
data/021749.wav|i played league of legends in college
data/027847.wav|just because it's hot and there's a lot of funding versus the ones that
data/003694.wav|the wealth gap in the 20s was equally as bad
data/030437.wav|i kind of nervous i'm like and i have to hide the ring in our small hotel room so we get to the
data/010707.wav|if you have to include that hundred thousand dollars extra you get as a bonus from mr beast every year
data/005807.wav|at all i wanted to do was
data/026001.wav|wiggin dollars of investors money without
data/028262.wav|type of person like literally they could not have given up like usually usually
data/023070.wav|what the competition and when there's a lot of competition between products that are essentially indistinguishable they serve the same need okay your hunger the only way they can differentiate themselves
data/028540.wav|if the person today at the end of day we can help you
data/000434.wav|but it doesn't matter because every time
data/022935.wav|be a win-win the longer this drags out it will be less so i cannot think of a scenario where epic
data/002753.wav|and the algorithm do not get to compete you already make enough money at google congratulations to
data/020848.wav|well he dropped what i think is the single greatest advice thread on twitter you can decide we're
data/001712.wav|the factory or the tim burton directed remake of that name that came out in
data/017799.wav|you would actually see a significant drop off in
data/002375.wav|thank you very inspirational for our investment strategies
data/001634.wav|it will be in the video
data/032345.wav|this implies he wasn't grinding radiant
data/000061.wav|was so hard imagine how much celery you can choke down with the boys
data/029411.wav|or for 30 minutes while everyone's paying
data/024348.wav|promoting their name change is that
data/021059.wav|i just shipped my pants and it's very
data/018497.wav|this is how much this is how much sony made all year this is a
data/008153.wav|quack quack quack i might need you to upload mon frere
data/014784.wav|it's just a great way to separate your stuff it also has easy way to track all your expenses it has easy way to send and
data/024110.wav|are you ready are you ready
data/002226.wav|okay but um are we going to have vegan
data/018842.wav|oh inspired by a true story why I
data/027637.wav|what he come from and it turns out the vast majority of this is debbie is taking out a lot of debt and i thought okay what's the interest payment on this day and it what he come from and it turns out the vast majority of this is debt he is taking out a lot of debt and i thought okay
data/026736.wav|we're talk about this in my next marketing monday
data/007700.wav|are you trying to rush me
data/019534.wav|or commercial and this is a better jingle but either way
data/028531.wav|i start calling every tax person in in i
data/027569.wav|republicans in congress were getting ready to sue twitter for not doing their fiduciary duty
data/030739.wav|i don't mess with the little dubs
data/022574.wav|be a prank this would only be a
data/015205.wav|and peacock in the united states only so if you're netflix and
data/004003.wav|really back to it in a major way
data/031672.wav|watching and then all of a sudden
data/000324.wav|it's not like vr when you're here when you
data/015548.wav|that's it bro title is a failed music service he only bought it because he likes hanging out with
data/031786.wav|want the of twitch it has literally been amaranth with 90 percent
data/001735.wav|so he bets it'll be like oh it'll be
data/007139.wav|and but then the thing about
data/029137.wav|that was one of the funniest things
data/011904.wav|i thought she was one of the actors the whole trip until the
data/000217.wav|fancy whiskey with like muddled cherry
data/020528.wav|there is no chance they just leave this
data/027947.wav|and down so you can like almost do
data/010038.wav|especially kind of long but i i i
data/025802.wav|we summarizes what the past few years have
data/006094.wav|you thought it was the whole debate over whether or not you were allowed to
data/028991.wav|yo no shot uh yo no shot what
data/003236.wav|and that's how low the bar is i
data/002044.wav|both no you can't be both obviously
data/007106.wav|meet him out of interest to a large amount of interest to a large amount of
data/028076.wav|if if the they're like wait a minute if this keeps going people aren't
data/008598.wav|with all of his lawyers his massive
data/027661.wav|it's basically people pay for a check mark
data/015759.wav|most competitive so the american market is where everyone's fighting for except for netflix but it means everything's expensive and it's really hard to make any gains american consumers are pretty good about playing multiple services off each other
data/023995.wav|and that's like almost no time so they said basically like
data/015762.wav|well they sort of did with
data/015583.wav|and they don't make their own content really but what they do is they buy
data/023067.wav|is the average amount an american
data/000100.wav|we movie brother can't wait to see there i pants next thing we movie brother can't wait to see you there
data/029687.wav|i was losing i made a comeback i was down like three games of one or
data/000174.wav|i was there dude oh yeah
data/011860.wav|what you are is that you're in a windowless prison room but the the
data/012797.wav|we were paid like basically only in
data/023514.wav|buying this car the answer is a
data/021846.wav|actual photo of jeff bezos age
data/028336.wav|is swearing by the way finish
data/001691.wav|all of the reasons they hate
data/032265.wav|i've been destroyed at crabs i've been destroyed
data/016630.wav|in a city like new york it was
data/000204.wav|in fair that he got away
data/016596.wav|i'm sorry you can't see the number
data/024305.wav|for it didn't have morpheus singing which was
data/015806.wav|but but the live movies which is kind of amazing um will cable companies die out it'll be
data/015964.wav|what we want to keep the xbox brand cohesive and
data/017541.wav|me and owned india but that it was more of a government
data/017766.wav|drastically when he was on twitch
data/023007.wav|it's so big we don't give two shits we'll
data/017467.wav|they were flooded with fake job applications by
data/025224.wav|is a win here actually no this
data/003441.wav|interesting bit of news uh the
data/009628.wav|and years you'll beat me bro people used to
data/001824.wav|in psychopath murderer sorry that for that ruins
data/022038.wav|i my general thought is that this is
data/025623.wav|anyway that's a fail that was a fail i'm
data/005612.wav|literally hearing about it live and song
data/031749.wav|the word golden grab you can just write
data/028967.wav|if the people okay so i go and i apply for a new debit card and it's going to be sent to the military base the
data/002707.wav|there's a catch i will offer you
data/032147.wav|everybody i see stands i see
data/009824.wav|but we are finally picking up on it which is good
data/014164.wav|what like a big cash out event you have to go
data/005950.wav|like making his own brand and you don't forget this
data/006027.wav|yeah you can leave dude you're actually you're
data/011551.wav|cause that says yes i'm going to engage you
data/022886.wav|but that wasn't even a kid they paid a lot of money for that
data/000417.wav|what part of the casino so i'm running i'm literally running over to the table
data/003000.wav|she's by that front exit like she can see down
data/003531.wav|like if you have a car that works and you're like
data/017728.wav|that stuff ever will and apple's over investment and really
data/030865.wav|i just got hit with some shrapnel i passed out and i dreamed this entire
data/029264.wav|one time players could finally take
data/020918.wav|what other people it'll be competitive as
data/011794.wav|and then all you can't really see out the window but you can see
data/011043.wav|it could be happy except whirlwind i'm not sure what's happened but
data/005813.wav|by the way i think he has that chance i think
data/025343.wav|because they needed someone quickly and and i worked at
data/019964.wav|finding nemo those movies did have huge franchises those movies were amazing
data/000764.wav|in the street that are like and the car billboards that are like for sex workers it's like for escorts or for like
data/006486.wav|we are probably almost certainly actually i'm saying probably to be nice
data/003419.wav|the united states is trying to bring up taiwan's profile and legitimacy with
data/023169.wav|you know we all be a little more authentic on social
data/021322.wav|built a among us competitor okay they paid someone to make it they own it and they stream it they all stream it
data/002555.wav|person in a scam sweatshop is on the other end of
data/014246.wav|ways to do this and that's why i think twitch would have been fine letting
data/001890.wav|it's hanging on by a goddamn thread what do
data/016504.wav|is growing exponentially like a hockey stick it's worth spending at least five
data/000196.wav|he's the guy that had the skate fast eat ass bush did
data/008085.wav|well conversation led right to that point it's like you prompted this conversation
data/026536.wav|if somebody's not getting the memo but they're
data/004459.wav|what would my fast food crossover be probably whoever pays me
data/004786.wav|let me pull that up again one more time
data/018203.wav|and i remember seeing it and thinking it was very obvious this is a bmw guy
data/022450.wav|if you have no friends and no one
data/008875.wav|screamed like the johnny depp amber heard trial
data/026109.wav|at three cent raise they went on strike and
data/026212.wav|where of these companies that are starting to pop up that are having massive success under a model that is being called
data/021557.wav|it's going to be like a scam on wall street bets i mean people are so hungry for more of this they're going to jump on anything
data/009405.wav|scales really well into the late game
data/006402.wav|a fintech startup and this is like one of the greatest
data/022511.wav|i just love being clever dude like what if we made the tomatoes
data/020103.wav|'em ceo it's funny i found some old articles from the time
data/015980.wav|you can't lose then you raise prices and
data/016284.wav|you know what though it doesn't even matter because look at this i was thinking
data/032067.wav|at the time so that nobody pulled
data/018289.wav|it's your first you got here first
data/028315.wav|was one of the older people there
data/003996.wav|there are a lot i know that i miss a couple days i'm
data/010664.wav|i on learning and if you're
data/019898.wav|this game is nowhere near what they promised they promised much like no man's sky a life simulator
data/025850.wav|the gaming environment and companies that understand
data/007810.wav|wins and fails shark tank react or some kind of react and i do targeting tuesday tomorrow on the topic with a little bit more polish a little bit more
data/005139.wav|well let me tell you uh
data/017749.wav|many car companies will run ads just to prevent buyers remorse from
data/005564.wav|we kept driving and apparently smashed the window
data/007867.wav|what i think of it all massive colossal one or three read thank you for the
data/031618.wav|americans would call other americans foreigners because if you're not
data/022159.wav|up the emotion consistently so we're in for a hell of a run of sad ads today now
data/004276.wav|if the marketing monday speaking of marketing monday how about you tag yourself because we're jumping into it
data/027465.wav|that got caught on camera kissing timothy
data/019293.wav|well but the theme of all this is to say that it's going to be a real war which is incredibly good for the consumer so if you're interested and if you haven't
data/016513.wav|thirty years okay this is peak male performance so let's start with a trend
data/027840.wav|people don't want to invest in a company that owes a lot of money has no plan to get
data/023482.wav|if a car buyer and has an average salary about
data/029691.wav|like that that's actually exactly what i said i will call you the people's
data/023541.wav|on offering things under their cost let's be honest here's the truth of the matter the average person did not have the ability to have a private chauffeur anywhere they wanted to go okay and now suddenly since
data/016553.wav|as this continues to drop a lot of things in society are
data/004234.wav|stop to the moon but you know be careful cause
data/031930.wav|know people could even like really notice us because i was in my own zone but they could and it was awkward and
data/016860.wav|in the world and it's going to make a major
data/021317.wav|another interesting graph in this past year in gaming is that rust and among us both after years of no sales use creators to make millions these
data/009921.wav|instead that you hated unions have you ever
data/010197.wav|well so what'd you do afterwards you
data/006280.wav|and if you guys made a
data/025056.wav|google microsoft facebook basically across the entire globe not a lot of variety here it's basically
data/007983.wav|i feel like in my mind i've explained it a lot
data/027888.wav|why would you pay rent in a mall when you could set up your business online and sell direct but it turns out over the past few years as it's become more
data/006234.wav|that's one thing if you like investing your own money into
data/003341.wav|on that and then i'll do one funny one to
data/027012.wav|people have their money just sitting around doing nothing that's bad they shouldn't do that they're getting crushed by inflation well i feel for him they're
data/023905.wav|i mean this is just crazy that's that's the comeback story of like any sport that's and
data/010201.wav|or like aerosolized i don't know what the magic is
data/028272.wav|it was he still worked there he was lying to us
data/018803.wav|it's very average next add oh
data/015039.wav|more than now to get dvds delivered
data/021040.wav|know that doritos is sort of a gamer
data/015779.wav|nobody could outbid cable companies on sports but finally like amazon and big tech companies are starting to like youtube and amazon are
data/011106.wav|that's an interesting theory so you don't believe in any
data/000883.wav|what you want in this entire world you could
data/017415.wav|we've been really hanging out with other human
data/014649.wav|well as i can't believe your name is nfl on fox that feels like you're just branding yourself for no reason downtown jb they have the prime war zombie
data/027864.wav|going down the thing is great companies amazon for example apple these are
data/007626.wav|like no one ever talks about that they always say like quack doesn't know
data/030977.wav|go off king damn i i immediately i mean i literally the second i saw this i was like
data/013936.wav|your payments if you are delayed for any reason the fees that you will accrue
data/024128.wav|now before we go to the future i want to take you on a journey through my past let's take a look at some of the odd jobs i've done over the years
data/002966.wav|nope oh oh wait can i interrupt can i interrupt this okay this is not related
data/015167.wav|what i'm saying is it worked so they spent 28
data/028997.wav|so where you got can beat a
data/013471.wav|to the next level dude look at this toddler with zero income broke and how he turned his life around by grinding and now he's the youngest actor in the
data/008607.wav|and it's and it's locked and it's good
data/026448.wav|if that cultural moment but i only have one i have one or two maybe i have maybe sheesh was a thing for
data/006883.wav|more than i am to be here bro to work for you it was crazy it was a it was it was it was wild it was not

data/023151.wav|i got a ton of engagement but not like not a lot
data/020938.wav|it is unlikely that is fine isn't
data/030646.wav|and it's like me maybe one
data/027542.wav|don't change it now let me talk about some of the upsides and downsides so the only reason there are basically two reasons that the board of twitter would not want to accept his deal because you know this is this is all about money
data/027149.wav|that they stop printing money they start
data/025974.wav|if blizzard blizzard and i want to end
data/003642.wav|listen the thing i hate the most about
data/012065.wav|do the dark side thing the actor was the best actor he was the most the lieutenant
data/009364.wav|and you're asking if it's still
data/029156.wav|i love pokemon so much i wanted to play it that every day every day after school i would come home and play the first four hours of pokemon i would pop in two fresh double
data/008130.wav|so supportive of both the stream and the
data/016609.wav|important because this is uh a trend
data/031209.wav|i'm charles painter and today we're going to be talking about the marketing campaigns of the
data/014271.wav|talk about where we're going next with the streaming wars because now things are
data/018539.wav|which currently loses money now there is goals that's why you hear about the new

data/006609.wav|was back to back you know how do you turn that into a video i
data/025533.wav|get expensive we'll get more uh
data/029788.wav|as a scar and toth but the other side of that
data/005149.wav|well salon for you know macho
data/032259.wav|he looks at him kind of like
data/026676.wav|sort of frustrated me at the time seemed to
data/024329.wav|it's company changed their name to aviva
data/006596.wav|saw it through osmosis nobody paid so they the meme did something for the viewership of the movie but i don't
data/002598.wav|is this scarlet witch or something
data/031132.wav|way harder just way harder and had better ideas and was not afraid to
data/005368.wav|has stepped in jarvis goes jarvis is like hey waving back
data/005197.wav|the whole thing is interesting i think it was pretty fun
data/029558.wav|is the first time nintendo's extending us
data/032334.wav|the on radiance over four stream sessions
data/005570.wav|if he got his contact information
data/007470.wav|and i want to order breakfast for dinner because i'm quirky like that
data/013139.wav|are they want to have killer ip and then put it everywhere across every platform and all of the old media companies are trying to get into games like they already have movies and
data/020991.wav|the characters it's 15 seconds long
data/013710.wav|money where their mouth is and
data/007037.wav|well for yourself check out max w
data/017807.wav|or stuff here you could put you know
data/025743.wav|the marketing message and be interesting it's
data/003006.wav|it leaves her wallet like we start moving
data/015390.wav|if your max other streamers were doing better
data/016506.wav|i was on anything but eldon ring nobody
data/003482.wav|the that ring up that dog is gonna
data/026226.wav|wait for any reason the fees that you will
data/003889.wav|in slam the thing and say dirty to
data/019867.wav|if the city of heroes the point i'm making folks i could go on
data/026220.wav|it is actually worse and more expensive than credit cards and everyone you look at the reasons people
data/000468.wav|we get there and nick allen as drunk
data/031068.wav|three years younger than me and also had no income and he was doing challenging me to
data/004690.wav|yeah and that'll really bring it together
data/022162.wav|and people really felt a connection to it it wasn't too obtrusive about using their products and uh it's
data/006082.wav|good for melee their next matchup
data/023895.wav|which means he had to lose
data/014479.wav|i thought but i just did both interviews i did tours of both areas and i was like you know what nvidia just seems a little more exciting like i i
data/029662.wav|it's time for the main event and the rap song starts playing left
data/026119.wav|there i think they're raising a strike fund a couple
data/026238.wav|and realize that they're not really
data/007045.wav|i've ever had in the history of melee it felt so
data/019316.wav|his name this kid was the biggest business school stoner
data/008013.wav|and the most important number one reason i like it is
data/015296.wav|for the past year is massive but it was only 17
data/022662.wav|it just works do you want to meet ron in
data/022305.wav|that's gonna make it worse flash
data/021012.wav|it is and it's the reason
data/001490.wav|if only i could know the answer to do
data/012637.wav|depressed you're depressed okay and you know you take it out on me
data/029206.wav|people in general don't sub or
data/029418.wav|i write up this whole email right this whole big email to this guy like hey was great talking with you
data/003522.wav|we can actually pressure elected officials
data/004721.wav|it up a quincy plushie any minute now
data/002385.wav|with the first time really since the game came out
data/000726.wav|the high point i think that was the final hurrah and
data/024995.wav|the athletes aren't standing for the flag or
data/011900.wav|yeah it like it takes you out of you being
data/028354.wav|oh my god dude just screaming and
data/023227.wav|in the box but when i first noticed it
data/022042.wav|i think this one should just be deleted
data/006057.wav|a lot of stories to tell
data/005055.wav|the the announcement that's wild so
data/026068.wav|industries thank god these people finally got a win spider-man alone was
data/021922.wav|i mean in my early streams i had
data/006778.wav|i just because i was just
data/025129.wav|i have a little bit more of a fire under your ass
data/008552.wav|twitter every year has to put out a
data/012489.wav|had to hide the paper trail yeah exactly
data/008264.wav|and uh and we are going to talk about
data/021662.wav|i'm gonna tell you why this that was good
data/002769.wav|i dunno what we're gonna do we can do we may even do
data/022938.wav|where and how but we're gonna do it also they
data/001217.wav|a great example if you're 18
data/024731.wav|well yeah everything's fine no yeah today was it yeah we're down
data/018169.wav|everybody pepsi drink pepsi pepsi only my choice
data/026605.wav|the new series warped premieres jen
data/009255.wav|if the and nine months andre gravy thing for the
data/004525.wav|big a i finally caught a stream by
data/001888.wav|waiting for youtube and they got to do all sorts
data/010642.wav|in a minute you all will be explained okay
data/030568.wav|there that's a more candid one
data/020537.wav|they have a launch week and then they go so most games have to get
data/020502.wav|all this up and live in a shack in poland if i could work at
data/027500.wav|the immediate upside is good for me let's look at what happened this is twitter stock elon musk
data/025330.wav|who decided to quit that's the origin story for
data/010436.wav|it's to meal you know mac and cheese
data/014883.wav|or for themselves the developer and i thought it was a really smart speech he said that all the
data/015544.wav|is that they go to apple world because it's good
data/017798.wav|if the often with high impact high value sets it's one of the reasons i believe if
data/005475.wav|while i was sitting down at just i was in like a lawn chair in the sun eating a
data/020778.wav|it wasn't this year but it could be any
data/025681.wav|if the favorite scary ads of all time and by
data/016764.wav|is anything about him and they are
data/026729.wav|is do anything possible to get people on the platform and then once you have enough then you have the scale
data/016805.wav|if the for inflation so you guys don't think it's
data/018793.wav|what do you think rate this ad chad has
data/009119.wav|but i'm like you know what i want to help people understand what's going on here i feel like
data/012957.wav|you have to have a goal in mind i wouldn't do it just to do it that's just
data/021936.wav|i actually just because people i
data/022146.wav|that's it marketing monday silence brand drake's if you enjoyed if you enjoyed
data/012680.wav|i feel like azmin gold could literally shoot a
data/030251.wav|in the shower i was truly gaming it was me and
data/031955.wav|key figure of the smash bros community and me and ludwig are his friends and we were invited to roast him this is also tough you may know who i pranked with a fake
data/023739.wav|it is literally like half the cost for
data/024207.wav|well there's nothing left the culture
data/006744.wav|extra my grandmother from my grandmother
data/016247.wav|if they want to lost and it's
data/003212.wav|is that wealthy investors from other countries would act as they called them hosts or
data/006286.wav|if you want to spend that much if you want to spend that much to have a signed poster
data/017247.wav|okay because today unfortunately our justice system found elizabeth holmes guilty what happened to this country okay if you can't drop out of stanford at age
data/008401.wav|if he wasn't wearing his tuxedo
data/031275.wav|we're all they are so i try desperately to explain to him
data/020984.wav|market research firm and you can if you pay for the description which i do you can see they do
data/001482.wav|the somebody up i'm pulling up atomic bsk
data/022346.wav|i know he just turned their channels off
data/022138.wav|and i was tired and i was putting this together and i remember you have to make the email subject header before you write it and it's like on a separate page
data/015178.wav|and in hollywood and it's getting more and more expensive if you are like a leo dicaprio or you're a steven spielberg i mean
data/028302.wav|if like if if someone did ask like
data/023005.wav|at it but we're fortnite okay we're the big dogs so you give us a secret deal where we don't pay the
data/002990.wav|some kind of yelling okay i can't we can't make it out but it's it's whatever okay i think and then rochelle who's a little closer says did he say show me your hands i
data/004831.wav|i estimate his child care program looks like at his companies because guess what
data/002438.wav|right that was the big that's the big kahuna everyone always talks about it
data/004032.wav|probably not hit hear me out
data/004118.wav|it was funny but you know it's she said
data/008462.wav|equal parts insightful and hilarious cooper loop
data/010555.wav|wait mood i turned on stream in a great mood and
data/022667.wav|i like of their best uh
data/030424.wav|i'm being honest with you that the
data/014035.wav|the biggest pickups in streaming history is that
data/014836.wav|he's have been a real hot topic in gaming in the past few weeks as gamers have made their opinion loud and clear they don't want
data/028499.wav|cause i was eating the food that he bought me but anyway
data/027445.wav|i was spending millions of dollars to get her to do this
data/019049.wav|that's the secret i thought it was the fact that it's fake so because
data/000351.wav|ever heard of it let me show
data/017307.wav|the employees in america works for amazon
data/000896.wav|what's up early gang hope y'all doing well and then you left because i read your name instantly
data/004256.wav|like crazy stuff happening in china but because uh people want to
data/028502.wav|i think almost by the next day he actually thought it was pretty funny so
data/017573.wav|when that happens before you buy the item purchase
data/025611.wav|want to different funny ones but i'm saying it's mana because it's
data/003338.wav|which jobs have seen a reward which is cool
data/001893.wav|what percentage of your twitch revenue
data/010768.wav|it's like the more they feed into the hivemind of
data/017664.wav|you spend that extra amount of money on apple products and you notice the the diff difference in craftsmanship and and
data/012082.wav|out of a crew of like
data/028951.wav|i thought i was really sick because i
data/019366.wav|the business development investments your auditor must warn you that you're approaching the limit of what makes good business sense and by the way if this didn't work out we would go from a great grade to a
data/032229.wav|and let me tell you when you're doing it it feels different than when you're watching someone do
data/017175.wav|and the marketing monday awards both need to make a comeback so
data/024941.wav|it seems like melee games like cs cs 1.6 themed
data/019401.wav|we got such a high score that we unlocked a castle in the alps and the
data/024765.wav|some of the psychological tricks that they use okay that i
data/026018.wav|so yesterday was public domain day
data/026758.wav|xbox game pass now they've been secretly working on it and it's been called project spartacus and i found out what it looked like by googling the word spartacus this is my best guess
data/023292.wav|if bottles put him away off screen and
data/009847.wav|plenty of west have collaborated on music you'd
data/013213.wav|the perfect level of sadness a truck will never have smaller fingers i don't if i had smaller fingers
data/026769.wav|you guys know apple's been talking
data/020956.wav|i honestly i always go like yo actually you know what i i like backtrack
data/029076.wav|he worked at twitch when i was there
data/007941.wav|so you have to believe in it tony thank you
data/030266.wav|wait yourself with and i was like what
data/013875.wav|it's paying massive dividends for riot all of their
data/024571.wav|figure it out and we don't need to we can't figure it out
data/026509.wav|we option they said oh we picked the first one well like we want that first one
data/003881.wav|one heads that are like yeah i
data/003672.wav|you know what i'm saying the competition does not reset for the children so maybe the combination was even for
data/019469.wav|if anything that would really other than the fact that she is female
data/014557.wav|i can let you know that the
data/016767.wav|that replacement right now it's like uh
data/032129.wav|not really worth watching but that was fun i forgot about a lot of those jokes
data/013313.wav|guys really don't connect with street performers on linkedin i think you just say it because i'm against it and you think that's funny i'm pretty sure
data/010857.wav|and that guy actually i do think yasuo players secretly think
data/031808.wav|it anymore i am now officially a twitch frog
data/007368.wav|that if you have a clip even link if anyone
data/022830.wav|the shareholders will be much better off
data/017438.wav|do with my life okay sorry i'm not high my portfolio is yeah
data/027482.wav|we possible opinion has already been taken but we're
data/012541.wav|i killed the droid she would tap it and it
data/021326.wav|trends that are a little bit sad okay
data/014747.wav|by the one and only king delroy
data/021845.wav|it kind of paid off so let me talk about this so this is jeff bezos
data/027159.wav|and so what they're trying to do is talk a big game about how hard they're going to be on inflation while
data/004897.wav|i started asking like okay what's going on why do you keep buying more shares
data/020227.wav|in the website and started voting with some of the major contenders being paris singapore kuala lumpur and london with the most votes counted for batman
data/006380.wav|bowl game or like you know don't hate me but i actually like the game it's got people
data/017436.wav|okay there is no luxury of time
data/001204.wav|look nor taste like meat it was like literal slime dude it was like
data/022491.wav|well trolling they can put on their problem face and they
data/031277.wav|now try back then explaining that i'm no i'm watching koreans play video games no i'm here at
data/026121.wav|i have a chance to support these it is a good feeling because i think it is a way within the system to
data/027773.wav|which actually brings us to our main story of the day
data/024714.wav|going on but if you pretend like
data/012762.wav|do it and that guy's out there
data/021700.wav|go through a phase where you think everything i wish
data/003449.wav|graphics cards basically a company called tsmc taiwan semiconductor makes a vast majority of the world's chips
data/003528.wav|and you have to be careful with you know
data/001284.wav|the apprentice and then donald trump became president and joe rogan became like the biggest
data/006898.wav|i don't think i was ever
data/006263.wav|wow i got dinner okay wait give me a second i'm not
data/024043.wav|it and then so coke did and because of that everyone realized how much they loved coke
data/017561.wav|it does not support that line of thought
data/018848.wav|i'm sure you guys are way too mature for that I would just say even if we take
data/000326.wav|you know you can anyway so i'm in a squad with
data/015564.wav|i hate it i don't like it at all but i'm including roku because i want to keep this jungle metaphor going you know
data/000893.wav|what i'm talking about that's the
data/010965.wav|fresh minions pizza challenge where you can make a little pizza with the kit they send you and make it look
data/024898.wav|you are capable of solving that but you
data/015155.wav|successful launch of an original series of all time
data/025725.wav|we'll get shared a lot on the internet because it's interesting we're going to only attach our brand
data/021977.wav|if you don't need anyone coming in and telling us what they want to give us because basically we have everything we need here who
data/013783.wav|at portal and it was actually a good product and nobody used it because they
data/000901.wav|i gave you the world i said pick anything in this world that you want that i can possibly get user
data/012091.wav|it's like i know the fellow impossible i
data/001973.wav|i would vastly up the price um make a cool brand make them have
data/012318.wav|you know what i'm saying and by the way there was space pizza there was space
data/017867.wav|i just google it watch commercial these new apple watch ads are incredibly creepy is this it yeah like i said i don't think apple's advertising is particularly good lately i don't think they've i don't think they're out they're not
data/022200.wav|going too fast she reminds me of this ad it's like wow i don't want my dog who i love my dog like it actually works so uh good
data/002257.wav|it but didn't understand the jokes
data/023186.wav|holy moly despite being you know a youthful gen z burger he
data/002704.wav|what the hell this is unlikely we're not
data/025830.wav|that is kind of intimidating for new players league of legends
data/028483.wav|and a career in the military anyway so okay so
data/030611.wav|i told the story wait did i tell you
data/006851.wav|there's even a slightly high curb i stop and get off
data/016471.wav|as negative but some of it's actually really interesting positive and so i'm gonna talk to you mostly about where i think some things in the world are heading and i'll explain it right after this but you're gonna have to do me a solid you're gonna have to do me a favor
data/004411.wav|wins and fails i think i do i think i do yeah
data/014225.wav|enjoy ludwig's content and you have a prime and it's sitting around and
data/011334.wav|i would be tomorrow wouldn't it
data/016890.wav|at everything you're doing just gets better rewards and so people in the digital media economy are seeing massive success
data/009541.wav|he kill he has even kda
data/025871.wav|as a business reason for this it's not just
data/010728.wav|at you and me both brother but paying your
data/019912.wav|mega famous sold multiple millions okay and he started promising that this game was going to be the greatest game of all time now let me show you it has
data/009603.wav|he is the only damage and he's the only one capable of making
data/012616.wav|it took our bags to the to the uber were
data/007489.wav|at the original joe which is like a disgusting combination of weird
data/015490.wav|not fully committed and it's holding them back
data/022193.wav|i am sorry i'm sorry i'm back i'm back
data/022410.wav|geico logo and it's enjoyable it's one of the first ads i've seen

data/006629.wav|nice to stands on a couch watching that game
data/012420.wav|and then kylo ren comes in
data/023530.wav|this problem in different ways a great example of a company that is the best in the world is apple because apple has an incredibly low cost
data/028845.wav|what anyway i had to sleep there but i wanted to be more comfortable so
data/001369.wav|say something say something so i can find you
data/019650.wav|we go back go back go back back

data/024438.wav|cool use of a billboard it
data/031136.wav|snapchat's crying someone calls snapchat they're crying
data/008042.wav|and then i would say come on guys be nice and then the next time they'd be like wow he's a genius and when i got a really simple one right

data/019940.wav|why microsoft for a mere 30 million dollars
data/019053.wav|if the you guys but sometimes i get a little nervous in front of crowds you know
data/032353.wav|what's not fine is using these
data/005946.wav|but end of the day all this stuff is
data/005267.wav|she says that he didn't know who
data/026858.wav|want to give you my my opinion uh i'm
data/001944.wav|would you be happy going all in on streaming no i i
data/003645.wav|over the years which used to be very dramatic and the estate tax is one of the great resetters that makes
data/010286.wav|are dating i think that is what happened i have not seen the video but i'm under that impression so we're
data/006513.wav|i now pay later services you spend more than you would have you buy more clothes you buy more shoes you buy more travel you buy more whatever you buy more than you think
data/030026.wav|it's been having a tough time he says he says to me
data/030695.wav|i wasn't like the kind of guy who'd have
data/006533.wav|interest so you can buy things over time you understand apple's not in that business they didn't make this product this
data/024832.wav|the hero is something you can pull that can go up to five stars but also all of their items and weapons can be pulled that go up to five stars so every time you play this game there is an infinite different number of directions that you can be
data/017584.wav|in the competitors uh hyundai has an amazing
data/019446.wav|from being killed off entirely asked here
data/022102.wav|hey look they have guidelines and like you cannot show anything that gives away a customer's name except the internet undefeated found
data/006756.wav|well the funny thing to watch i've made plenty of videos roasting it and enjoying it
data/025341.wav|at the time so they were celebrating 20 years
data/003347.wav|and and loan debt and what we're starting to see if you keep a real close eye on the ball is
data/026133.wav|i was actually stoked look at
data/014168.wav|and then recently they hit on something okay this was a new development right around here when they brought over because they had courage for
data/030590.wav|mexico egypt peru or sudan easy clap probably mexico
data/030978.wav|to my closet so i could burn my nike joggers if you
data/024918.wav|so i kind of mix those two together here but
data/024787.wav|what are they have different currencies but
data/024274.wav|yeah because it's so delayed and then there's nothing clever about it really and then
data/026104.wav|sql health at risk to take a stand against a
data/030822.wav|what are you guys saying i'm not you
data/004645.wav|immediately after i get this text
data/011080.wav|yeah i wouldn't know anything about not
data/028444.wav|work on my rhymes and play it
data/029050.wav|wailing wailing wailing wailing wailing on his face literally just like i cannot let up i cannot stop punching because i know if i stop if he gets
data/005375.wav|i can't have one good interaction with a
data/025615.wav|what the counter it out the fail is
data/013347.wav|we sort of a hero for being brave enough to tell about it like i would rather be someone who had murdered someone and come clean and said
data/004239.wav|got a lot of comments like that on my youtube all
data/014400.wav|if you're a creator in the new
data/017477.wav|there i think they're raising a strike fund
data/019878.wav|phone number four let's watch the star wars
data/024623.wav|i think to sum it up in one word is is
data/018922.wav|it's meg whitman she ran for governor of california as a republican
data/022022.wav|it's big enough that an executive at burger
data/002605.wav|i have to get heads or tails from you
data/016772.wav|so we're actually literally having an extremely negative uh warped future
data/017164.wav|some pretty we got a good deal on the next run
data/027655.wav|in cash there is no way to make it profitable at current rate of growth so two things will happen one
data/017792.wav|i don't have too many of them mango has a
data/008283.wav|this is again a hello fresh by the way
data/016136.wav|get to see all good to see you all
data/026160.wav|is not dead blizzard's still innovating
data/016038.wav|in the bills so a lot of cool features
data/030935.wav|and then you learn your lesson that's the
data/024600.wav|the most important thing is it got a ton of eyeballs online in the same vein a funeral home
data/003497.wav|it's dollars in a lot of time to build like
data/019631.wav|and so i reached out to him i got a hold of
data/001740.wav|he realizes that if he if someone were to go overboard on the ship the ship would have to stop and turn around and pick them up and it would slow them down
data/018021.wav|keating literally had one card to win in the whole deck and got it and
data/005675.wav|this world everyone there is extremely talented and good
data/014613.wav|about groups now a group like
data/001078.wav|is blow my that's crazy too early you know he'll start talking about valorent and
data/030989.wav|who was very upset about it because he wanted to jack the rents
data/006830.wav|if the fun thing to do i swear to god if you like
data/017186.wav|i hated it i was so sad i was in such a bad place
data/013435.wav|if i say i don't like
data/005682.wav|my third by the way we all hung out on the grass
data/017916.wav|i feel like more of a community event so the purchase experience is different and then post purchase
data/016394.wav|under biden and they both have had massive amounts of fraud and basically
data/012746.wav|in the high pixel skyblock player
data/003029.wav|it was a shooting and the cops just literally
data/028323.wav|little mini wheat is there with his
data/016691.wav|and people that design apps i mean there's so many opportunities
data/017201.wav|my parents and i are boosting we all get it really bad yeah it's it's pretty variable i mean
data/032397.wav|for the look at look at
data/029090.wav|i would have been the face of police on twitch during i mean during
data/023490.wav|are perceived value ferrari literally limits car sales this is an actual article that i found ferrari actually on purpose
data/000358.wav|so we keep throwing down money matches 5v5
data/025471.wav|they did not get out of uh groups
data/016520.wav|to all in all for all these sports in the
data/017292.wav|this is what the author would have wanted by the way to carry on the legacy
data/021393.wav|funds were risking billions incredibly greedy to
data/019571.wav|a powerful choice like they're they're they're they have value and so you give
data/030501.wav|i can get it out but i do get it up
data/013461.wav|the times i've been humbled riding in my dorm elevator with a guy
data/032296.wav|and so you do as most humans do you check the comments because my
data/005552.wav|r rp house the same place the
data/010499.wav|it's the opposite i want i don't i'd rather have a firefly season than a community movie
data/032045.wav|with the the we can say told you cause ludwig told me beforehand don't do that joke which is crazy that i've seen his set he's like that's too far you say bitch that's with the the ludwig and say told you cause ludwig told me beforehand don't do that joke which is crazy now
data/015064.wav|i bought friends at the time
data/028729.wav|of getting messaged whatever i i completely forgot about it
data/003835.wav|it's all about picking teams yeah but you could i
data/023657.wav|amazon as the number one company investing in america for the second year in a row we created
data/006350.wav|earned and you know what let's say
data/018336.wav|what they create software for like ice and for like the military and like their biggest client is the
data/025999.wav|fake a deep voice buy a bunch of
data/026409.wav|what which doesn't do almost any pre-purchase
data/001919.wav|it's to walk away with that
data/024484.wav|are quite special because they aren't wins at all in fact it's
data/028248.wav|it was confident and they had good answers
data/007698.wav|in the gringo dude like they don't
data/017690.wav|we're shifting away from tech support they
data/023837.wav|he made me a marketing monday intro a fantastic one he also made me a song for my
data/017625.wav|please revolutionized this part of the clock the purchase part of the clock
data/009064.wav|pretend there's music playing right now
data/004861.wav|if you have going about layoffs basically he
data/000830.wav|i don't really know your history you how did you get into doing all the weird stuff you're doing like when
data/008266.wav|i'm talking about like the first wave of esports wave one people like fatality
data/009159.wav|three hours or whatever it'll be like it'll rank it by how many views it
data/016811.wav|we i think you guys all are
data/024748.wav|i would like to take the time today
data/021364.wav|if she's not an income generating asset i love her
data/026992.wav|this feels like a real it
data/017495.wav|i think it's time to actually get into the marketing monday is that true
data/021755.wav|let me just go back and just break down
data/016295.wav|well i didn't really know what to make of them
data/017034.wav|you were talking about marketing and
data/021284.wav|from today where they announced they're doing
data/028133.wav|with and invested in them lost money so nobody
data/025928.wav|marketplace and they have simply apparently no time or effort to invest in in growing and updating the
data/016840.wav|this one is ai this is
data/016029.wav|i really appreciate them for supporting me again if you want to
data/012539.wav|and or whatever and when she would tap it it
data/022292.wav|the game like smash bros melee with each other maybe they're like you know what let's get some friends
data/019909.wav|the first major big smash blockbuster super game is quake okay quake is a massive success and it makes john romero the first famous game developer he called it
data/022844.wav|lost in a single quarter the highest loss in business history everyone involved lost money tons
data/030698.wav|he's a loser like and it was like
data/005270.wav|like i didn't know what he looked like i'm just a really good
data/005471.wav|i had a actual barbecue fireworks
data/022929.wav|none of them are heroes none of them like players it's a pretty
data/004592.wav|the enjoyed it so i got my own subscription
data/005681.wav|they were all extremely aware and i
data/025941.wav|i totally no it's an amazing
data/006953.wav|and i was one of the youngest but there i go now
data/029127.wav|the office when we uploaded that when we added that while the reset was terrifying to those that watched it live the chat would soon realize all past struggles were child's play compared to the horrors that awaited them next oh part
data/015940.wav|all my thumbnails on netflix are guns
data/027814.wav|so it's kind of like we have a perfect storm of like four or five different things that all individually cause recessions or depressions and they're all here at once and the government just doesn't have the tools to do anything about it at this point it's like it's too late so
data/026756.wav|if you're right now it's very likely that multiple of these names but at least one
data/027087.wav|here's the deal do any of you guys know you probably don't maybe you do the investor charlie munger yes no yes no no no
data/003314.wav|if they didn't have good news i'm sure they're not bracing for impact on a very very bad economic report on thursday i'm sure this is a complete coincidence
data/014235.wav|so this is what they have to overcome and that is why someone like ludwig
data/023433.wav|well you probably need bro is a good night's
data/005779.wav|i'm just checking my phone and hassan
data/013311.wav|i e relationship i don't follow up
data/007452.wav|and one of the people at
data/023402.wav|the loss leader costco keeps the
data/008293.wav|i already bought a shirt for them like
data/006416.wav|really really good stuff it's always like stuff that really is actionable
data/014859.wav|okay well no actually you know what
data/011168.wav|how somewhere nag nag he's here somewhere i think
data/026786.wav|it's about meta facebook's in some real
data/005954.wav|i mean it's like people are talking about
data/011437.wav|you propose with the joker ring no i posted
data/026529.wav|where can i buy one what is your open
data/003787.wav|he is openly taking lobby money from coal companies and then saying
data/021783.wav|in these trying times we need nature more than ever we need
data/023747.wav|ten minutes could save you 15
data/019992.wav|and insane amount of merch and insane amount
data/022512.wav|the sugar and we you know like
data/021836.wav|and using them in yours okay
data/022304.wav|your brother playing mario kart with him is
data/025895.wav|like a youtuber apology it's it's like nobody
data/002701.wav|maybe you want to leave right now and go play it you don't really need to stick around do you
data/023607.wav|it's so bad sick mental illness signs worse yeah the more i've heard about this and i'm not the expert by any means mostly it's so bad sick mental illness signs worsen yeah the more i've heard about this and
data/011250.wav|yeah we got two plane tickets to texas
data/020510.wav|the chances of people falling for the
data/019373.wav|well those kids woke up to check the status of their laptops and it was like
data/016656.wav|amazon and google after 10 years it is
data/008732.wav|and so and like there's a lot of precedent that
data/000455.wav|you know like when you're at the end of the night and you're really drunk you know the next day is going to suck and
data/021063.wav|maybe we can make one person laugh and come into our store yes it will truly
data/032290.wav|you have to come back harder on monday
data/004139.wav|like not just assistant but like like
data/024802.wav|youtubers again always sharing their insane luck
data/027429.wav|there is apparently an organization called the american property owners alliance which is essentially rich landlords and they spend money on twitter ads to try and convince people that
data/016352.wav|wins and fails it is a news article that came out today that expressed something that
data/018918.wav|shrek kung fu panda monsters vs aliens okay he had been involved in these but you know what he found a partner he found a partner who knows business in and out a partner who'd never failed
data/030281.wav|and so i look at him i look at the butcher knives in his kitchen and i think i really think about it i'm like
data/005105.wav|it's been it's been so much less it's
data/026082.wav|to get the image you go to google images and unfortunately when they went to google images and searched
data/004285.wav|mixing i think you guys listened to my
data/002020.wav|the boba and the rest of it is tea you like
data/012879.wav|a good luck good luck good for you
data/021590.wav|diamond hands to explain it is the idea that once people start selling it creates a
data/010477.wav|they also kind of like ride with my vibe and do it anyway so there's no actual solution except for to ignore it completely from the beginning which is too late it's too late they're either problem facing and doing
data/007150.wav|the eight months happiest of birthdays mr hdrexter
data/010062.wav|it's because on saturday we get smarter by watching youtube videos the only way that zoomers are
data/030946.wav|and i'll write your name that's not the
data/022472.wav|if the actual people that skate so they really did their research the
data/001398.wav|if i pull up random shatters okay that's what i'll do i'm
data/016686.wav|in the middle but by 2030 about
data/018569.wav|and so xbox won that one
data/017042.wav|talking about the matrix and that wasn't even like that wasn't even the whole
data/006844.wav|it's funny because the longboard is like
data/008827.wav|elon musk is mostly known as like he's a smart
data/003102.wav|improper a amazon as the number one company
data/008582.wav|i like it it's got sentimental value and then a rich guy comes along
data/014411.wav|is worse on mobile it's a cringe experience the seamless
data/024014.wav|because if they ever did get frozen they would not be able to pay out their top
data/027842.wav|i'm not going to tell you that's leads to go up i'm not going to tell you that something's going to go up or down
data/028833.wav|the story i think i have
data/021920.wav|at posts and then i get more funny twitch
data/016382.wav|many many companies that were supposed to keep employees on with the money took the money and then fired the employees anyway
data/030335.wav|if you can do a lot with this i mean this is like the end of world war ii yeah
data/023881.wav|if the the of externalities from this but in the short term it's
data/008564.wav|and he hasn't been able to actually show any evidence that the number is
data/015661.wav|the biggest upset the the biggest chances to do super well netflix and amazon prime the biggest upset the biggest the biggest chances to do super well
data/009096.wav|my voice is not always quiet
data/027774.wav|so this is probably not a
data/020354.wav|but in san jose when we move down
data/000008.wav|to to start with i do remember so we were all walking it was like
data/029713.wav|in knew that about me knew
data/032347.wav|what's the situation that i chose
data/019573.wav|and they can say i like that one i
data/028083.wav|want to watch it it only has like 5 000
data/015355.wav|and so you just spend that money thinking it's yours and
data/019325.wav|these three girls who wanted to be apples so bad
data/031088.wav|like all right that's dope i bet you will grow but all i said was bro if you
data/032162.wav|how many other numbers could there be it turns out the most common numbers are six seven eight so i dropped
data/017035.wav|it when i could be making racks in the business world
data/008707.wav|at the day i think the number that i see like is one
data/029664.wav|i i felt for like a flicker i was like
data/003420.wav|with other governments and nations uh
data/024636.wav|if the fingers in the pulse in a more somber
data/031293.wav|i the security guard caught me i
data/009300.wav|i anything in a loot box even if it's at a
data/013664.wav|the big two me and ludwig going to
data/019763.wav|the general idea in marketing about hype is this okay hype is of course a good thing
data/012773.wav|i bet league of legends let me tell you
data/015364.wav|the money money nothing but money infinite amounts of money
data/012490.wav|anyway so that was the main long and short of it so pluses were incredible actors really committed
data/016508.wav|the seconds and do a bunch of them
data/005869.wav|i won't i won't say this you will have to not know
data/006315.wav|and then he gave me some tips on how to format for youtube and like how content works there versus three it was just
data/020309.wav|it's a at least a three but nintendo sucks
data/028795.wav|oh you're not going to tell me like this is over like this is over like you're not going to get in and
data/021341.wav|that button below i am on a
data/018215.wav|the rip it's a very creative idea to
data/009505.wav|this is over so ninja gets away but what a nice play from yasuo there saying you
data/024217.wav|the monday today is a good one the
data/016495.wav|you know let's say an average idiot who
data/001943.wav|and there's a third theory there's a third theory
data/019795.wav|i mean but then there was delay after delay after delay which by the way is giving me some
data/007036.wav|and he does commissions so if you're interested
data/018139.wav|oh my god there's a cop car on fire in a
data/026027.wav|thank you for introducing us into the wonders
data/010674.wav|i even works so it'll be one of those two and i will pull it i will pull it in in a in about 10 minutes but we got time i
data/007738.wav|josh pitt they have a two
data/016121.wav|this past few weeks have been um
data/028757.wav|for me the job that i've been applying for for months to be a content marketing coordinator at a starting salary of
data/022619.wav|in doing having trouble holding your temper when dealing with weak teammates online
data/025426.wav|famous streamer says are you seeing this
data/027169.wav|this whole discussion all goes back to sheba coin which is what i was trying to say can we print more money so we already are
data/009956.wav|your wedding why why would i do that i want the wedding to go well i don't want someone
data/019236.wav|holy moly I did not know the
data/026159.wav|if the check it out but i have to admit right now on stream i was wrong i was so so wrong
data/025882.wav|hundred times the next day and
data/011888.wav|isn't that day on everyone else showed up and of course
data/025556.wav|it because the work requires training so they got all their their
data/025652.wav|the squid game based crypto token which had a parabolic rise earlier today
data/021285.wav|doing something similar to drops in call of
data/009181.wav|oh viewership day live and it
data/021558.wav|do you think it's too late to get on
data/009919.wav|you know what i'm saying let's get
data/011277.wav|i mean that's kind of weird surely yeah just
data/008691.wav|who has done a bunch of these and he just thinks the bot stuff is laughable it
data/021532.wav|hope drive it up and they're probably
data/027219.wav|with regards to the map and
data/022893.wav|i research both apple and epic put out
data/016099.wav|your your smell you need man oil man
data/000616.wav|yeah we have to operation money launder
data/019979.wav|you're smart of him to see that value but here's the deal here's the deal boys it wasn't his best acquisition because number eight here on my list is actually more valuable than pixar was if you can believe it a marvel movie may also makes as much as a pixar movie about a billion dollars per year but here's the thing about marvel the
data/015366.wav|they they have a lot less
data/028804.wav|can reach for the stars hey
data/030939.wav|well that's kind of underground about it
data/011118.wav|we're in the middle of a conversation
data/025990.wav|you know we're going to kick of the new
data/029202.wav|i think we were trying to get him
data/020717.wav|for this series of tweets let me pull it up for you on april 6 during the height of the
data/024635.wav|beggars on the polls now speaking of fingers on the pulse now speaking of
data/002472.wav|why with the brand mission they weren't like
data/022330.wav|and because it was a new idea because it was so creative they got a ton of press coverage yeah it was genius when i was
data/008007.wav|don't want to catch up on some of the listen there's
data/003064.wav|we were like hustling you know and it's like that's my best man right there bro moment
data/029143.wav|so i i i said oh you know of course i gave
data/029415.wav|i couldn't even focus on the conversation please work please work please work
data/031707.wav|makes me feel like i really don't need to worry about whatever s3k is
data/019362.wav|and i was like jason i have the password
data/027175.wav|that let's just do what the boomers did
data/019776.wav|is because the game itself is not bad watchdog is not a terrible game
data/022733.wav|it's so they they bought it and then
data/020131.wav|it's been left it up but without committing fully
data/020368.wav|okay why wouldn't they just make it his wife character
data/031347.wav|so we get on with that i go to the judge the judge she hears the report and she kind of laughs she thinks it's really funny
data/013201.wav|that you can like pull yourself back to reality with
data/020348.wav|and then they have his wife not be you know she's not even supportive which is funny there's a lot of small choices that could have been like they could have gone safer and they didn't and that's why i'm impressed it's a good ad but
data/011828.wav|your phone i don't know and
data/000233.wav|everyone's got chips down there and they're rolling dice and if they roll well everybody wins that's the idea except
data/027903.wav|overvalued everything every asset has been in the past two years it's been hard to find a great deal nobody can get a good house at a good price anymore but thankfully i've found one and who can jump on this quickly hopefully
data/028056.wav|it's been completely shut down the last factory closed there is no more ipods this was really a breakthrough
data/021147.wav|see one guy in the back with a
data/007959.wav|topic ready for tomorrow but i'm not doing it today ready for this little
data/025806.wav|and he said for me blizzard is leagues ha ha
data/009206.wav|one of those games where you gotta you gotta play a lot bit to get better there's no there's no shortcut
data/009565.wav|as ever and they were actually playing
data/005584.wav|because the party has like 70 people
data/016218.wav|for my phone and then for these i
data/028563.wav|walk down to me tell me what i need to do so
data/026569.wav|crap out of you and guess what i got the same
data/027976.wav|all of its western assets including tomb raider deus ex for like fire sale prices of
data/014297.wav|proving to be i think fairly effective so it's down to this and i think the streaming war has now
data/021038.wav|one of the winners but they couldn't put it
data/010304.wav|i already asked him we'll see what he says
data/011049.wav|did they start do they get
data/026750.wav|it was able to buy sony they have the money sure they can't do it the money's
data/006896.wav|how many times did you die on the hill are you asking how many times i died how many times i i died on the hill knowing as i'm sure you do that death is permanent and that if i were to have died i probably wouldn't be here right now answering the question three times
data/010894.wav|hello today i am proud to announce that my stream segment is brought to you by my good friends at the minions movie rise of
data/021327.wav|including myself by the way are not creators and
data/027296.wav|it's together we are all going at different paces on the same journey we have we have fewer and fewer shared communal experiences in this world
data/010712.wav|acs bracket there is no world where you go down in total earnings
data/005634.wav|that is why it sounds like ms because every interaction
data/006587.wav|but we'll see how it does on
data/027866.wav|in fact especially great companies in a time where money is free to borrow get overvalued they get they get they get ahead of themselves the point i always make
data/002095.wav|tons of money to get cards that can play
data/004782.wav|at risk so he started to do um
data/030079.wav|hey you pikachu was coming i look at the end and then about article it's coming it's coming it's coming i'm talking hey you pikachu is coming i look at the nintendo power article it's coming it's
data/007721.wav|and the community but i don't know a lick of spanish
data/013902.wav|i had to watch it on stanz's tv which
data/011434.wav|it's it's it's it's i'm actually going to
data/008640.wav|i can just basically do it for any kind of pretext it
data/024673.wav|for one human being to know all the different domino
data/032358.wav|but believe what you want and and again i should just ignore this obviously i should just ignore this but it made me furious because of how much time i'd been
data/020192.wav|silence brad and it became a long
data/012496.wav|it was kind of short 5k
data/008151.wav|we've been disabled i thought i already did that but now i've done it
data/023915.wav|if you can like whatever but at the time i didn't like
data/031826.wav|if these two didn't exist people wouldn't even have known there was a hot tub meta that's my honest opinion i
data/024460.wav|ad campaign is really bad but
data/015322.wav|if the for free to keep that going and so that makes them unique in all streamers because they can spend a lot more money and not care and so speaking of a lot more money this is a quote from a deep dive on their new show
data/017523.wav|i have invented a something you can spam when i talk about the clock model you can say yep clock i want to give you guys a chance to be a participate you know the problem with three lines there is no way for you guys to mean so now you can say yep clock alright i i have invented a something you can spam when i talk about the clock model you can say yep clock i want to give you guys a chance to be
data/025463.wav|the first time or the first hundred times but eventually i might actually get a full day's wage
data/031735.wav|many characters is no no enemy characters no

data/029510.wav|is there anything you felt got slighted
data/014675.wav|wait i'm sorry i have one big fail that i'm
data/029298.wav|at least i think i was just a real charmer i think i crushed
data/032070.wav|get it i'll get it i'll
data/026281.wav|so this is where the yep clock model comes in please give me your yep clocks and this divides all of the interactions that
data/017429.wav|at the compartmentalize it for me
data/017646.wav|it was right the difference between this and this it shows you can you can
data/022729.wav|i the end of it in
data/012477.wav|tap me on the shoulder and
data/025655.wav|you have the clip of it crashing live please send
data/004414.wav|we yeah you guys know ahead of time so right now uh
data/011669.wav|from from when you're driving up to it
data/010964.wav|in seeing the movie is one thing but what you really want to do is try the
data/026017.wav|well off the tongue so although we did get this out of this in response to winnie the pooh ryan reynolds turn it immediately into an ad called winnie the screwed by mint mobile
data/016836.wav|in the future will see a lot of uh potential
data/008344.wav|want a burger when i'm talking to ben
data/021307.wav|viewership is starting to get really big
data/019315.wav|and i get paired off into a team of these two people the first one his name was eric i'm
data/006212.wav|this in there let's get this
data/015796.wav|you can get it bundled with disney plus

data/026002.wav|well actually doing anything get a deal with walgreens roll out your
data/022461.wav|greatness is no more unique to us than breathing we're all capable of it just one minute long unbroken shot of a guy starting his jogging regime it's such a powerful image it's such a break from what they normally do with the best
data/021279.wav|twitch prime is just amazon throwing
data/018809.wav|examples of positioning of all time they
data/012118.wav|what you in charge of this
data/012206.wav|and i make it all the way to the final round of this heat in the basement and i
data/007504.wav|and then she comes back and she's like
data/014427.wav|will snowball that can't be stopped because you use it because your friends use it
data/007006.wav|and he hands me a tall like venti
data/017680.wav|being perceived as luxury and high end and
data/002508.wav|want to skip marketing monday and be our fourth and fall guys not really but i'm also only doing
data/026902.wav|be in the news so much uh
data/031369.wav|broke child compared to what he is now making
data/011264.wav|they didn't they famously did not
data/029290.wav|and i drove from colorado to california to try and make it in esports
data/024398.wav|just spend dozens of millions of dollars maybe just rethink the concept and find a different a different concept that saves you money there's
data/005015.wav|at the personally inspect every twitter account for a bot and he was just too busy
data/026571.wav|the backtracked i am threatening you i want you to know that i
data/026593.wav|okay get a pr person stay out of the
data/013867.wav|actions though i did practice uh
data/025013.wav|i look this up if you say pokemon you're happy if you say game freak you are almost certainly mad no one has ever said good job game freak if they say
data/022772.wav|i think so there wasn't even a bidding war bro it
data/023979.wav|well aware there was no audience for
data/029218.wav|was their best player he was a protoss player from korea they had side as a carpet a waiting me to do man i'm here to help out was their best player he was a protoss player from korea they had signed i was like hot bit uh what do you need
data/012363.wav|the for like three hours but what was kind of cool is that while you're at galaxy's edge they're still sending you missions and text messages so like there's even things you can do with actors and other things i got like
data/020484.wav|this is the game that really
data/031956.wav|it was a pretty fun roast and we can watch
data/010127.wav|i can confirm that you are though it sounds like
data/005769.wav|because that was okay here's the deal
data/014655.wav|get the jpl wednesday for the
data/024241.wav|not associate with microsoft at all it's not a
data/004266.wav|if by rolling out you mean rolling up and by tanks you mean blunts then i'm in i wasn't trying to get you in was describing a situation that didn't happen but that's another way to take it r v bucks fiat or crypto there in between there if by rolling out you mean rolling up and by tanks you mean blunts then i'm in i wasn't trying to get you in i was describing a situation that didn't happen but that's another way to take it
data/021944.wav|it found in this book but i'm gonna tell you the last good thing i found and this is another thing that i use in my life generally
data/017497.wav|just in game design somebody made a version of doom where instead of fighting demons you just screenshot
data/006534.wav|because they thought it was a nice thing to do the reason they're doing it is because they know a good percent of people overspend some percent of them will not be able to pay back immediately and they'll get fat margins on the interest it's it's it's they're not looking out for the little guy here it's just obvious you just think about
data/028030.wav|as which is leading to uh
data/014894.wav|now i think that's it i don't want to do too many more i did want to give one more let's see
data/023727.wav|that i've been using for the past two weeks
data/027388.wav|it's just the beginning they also
data/009632.wav|he tries to save the turret it's not it's not i mean listen i i respect the
data/030069.wav|i need anything that's that's it and i was like i know my birthday's coming up in april i don't want a gift
data/032407.wav|as it's forming i don't get hit here it's it's i mean
data/023788.wav|oh this is a great commercial steve irwin espn commercial let's watch it
data/031523.wav|i still have my flag i got
data/004608.wav|want a minute because i i want to show this
data/007225.wav|and he's like hey i'm a little worried that like
data/006512.wav|and again psychologically that when you use
data/020063.wav|were three greatest acquisition of all time
data/030954.wav|well the words better than me
data/030650.wav|people start getting kicked out some
data/020176.wav|in the cucumber i'm sorry i know
data/019028.wav|last year and that's what's important to look at and i think what made it so interesting and uncomfortable to people is
data/008868.wav|so they may agree to a lower deal and just try to move through it the problem is if twitter agrees to sell for less than
data/014090.wav|are streaming was like oh i have to know about this every tech exec was like
data/006798.wav|he didn't have my comforting text
data/014497.wav|that man loves bagels bro if i only have one option to buy a bagel i'll
data/015757.wav|are not staying how big important is the american
data/017353.wav|don't worry about that thanks lex
data/004804.wav|for whatever reason things stop he actually
data/030240.wav|that reminds me of a story actually
data/001461.wav|or the eu prime minister that just got
data/021970.wav|or and proudly proclaimed at two minutes per
data/024033.wav|with the backlash they got was insane
data/021331.wav|do people get so mad at like stands all
data/007223.wav|he gets a little nervous i
data/006143.wav|if the thing to say lyrics been nothing but nice lyric even
data/006708.wav|hey thank you for the raid
data/008817.wav|the other the upside i guess is that you know a lot of people have said so since he started talking about twitter tesla stock is down about
data/005615.wav|and it caused a big blow up i
data/014906.wav|bowser suing another bowser doesn't really make a lot of sense and if you're a canadian who bought bought hacked switches i'm sorry
data/001381.wav|yes it's a it's a and your
data/010217.wav|if your week look like oh well actually i'm i'm watching top
data/010517.wav|i was just saying uh what
data/029063.wav|the come pick me up and you know thank god because i'm not
data/013522.wav|i am so sick of like how i grew my
data/030471.wav|we're on the beach that part is
data/025201.wav|it's the tailspin it's a negative
data/004526.wav|are you thanks for teaching me how to lose money on
data/009445.wav|if they lost remember if you're not
data/003650.wav|we destroyed enforcement and have so many loopholes on the estate tax
data/006346.wav|and that is tag yourself welcome to marketing monday on a wednesday
data/019066.wav|find me on my twitter at
data/026250.wav|private corporation there is no company that has out valued apple at 3 trillion
data/031307.wav|i swear to god we're there for a
data/000320.wav|there's like this big warehouse uh they've
data/026815.wav|this thing if the metaverse is real at all it's 10 plus years out
data/011553.wav|isn't the back that's the only that's a
data/020707.wav|so edgy this is the most
data/010270.wav|i wonder if either of them are available let me ask let me ask i think connor said he was not
data/027759.wav|the final win and fail um
data/020079.wav|it has a massive growth and it makes a
data/015356.wav|and of the year comes and a gigantic tax bill is owed and if you don't have anything saved you're kind of screwed this
data/026369.wav|and of users who have bought apple products
data/002078.wav|and then then i'll show it to the audience ligma balls okay that's
data/010824.wav|what's the most mellow game i play tft actually tft
data/010518.wav|at the tragedy it is that i couldn't get you for my
data/016554.wav|very possible that weren't before some of
data/020809.wav|and you may know me from doing unimportant things like playing children's games for money
data/002065.wav|there we go there we're talking
data/001784.wav|okay well we've locked that in
data/023269.wav|i did different bottles and tap water and i put them all
data/012295.wav|i get you know a decent amount of money and then when this guy wins right here
data/003757.wav|now it's like if you don't do it you're
data/030557.wav|because i i talked to him first he's like are you gonna tell my wife or should i and i was like no don't tell her don't
data/004564.wav|yo yo kind of pretty cool
data/023312.wav|let me give you a fail though the fail is every single one of you
data/030259.wav|the supplies and i i clean myself
data/000661.wav|big bets and coming back but on saturday when we did that we did it together and we both
data/019260.wav|card into the screen onto the screen
data/017362.wav|alexa told a 10 year old girl
data/002967.wav|this is a serious it's not a spoilers no
data/012222.wav|i you're not gonna understand this but
data/021420.wav|we got what happened today which i think is one of the craziest public scams in recent memory
data/009370.wav|we don't want him they do not want doublelift to
data/030702.wav|in the world which i didn't even know i knew it
data/031407.wav|you might think i'm exaggerating i hope you can hear my instant regret when i jump in this water
data/018566.wav|in the the handily and uh
data/021904.wav|and i don't want to work out and if i don't work out then i stay up
data/004560.wav|i'm getting a water yeah water
data/004706.wav|one month anniversary of the pop-a-thon
data/021539.wav|who has billions and billions of dollars
data/025765.wav|it can be done so my overall conclusion here is that while scary ads are often ineffective
data/006620.wav|far but at a farm four five six banana farm
data/012194.wav|in the brig and she was really
data/013122.wav|as what really gives me the fuel i need to succeed
data/030665.wav|i know how to pronounce it i've been saying bicycle but at the time
data/019853.wav|and uh anthem was supposed to join that
data/012789.wav|he's like no but i can make a strategy i'll never think of and his strategy was
data/021568.wav|what is hedging your bets hedging your bets is basically taking a bet that's the opposite of what you
data/003512.wav|i i do i think sometimes a bad job of contextualizing in the larger world
data/020839.wav|forget about ninja ninja you're nine
data/022900.wav|job somewhere else that is the crux of the argument okay and so obviously to counteract that epic
data/032167.wav|is a gambler with resolve who comes back with more money okay to fire back at them that's what that's what casinos hate the most so so
data/018585.wav|so i would say this is a very important generation this is like the most important and i think microsoft clearly realizes
data/002760.wav|if the for nothing get some sound effects in there okay
data/020616.wav|i thought there was a one in a trillion chance a one in seven
data/025389.wav|i one hundred thieves hoodie or
data/002402.wav|the rest of it to me is always a blur
data/027186.wav|indie darling but it's been top of steam the largest from soft launch ever truly truly a
data/000645.wav|they start beating us at blackjack they
data/002140.wav|even though things have changed the entire time in the
data/023822.wav|and that ad will be stop drinking tie
data/006411.wav|make money who cares about the morals
data/002457.wav|and so they make flawed consumer profiles and they often can do more harm than good because then
data/009037.wav|i have zero idea even after i started what i was
data/012798.wav|so branded mouse pads and i thought it was sick and so i was like
data/024923.wav|fucking hate the guy but i've i've been here for 12 months what am i going to do
data/002071.wav|i'm thinking though for the wedding maybe i'll get like
data/012313.wav|i don't like everything was like plated kind of well
data/006605.wav|give other editors their due i feel like
data/006681.wav|be interesting to some of you
data/006253.wav|if the thing if it's not a thing it should be
data/015127.wav|of cards it's a wild success
data/008361.wav|by yourself it's the hair i could be it
data/011393.wav|i didn't buy the five thousand
data/020636.wav|just off screen just off screen you can see
data/028935.wav|i couldn't smell it because we had a very small dorm but when i got
data/015238.wav|pretty confusing graph at first at first but
data/008482.wav|i didn't respond to that so
data/022312.wav|welcome to marketing monday on a tuesday today's topic my top five ads ever the five ads
data/015673.wav|if the the you will have massive success but they're
data/013309.wav|i don't then connect with him on linkedin later
data/032205.wav|luxury watch shop and we're looking
data/010535.wav|i think you're just you're just so busy
data/019517.wav|what i don't like it and why i think it's it seats
data/003163.wav|is kind of not happening as quick as we
data/009935.wav|there are people defending jake novak in your comment section
data/012319.wav|yeah have a picture of it space pizza like you didn't have to get it but there was space pizza like yeah here
data/023423.wav|they they live their life like they're
data/027696.wav|it's a great way to do it is public.com
data/007669.wav|and annoying minority that's what they are the only
data/017241.wav|it's ahead of my mind i think my mind can't comprehend but so that's why i gave it a
data/011710.wav|we drive we get there we get off in
data/023024.wav|basically if you capture users that can only use your platform everyone's like oh
data/030569.wav|the laughing at the absurdity of it no not belly i was just
data/017097.wav|it was like it was like this just felt really it felt like something someone who
data/017236.wav|at january because apparently it's popular for people who have alcoholism or drink too much to try a dry january to give it
data/001144.wav|i will be having the mango
data/010836.wav|i am going to be the best smite player i
data/016933.wav|we have to get involved in something that you don't necessarily
data/028900.wav|to this party i realize i'm feeling bad i need to go to the bathroom and i tell diego that i need to go to the bathroom and the bathroom maybe this is later
data/026090.wav|it's been really hanging out with other human
data/023413.wav|oh but you might have cheated
data/021383.wav|i pocketed okay it only works if the stock goes down if it goes up to
data/031552.wav|it was losing this is the guy who's losing the
data/030690.wav|the prize yet it's in my parents
data/009818.wav|the worst part is they announced like months ago they were shutting down and stopping
data/003109.wav|maybe are not included i have no idea let's see if there's any answers in the
data/020708.wav|why are life and as a marketer i'm disgusted also as a person
data/004830.wav|what this child care program looks like so i went into photoshop and just
data/028672.wav|it was all gamers gamer cred was important
data/020550.wav|what is history should i buy their stock that's a great question so that that is actually a good
data/010636.wav|it's a little emerald gassy bam i would
data/017673.wav|describing what it would look like if
data/001026.wav|is this one's kind of cute if this is your dog it's a cute dog
data/025800.wav|the game in the couch cushions and riot games just dropped two games out of nowhere they're tossing them
data/020052.wav|nothing but make me really happy
data/001160.wav|in the fridge has them and they eat them so like it's literally good it's literally it's actually i i legitimately stand by
data/001687.wav|that you can imagine i mean legitimately
data/020741.wav|and that's why the worst ad of the year
data/004288.wav|with the game playing and it's all coming out of
data/020124.wav|as for your frenemy fries for your bank teller fries for that guy hashtag fry for all
data/014036.wav|and i will say this with all sincerity almost every streamer that i know in every group across twitch whether
data/013326.wav|wait what would you change about it i think it's time to
data/017502.wav|get a little bit of a screenshot of the amount of money that you've sniped that's
data/005736.wav|i do think he's smart i think he i think he's
data/019343.wav|compute u was going for workhorse and
data/010797.wav|on twitch and and discord and everything so it they can spend hundreds of millions on it
data/022098.wav|now that waitress understandably was a little bit pissed she took a picture of it and tweeted it and people they started roasting this guy and
data/023699.wav|that's funny yep cause they always they
data/023728.wav|three things that i actually do love about these headphones number one look at
data/008231.wav|and he's sitting president has been able to win with the economy entering a recession i don't think that's ever happened incumbent advantage too strong no i
data/029084.wav|was able to create their own global
data/004217.wav|like saying nazis are bad and
data/021260.wav|he doesn't even know the name and you
data/025717.wav|when i think of scary brands there is none scarier than skittles so let's see what the masters of horror
data/000712.wav|he he it's just me and him at the table right we have drinks and
data/009634.wav|nobody likes losing a 30 minute league
data/005658.wav|just totally like she just seemed totally normal
data/004030.wav|that is a wins and fails situation and we'll get to it
data/031884.wav|what should i do bro you're
data/027926.wav|of laying people off with dignity when you're a manager an executive you have
data/025208.wav|one worldwide for like the entire day but it was all negative they're already getting milked for cash at every possible
data/001068.wav|eleven months invite your editors to the party many are saying
data/028388.wav|which i've never heard anyone use but i use it ironically all the time
data/005200.wav|like i don't care like that that's but it was
data/010193.wav|for this clip you got sprayed and said it's not so bad and
data/012528.wav|so if if i can take a vacation that like ari's really gonna enjoy and
data/026428.wav|the audience and that can work but i think
data/029028.wav|i remember what started it specifically
data/025509.wav|so this is actually altruistic what we're doing this is
data/014822.wav|the beginning so they launch it comes out into the world there's
data/003867.wav|that is dramatically hurting him the
data/030784.wav|let's say it's true and i wrote every
data/011166.wav|it's to have half this viewership is room
data/003241.wav|in your life a lot of
data/020364.wav|there's some harsher critics in my chat
data/020524.wav|is irrelevant compared to restoring the company
data/025092.wav|people will say they hate the nfl and everything they've done to football
data/004591.wav|and then they the contract ran out and they were not renewing and i was still eating factor
data/025236.wav|on sunday this is real they have put
data/012019.wav|i think of the biggest minus the biggest minus from the first day was
data/020293.wav|it could have gone harder with this scene
data/007976.wav|the for the first time a spectacular
data/024595.wav|today's wins and fails is unique
data/030146.wav|i haven't learned my lesson at all i think is what i'm trying to say
data/019640.wav|call you and see what's up and see
data/004664.wav|the office to give us a speech and like you know rally the marketing troops
data/009276.wav|well i think they took it away it was like a one day thing it's gone i don't i don't
data/007198.wav|i get there and he's already there and it's fine i
data/026825.wav|everyone tunes in everyone cares and
data/014799.wav|things apply to you i think it's a really cool app i think it's worth signing up for and also if you use it for anything i think if you just
data/016697.wav|him crazy now as the internet seemed crazy
data/010731.wav|for this sponsor but it won't start until around
data/032351.wav|it would be harder for me to beat
data/000029.wav|you guys are gonna notice it get over it my
data/006750.wav|see this and then ask you
data/016248.wav|i came across all 30 organizations every team
data/030918.wav|as your mom's the nicest person i'm
data/011648.wav|what i'm thinking is this is
data/026771.wav|and then they released that the change that made tracking opt in
data/011279.wav|do that i'm invisible to all
data/008342.wav|literally don't miss i'm literally on
data/012472.wav|cool everyone had a good time um
data/008146.wav|an expert map clear trial by bloons
data/005599.wav|it really hates cod and that he actually no i'm
data/004528.wav|of all people in the space at all i think i'm one of
data/017820.wav|these a great example amd is a great example i don't
data/008715.wav|cause i think like i said the money amount is so high i really don't think a
data/002424.wav|massively wealthy republican donators not the ceo of coke
data/018677.wav|i ended up barely outselling xbox
data/025744.wav|they get bored they don't care the second option they love it and don't remember your product
data/030495.wav|it's very very picturesque very beautiful very nice night um she looks great
data/005586.wav|deep dish pizzas like one slice is enough for one person for the night i had two slices and i was
data/024572.wav|and we don't need to and you know what they didn't
data/014540.wav|the questions or just give it a talk but i am going to end fairly soon because
data/026950.wav|it had a bunch of people take scores as they
data/005160.wav|it does look like it you just can't i'm
data/016195.wav|get a good rapport going play the song
data/022824.wav|the clip of them quizzing the ceo on why he would
data/016134.wav|my i got the you know my uh i got
data/021205.wav|will lose there was a lot of talk in
data/021298.wav|okay the pandemic was massive for twitch and youtube and
data/029040.wav|and i'm thinking in my head what the
data/006734.wav|sign anything because i just thought i know
data/029468.wav|so i leave and i remember like feeling super down i remember like that was probably one of my worst days in california when i moved
data/005206.wav|it'll make me better it'll make me stronger and so that's that's how we ended up
data/019731.wav|week this is terrible um and so i i just i i can't
data/019100.wav|called the things that like if he was
data/006173.wav|get up to him i look at his hat
data/013328.wav|i can't even trust you guys you
data/001527.wav|mr question everyone knows that if it's
data/008672.wav|it's churning out bots accounts to void
data/021016.wav|we have been ahead of their time you know to me as a young millennial
data/010695.wav|is like a person that knows you in real life
data/014695.wav|we got um stream stream elements is
data/031591.wav|i wanted to share that video
data/015240.wav|let me give you the best example if
data/014506.wav|his audience and primes would go to him
data/009952.wav|six nine six nine six thank
data/016339.wav|now that's that's three dubs but he's never had a
data/011842.wav|we got our room now again
data/017461.wav|i wonder if i have a good explanation
data/020415.wav|as the campbell's chicken soup bad
data/021540.wav|as invested in a lot of different things let's say you have a million shares of amazon a million shares of apple
data/010931.wav|i think oh yeah one free year of
data/018613.wav|at calculator on your watch on your
data/009362.wav|well over a calendar a year ago that i
data/026296.wav|for a good value et cetera
data/007344.wav|like the war was ending we were in the front row
data/008174.wav|the jungle and i'm building a quite a coterie of characters did you win a single
data/014127.wav|the numbers weren't changing they bought shroud they bought
data/017200.wav|and uh and it was way worse
data/024854.wav|you know they like progress progress is very
data/023341.wav|is less and less valuable and traditional
data/021615.wav|this is a football they don't really make
data/019372.wav|oh yes oh yes dude the quarter
data/031075.wav|starting to feel this and so i threw i threw some games to go back to like down
data/031772.wav|in good but i was on
data/025964.wav|if the company not only are you losing people
data/002714.wav|if the pushing your your luck holding
data/015219.wav|because they've built out this global infrastructure they're fighting for
data/024597.wav|is zero interesting truck ads in my entire life and then i saw
data/028574.wav|i was like dude 500 bucks
data/004569.wav|so now that you lost on twitter is it a tax
data/020412.wav|it's like a little bit off we don't like him also this guy looks forty i dunno i also think the elf could it's like a little bit off we don't like them also this guy looks 40 i don't know i
data/020573.wav|working bleary-eyed looking at the same monitor little do you know how
data/019604.wav|the german agency delivered the tagline i'm loving it and also the five syllable sound signature
data/009979.wav|we time he literally thinks that this scene after this scene he's in right this is the this is the sketch that gets
data/016485.wav|the wall street and the document said the following
data/014647.wav|let's fix this light so it's not so
data/015331.wav|it's no wheel of time because it's already out and i haven't even heard of it
data/006866.wav|did you play hearthstone i i did play
data/018435.wav|do together then they also have by far the most games uh-oh turns out
data/021034.wav|i thought that was a machinima
data/015740.wav|you will want to watch like like south park or the boys or ted
data/026297.wav|by focusing on post purchase rather than
data/002578.wav|we're gonna roll a dice i
data/029704.wav|been close to anyone that level so he
data/022820.wav|about half and so aol was like okay
data/019150.wav|but only let me give you a quick
data/011150.wav|i made like a real physical copy
data/029032.wav|what split off and me and him were in
data/027366.wav|where of your brand assets and to confirm that i decided to read a lot of interviews with me as aka himself and i found this quote that really sums it up for me that it just mean they understand it so he said we're always looking to improve where of your brand essence and to confirm that i decided to read a lot of interviews with miyazaki himself and i found this quote
data/030182.wav|and it was it was adults only because there was a drinking there was there was booze being served so you couldn't get in if you weren't over
data/024458.wav|come on board and the idea of the ad campaign is called there's so much to say we
data/022471.wav|an authentic skate brand and they realized that like if they came off as like the big corporation that didn't know about skateboarding it wasn't
data/021576.wav|we shake hands on it and i'm like
data/005939.wav|it's so good for the sport
data/016444.wav|will be forced to come work at our
data/027365.wav|then it for all their games so if it passes d3
data/028948.wav|yes our yes sir yes sir and we were at the yes sir yes sir yes sir and we were at the top of this hill
data/027112.wav|but anything else than charlie murray
data/020285.wav|he's real of course and he really does love that pepsi yum yum yum bye bye bye actually i was just speaking to him and he said um a great gift for christmas
data/003386.wav|so you know the win is that magnus
data/003047.wav|in the back we literally didn't get it back uh
data/008394.wav|well screenshots of his tweets like elon
data/025841.wav|blizzard partnered for their movie they
data/007736.wav|so i'll be posting his address here very
data/030229.wav|no doubt in my mind i was impressed
data/012571.wav|and so people have been signing up with my code and tagging the
data/001212.wav|how would you get started i guess listen um you could find
data/027249.wav|is there's a lot of ubisoft related memes because they have the
data/031803.wav|and you'll notice like there's lud
data/017469.wav|put up to try and um
data/022218.wav|the shortcuts in general i feel that's
data/021895.wav|very important to him and when i started thinking about terms of the flywheel i actually found
data/023480.wav|an advertising that's way more than
data/001996.wav|that's not the sign of good frozen yogurt if there's a guy having a heat
data/004913.wav|for a company it's not worth that much so if somebody's
data/030093.wav|it's christmas and i was like if you think i'm waiting till christmas
data/029314.wav|just been a player it wasn't like i was just like a i know
data/010820.wav|if i want to be family friendly and i should play anything but bloons if i
data/016022.wav|it can become you what would that mean i i have to get
data/021605.wav|he has a hall of fame career that's insane i don't whatever
data/010119.wav|i can tell you have a respect for underground music look at evan's tweet
data/025758.wav|this one was pretty scary i don't think a kid sees you like this rabbit if you have a white claw hey that's my dad don't mind him
data/006337.wav|so i i hope that you're ready for your interview i hope that you're gonna really you know pop the metaphorical balloon that's keeping you from success but maybe
data/015538.wav|market share only in the united states but apple tv doesn't operate globally as well as other other competitors so peacock has a slightly bigger
data/013674.wav|i don't like tube in general
data/009635.wav|i i just hope they make one overstep and
data/022388.wav|what i'm trying to say is and again i guess there was one can early on but there's
data/025148.wav|peanut butter spoons and drinking ice water
data/024055.wav|it's a millions of dollars every month to pay
data/006959.wav|for who jeff bezos maybe one pog for me
data/012304.wav|some kind of prize i forget what it was but it was like a cool souvenir or something and
data/027808.wav|tens hundreds of billions of dollars and they weren't even making money so to avoid that the government had a brilliant solution we're
data/007901.wav|and give some what you guys
data/020237.wav|be honest with you that was a good one internet
data/012629.wav|or you can never see them
data/023083.wav|is every single person in america spends about three grand a year eating out so in terms of amount of money at play here for marketers to capture it there's no comparison food is the dominant industry so you can see like every one of these chips solves the same consumer need you want
data/026268.wav|but in fact the data does not bear that
data/017232.wav|anyway i just thought that was a you know we're
data/009749.wav|anyway that will be stupid enough but then while john travolta is anyway that would be stupid enough but then
data/027993.wav|is this game to have a buggy launch now it's
data/025466.wav|are congress people pressure your local business people let's try and get gotcha game mechanics into all of our workplaces for a better and happier life
data/012977.wav|the students like i i had bad teachers for sure but i'm thinking like when i was reading this article
data/002634.wav|two hundred and fifty dollars out of nowhere if this last one is heads
data/001869.wav|an egalitarian i think it's gonna
data/030573.wav|nearly a year of the greatest stream
data/010342.wav|in the process is an unbegun
data/024527.wav|was literally spent talking about what the definition of a video game is which
data/020110.wav|the scale of this number is so high you can't really see the changes here but apple's revenue was going down so it was a company that was on the verge of death it was doing terribly so when he joined it truly did turn around a company that was feeling
data/023051.wav|money on the fortnite on the store fortnite's going to lose its you know
data/011801.wav|is what i'll say let me give you the first plus i'm gonna give you the honest pluses and minuses the first plus was that the interior
data/020804.wav|he was provided not with a script but with certain talking points sure why wouldn't you give someone some talking points he told me he would read the talking points on one condition that i didn't watch his video beforehand so i haven't seen what we're about to watch now he knows who the winner is so hopefully he delivers it correctly hopefully he doesn't say
data/003254.wav|yes this is what i want every single possible hobby should be
data/015318.wav|in your toothbrush sale business and your book
data/000394.wav|as the bachelor party ever i'm not
data/031084.wav|i said he'll never have more than 2k
data/010591.wav|and there's probably only one power in the world that could save us the power of song and so maybe just maybe
data/008796.wav|this is very unlikely i think a the world's richest man going to jail is unlikely come on what country
data/010024.wav|your videos ready if you've got videos one out of ten huzzah hooray
data/000521.wav|and we open the big wide doors
data/024989.wav|so i'm noticing california it's uber which is funny that we quote unquote hate uber even though like there was a chance to finally make them pay their workers and they just spent a little money and
data/009795.wav|when you know what i'm saying
data/027210.wav|it paid off quite handsomely so if you look this is the sales figures for all their previous games middling to no success they had adventures of cookies and cream was their best game from
data/026612.wav|welcome to marketing monday on january 18th that means yes it is a tuesday
data/015090.wav|the more so um here's a
data/022991.wav|microtransactions and we're not getting a cut of that because back then the app store didn't care about that it was only for the initial download and they said we'll have to make sure
data/020481.wav|twenty million copies this game did not sell poorly this game
data/002942.wav|like the movie did like an hour and a half of explosions and shooting and then
data/001159.wav|because they haven't got a sponsor yet so but they literally they eat it
data/012394.wav|as make their move like they have enough
data/019307.wav|years old probably i in general spent most of my college time
data/018833.wav|if the team came back and he thinks about it and it looks gross and he looks at
data/016252.wav|that of his contract lmao and
data/002418.wav|many moons ago you bought the money
data/011969.wav|there's the good guys the resistance were like hey let's let's get these stumped off the ship was high these fucking cargo it's like do there's the good guys the resistance where they're like hey let's let's get these stormtroopers off the
data/006689.wav|if i had hair like this i'd never wear a
data/009782.wav|they're doing a lot of stuff
data/028256.wav|know somebody who worked directly with this person they made one mistake in their interview explaining the team they worked with and i was like wait i
data/011202.wav|as that's why i'm so impressed wait i
data/010337.wav|power for school and for gaming i've been trying to get michael reeves i don't i
data/029576.wav|yeah especially for people who aren't you know hyper competitive at the top level mainly can know the nuances just
data/027376.wav|a similar model and that is make sure the old rich power people are looking
data/018492.wav|i always have one powerpoint that's
data/029590.wav|his performance and how he really kind of didn't have the
data/000691.wav|a slide the thing back and the entire real restaurant is entire is behind it we
data/003105.wav|by what metric fun by what metric
data/023438.wav|the version of the senior level
data/020421.wav|bold of you to assume i'm sorry most of you aren't snowmen there's a lot of good coke commercials
data/021140.wav|if you're a baskin robbins this ad is polarizing and not what you need you already have a big established
data/021560.wav|it could literally shut down trading tomorrow what's the best time to sell well if you
data/026089.wav|some data has come out showing that gen z has the lowest usage of drugs and alcohol ever cringe embarrassing sad losers no drugs no alcohol no sex
data/018059.wav|it out the refreshing taste of pepsi
data/024164.wav|what's friend he knew to join him to help pump the numbers up and so his two streams back were
data/004394.wav|you know there's no it's a ps is for a
data/018436.wav|this is why this circle here is why this
data/007998.wav|both directions by the two most important
data/026251.wav|and i want to give you a second to visualize what exactly a 3 trillion
data/002580.wav|right now just for saying the word
data/018252.wav|this guy's face this is my reaction
data/026545.wav|as a good feature for users how can we build
data/003740.wav|well as bribery it's like company donates a few hundred thousand dollars to a politician and then suddenly they're doing things that are positive for that company
data/004287.wav|and i think you have it
data/030072.wav|i want is in november or whenever this game comes
data/009254.wav|and so yeah we'll do a happy crunch miss kind of thing and i'll just buy a bunch of games for
data/021767.wav|to do some people have been interested in did you see people have been interested
data/030926.wav|and they're in three boxes on a wall
data/009251.wav|around the holidays and i did marbles and i just bought
data/012585.wav|was on disney and i felt like it was good omen
data/009124.wav|god damn it maybe i can combine
data/027987.wav|someone will tell someone and then when they try to stop that
data/019140.wav|but then I realized none of that
data/000573.wav|i was the idea that was the sunday plan get high
data/002718.wav|but you said you wanted to push it
data/020383.wav|i see today this thing is i mean this part is smart for
data/016214.wav|there's nothing i can do with that
data/031105.wav|that money i i literally know that i i remember telling
data/024424.wav|what's been done so i want to show you this jeep billboard from i believe the
data/012933.wav|i didn't know how to explain that then i didn't i wasn't i didn't understand the business side of it enough i was
data/028560.wav|did that that's in turbo tax right
data/018734.wav|it has amazing margins it makes a ton of
data/007850.wav|can you believe it today's marketing monday is actually
data/030311.wav|but i was outside the system
data/026970.wav|it feels like it played right into every
data/003234.wav|get earn anything they turned a web three game into a
data/006987.wav|i but i also have um
data/002461.wav|i remember was that they looked
data/018932.wav|targeted at zoomers now i don't want to
data/013720.wav|i made a map about hitler he uploaded a bunch
data/030761.wav|i was getting call after call and each
data/001769.wav|aren't they making a new one probably i mean everything we've ever
data/016236.wav|in today's topic i'll just tell you ahead of time today's topic is about the future it is about things that are going to change the world and perhaps
data/024076.wav|to right in a daylight like this this taco bell actually the kitchen sits up on a second level and then it has essentially four kitchens in that large kitchen and
data/016336.wav|he canonically in north korea invented the hamburger that's awesome we all own a debt and
data/025387.wav|at walmart i would get it and then i scrolled up and saw their 60 bucks
data/026007.wav|they have of many many crimes and likely uh will
data/022721.wav|you know this iphone thing that came out five years ago it's doing pretty well we should get in on that so five years after the iphone they decided to make their own they thought okay we have to get into that game mobile's getting kind of big and so
data/025057.wav|it's the four big tech brands of the world so
data/005870.wav|if your stuff a lot miss giff was basically going around the
data/029245.wav|is off the charts starcraft is truly production values and it's all
data/032133.wav|weekend though i will say in the great war between me the player and my enemy the casino a battle was lost this weekend the
data/009854.wav|in terms of land and build gigantic sprawling parking lots in every direction
data/019665.wav|i recorded it on my phone
data/022117.wav|we're going to get to this together my friend
data/019378.wav|learn from us because they wanted to get better grades and so they they started to look at what we were doing which is why i had carefully named all of our products incorrectly now let me give
data/031887.wav|well you got your phone behind your date's head and you're actually watching
data/028742.wav|the friends from high school with loves league funny story about lorenzo heat at one point had the most called ma games have any human being a why the friends from high school who loves league um funny story about lorenzo he
data/026278.wav|fact this number is actually going down it's not like
data/017591.wav|purchase this is like in-store it's like
data/028509.wav|or how to sell stocks which is a good thing
data/024352.wav|well the tipping point from 07 that
data/027879.wav|so you're young startup person you can buy that
data/008629.wav|so you know it's it twitter does get
data/005884.wav|subtly there's unique differences and it was i think
data/004550.wav|wait over there dude wait for your turn
data/016458.wav|they cut it out wayne wayne i
data/016852.wav|so many industries i can't even
data/017725.wav|we're just marketing that makes you feel more part of the apple ecosystem once you buy an apple product you get access to the blue
data/005313.wav|sit down i'm sitting next to jarvis if
data/022224.wav|i couldn't imagine me and my

data/026725.wav|and there's great games that could come out of blizzard on a larger scale i am very deeply afraid of monopolies and i'm very worried that gaming which has been a very competitive space as we trend towards consolidation with big companies buying up more and more of the market that's scary that's where things go
data/003483.wav|word girl yeah yeah yeah we're
data/022832.wav|so instead of owning all of a big media company he gave up over half of his company

data/013297.wav|the best man he already told me
data/014150.wav|cut off by just months instead of getting massively paid like pokey you're getting nothing you're getting absolutely nothing because
data/023273.wav|right so i cheated i cheated and i i changed the label just so i could get her just like a get one over on her because she was like being so smug
data/014126.wav|a single exec started to realize that the
data/019021.wav|is not going on a talk show or being in a movie you can be famous through essentially static images and that's easy to do you can make a
data/018543.wav|owning bethesda is part of that their goal is to dominate the cloud and they will stop at nothing okay
data/007841.wav|smile i'm using you in a powerpoint
data/032078.wav|i was trying to get a good night's sleep so i could do a good roast the next day
data/015432.wav|marvel's massive they own that no one
data/003952.wav|you know and i think they can cross the aisle
data/024677.wav|newspaper released a statement on friday saying that evergrande is not too big to fail implying they will let it fail implying that we may be due
data/032230.wav|where i'm like wow what are we doing and i watch him take fifteen hundred dollars the atm was not far from the table i think stan's told
data/010771.wav|if the for parts exactly exactly
data/005593.wav|we had some pizza here that the whole
data/021867.wav|i say okay eventually i'm gonna get
data/021213.wav|inside of people are for these shows so you'll notice a few shows are worth like hundreds of these average shows so like the boys the mandalorian the crown westworld these few
data/019929.wav|but this is the first time we had a famous developer tell us he was
data/005710.wav|cole cassidy guns and uh everyone else in the group other than
data/017233.wav|you're off right with some terrible brand tweets
data/011963.wav|an rpg it's like it's like
data/027547.wav|and they like their cushy position they want to keep it that is more likely and that seemed to be the reason they were fighting tooth and nail to stop
data/002371.wav|if the content that's cool i haven't streamed in a couple days anyway i've been sort of in and out
data/029433.wav|i really liked me if i did one thing right it was like get on this guy's good side and like convince him that i was a hustler trying
data/029483.wav|but he didn't give me internship but he gave me that email and again it was just an email
data/001403.wav|i have a zero tolerance policy on stream based trivia cheating
data/031314.wav|in the back they have the cashier in on it in a
data/020251.wav|because an ad lets you use positive things for free you don't have to pay ryan reynolds millions
data/001045.wav|is there so you can just figure it all out i'm sure it'll be no problem
data/002037.wav|what in relation to what are you talking about when you say
data/010920.wav|or like you know put it together it's a
data/026197.wav|i think it was that great i thought it
data/011827.wav|is from the future it also like reminds bitcoin on your
data/006503.wav|if the the of those companies
data/020363.wav|at any given moment is seemingly arbitrary the final nail in the coffin is the lack of any form of yellow tree topper to complete the picture two out of ten and that's generous
data/017839.wav|this is like the game awards it's like advertising
data/022327.wav|one of the things i learned from this is about earned media whenever you make a like if you are a brand and you do something on your own social media it's called owned if it's big enough and
data/014326.wav|the office they had everyone else's
data/019504.wav|it's just a picture of a logo but the idea is that every time you see it it's more likely to stick in your brain
data/007057.wav|and he worked in like music you know the whole thing felt like i was talking to a
data/020577.wav|that's poignant and wise all they need
data/014865.wav|millennials are gonna have a real great next 10 years the next
data/017489.wav|which is which is really nice

data/026687.wav|games from twitch now again this is this is
data/029323.wav|what impressive i am wearing this this
data/016565.wav|these lines are public and private universities massively increased while wages have stayed basically flat which means every single year universities get more and more expensive now this is obviously a negative thing by any metric but it also represents opportunity there has never been a better time for a disruption to education people are finding new ways to learn i mean
data/030231.wav|i was remember that we didn't get enough of the video this is the general idea right but this is not the part of the thing where i have on his leg that that is how the piss story
data/028931.wav|and i have a big smile on my face and i feel good and i look over at diego and i'm like yo what happened last night like did i throw up and he gives me what i think is the very
data/012155.wav|in trip we don't have a droid i felt
data/031795.wav|and the king of that out of nowhere in this past month has become aiden ross who actually is
data/014064.wav|yeah exactly um auto is a rare one and because of
data/024141.wav|they had a lot of money to throw around
data/027650.wav|it's all of the shares he's buying my shares this is just for him but as a company it is no longer
data/019513.wav|was so successful that it actually

data/005556.wav|we were we were there again we showed up
data/016800.wav|as it's not necessarily like middle classes we'd think of it but

data/014962.wav|which is nothing you know five dollars a year
data/016873.wav|this one is relevant to us right here right now and this one actually had
data/014584.wav|no that's not that's not what they're doing um and also youtube
data/022236.wav|put a movie on for you

data/016480.wav|a 30 year old wall street
data/021976.wav|piece of advice to aggressively stop unions and treat your workers pretty terribly here is an ad that ran on twitch tell recently when it was shut down
data/003306.wav|because as of yesterday the white house put out a new definition of recession
data/017941.wav|i'd have to do more research
data/010635.wav|i would have thrown a little bit of spice a
data/026325.wav|re times as much on advertising as as apple an apple store costs about nine million
data/024165.wav|was like him lupo tim courage and so youtube and twitch
data/017802.wav|model that other people maybe not could learn from or replicate to sell more subs
data/024235.wav|former nfl players steve gleason of the new orleans saints and that cost money
data/019280.wav|that title to be available at launch because when a game releases is the peak

data/014244.wav|watched they have big events they have esports but
data/030378.wav|that i go in a different line from her okay
data/022962.wav|at fortnite and that is the rest of their company it's not even
data/008486.wav|we can and then i'm gonna
data/009814.wav|i'm sure that it will all work out fine
data/016845.wav|you know moore's law and uh and it is
data/025069.wav|which is nothing to nestle and everything to ethiopia nestle makes a billion dollars a year on
data/021637.wav|from a marketing perspective they showed
data/002651.wav|it's a win potentially infinite dollars who will take home this incredible prize this phenomenal prize by the way thank you for the five months ceo of
data/001011.wav|well one thing i want to say about maya is that she can't get enough of factor
data/026157.wav|if you guys know marketing monday you may know that i put out one of my favorite marketing mondays ever
data/001433.wav|we very restrictive no cheater okay here's the question what is the name of
data/026397.wav|loop bubble club these are all parts uh
data/023336.wav|i want to show you an example that just
data/014313.wav|would almost never be worth it for someone like ludwig to go to youtube let's say either side didn't pay and it was just like let's go to the platform that's better he might be like okay youtube's got some
data/011655.wav|crisis i called ludwig and stands and said yo i think this might torpedo the whole world economy i'm selling everything now hey by the way that
data/020105.wav|the fort for a little bit and then he held it out until he died once he was in
data/004735.wav|at them out at any cost
data/010981.wav|which one then immediately the other
data/025521.wav|if you recall in my video back in january i predicted that
data/026802.wav|nobody really wants to work there unless they get paid exorbitantly nobody's dream is working at facebook right now it's like their top talent

data/015817.wav|him the money to make the show he makes the content they release it only on on netflix instead of
data/019756.wav|the capability of becoming the most
data/003184.wav|is right at the time that the government is finally growing a pair of balls and kind of pushing some regulation on them right as they are already faltering so
data/008457.wav|impressive of the time out of bounds really
data/010191.wav|i just really bad i started
data/018598.wav|i decided they're thinking about it i'm certain i'm sure
data/007263.wav|if the the crowd and he points to me and it says give me
data/019322.wav|as a kid you would have heard of enron
data/031845.wav|his hair and ninja's not in it
data/009751.wav|and in the gang nicholas cage with no face wakes up in the hospital murders all of his guards finds john
data/006789.wav|i was texting him i will say this
data/007385.wav|if the reddit community really hated mango for
data/009046.wav|or legs trying to get into fall guys and don't want to time out and try to figure it
data/004050.wav|if streams congrats now remember once you make money streaming a lot of what i'm

data/006914.wav|an addictive substance it should be classified i think if i started smoking and i started playing balloons at the
data/029417.wav|but that guy had a good rapport and
data/017007.wav|i think i'm happy with it and we got
data/004729.wav|it's the same strat one more time
data/028773.wav|what are you making now they want to know exactly what you're making now so they don't offer you too much more they only offer you a little bit more and
data/017306.wav|society because now one in every

data/032378.wav|what radiance and i clicked radiance this is why
data/008501.wav|it was it read quickly it wasn't it wasn't too much
data/014608.wav|if the on specific generally youtube has a lower
data/018552.wav|to run out before you see any updates i'll tell you that
data/009237.wav|i was like eight years old i cried i cried

data/019630.wav|that would actually be such a
data/008589.wav|so good and so much better than what they could get elsewhere they would basically be sued by shareholders like me if they didn't take the deal because
data/031836.wav|them from a video for a while they're really good i mean like they got a lot of victory royales i don't

data/025268.wav|if the topic will be about mainly i want to do
data/003144.wav|that she didn't like snapchat and then the company
data/008560.wav|that you don't like before you buy elon musk
data/028797.wav|so i crack and i'm like i'm
data/028965.wav|i am ahead of me and i don't i don't know what i'm going to do
data/008207.wav|say on that or do on that um
data/025799.wav|to dethrone it and that's just one thing they also surprise dropped
data/005543.wav|the i was like i have
data/006455.wav|and get it before it hits the and get in before it hits the moon uh
data/031415.wav|i underneath the house is like a beach that is basically owned by them and the neighbors
data/026555.wav|one that job you know if you haven't tried
data/010409.wav|well obviously better than one even if there's two at least you get some kind
data/023427.wav|as i've seen of success with the people that i've met like
data/000562.wav|with the rooms and he says hey your friends aren't gambling we gave you these rooms
data/019279.wav|great title that was exclusive and you don't have a lot of exclusives on
data/022340.wav|is it out and tells you that sticks in your brain and it became like this viral moment there was like
data/016477.wav|that will launch me in the rest of the
data/018843.wav|marrying someone else that's not a crazy thing
data/016313.wav|with the other corporate warehouses to number of injuries per employee and that is awesome you can't be these are
data/003745.wav|you have to break the law you legitimately
data/031162.wav|you're literally watching him live a healthy
data/010223.wav|all right man well good luck if you have
data/001704.wav|this direction because i don't think i i have
data/027225.wav|a different approach to the concept of open world but it can be said
data/007537.wav|expecting a and by the way i have my
data/028293.wav|openly call out the ceo in front of the entire company week after week so it would be like
data/025673.wav|without breaking social norms while the other one the shock value one often
data/002117.wav|it might see the biggest number of third-party
data/010510.wav|well you wouldn't you wouldn't paint everyone
data/016633.wav|and i don't think it's because of our sex appeal
data/028490.wav|i can tell right in that moment my dad
data/019013.wav|basically promoting a new champion for
data/013995.wav|we do have to pay later
data/000037.wav|very mixed up country though you know different parts some part of canada that just speaks
data/021696.wav|what's the world know where you're
data/001019.wav|is that fair because you've talked about it
data/019868.wav|the point of this i'm making every single
data/023676.wav|okay i must look very petite today
data/014317.wav|if you miss something you can easily click back
data/011899.wav|so what you really want are people that are kind of into it so that when you look around it feels like you're on a ship because
data/013587.wav|that i don't condone and don't support
data/003546.wav|i grew up on dumerism as
data/001646.wav|more discord messages that i that bury the real ones i need to see from like pay but this is a cute
data/002826.wav|a legal battle brewing between twitter and elon musk and uh the big debate for the first
data/006705.wav|it's not a problem but it was a problem because
data/027045.wav|but i want to tell you so ari is a really big
data/020291.wav|i yeah uh yeah let's let's lock that in it
data/015861.wav|it's kind of early days for them
data/010224.wav|give me a heads up so i uh i can make
data/032323.wav|do a whole rant about the holonet community
data/002025.wav|with the boba and you saw
data/027326.wav|it's probably one of the number one ways in the world in all of branding to create
data/011907.wav|in khakis in a shirt or something worse
data/004995.wav|our breakup fee that's not he can afford it not terrible decent for twitter
data/026742.wav|the next slide that's really important you might notice it's blank
data/029281.wav|today streams are all equally as big as ddp
data/017761.wav|way more subs than me and in fact
data/009780.wav|expecting to they have to hard cap temperatures in households so you can't have a temperature over like i
data/030178.wav|i won but then this is where i lost and this is where this is where ludwig
data/004053.wav|if you do is be ever vigilant
data/024361.wav|you're in there somewhere there's not
data/014327.wav|why did they just spend money okay
data/024015.wav|say something bad press can cost you some of your creators but
data/002341.wav|well hello hello hello hi hi good to see you
data/021253.wav|he had a video where he put a
data/024812.wav|and the fact is if i wanted that skin and couldn't buy it directly but had to buy 60 packs or
data/030260.wav|the of the shower feeling like a million bucks i've never felt bet alec
data/005357.wav|so i assume that he's head nodding
data/013349.wav|in the murder then somebody just was innocent the whole time
data/014720.wav|let's see what the clip is dude
data/020961.wav|the most arguments because you're wrong about most things as most people are because we're all
data/023977.wav|which is terrible that's not a business that's like a  that's like a bad youtube video
data/027962.wav|the be replacing justin lin who you probably don't know by face or name but he did create magician movie now you see me which famously has quote unquote magicians performing actual magic it might actually be good because that kind of cheesy
data/000328.wav|and it's cool there's like elevators i
data/029369.wav|i think i'm pretty good in situations like this i'm not i'm not super awkward i think i do stupid things i'm very stupid
data/016102.wav|is our economic ecosystem i didn't teach
data/007811.wav|seen a lot of shark tanks
data/021565.wav|what do you think will happen to canadian brokers
data/029947.wav|because he gets he gets torqued he
data/027694.wav|anyway I thought this is a fascinating
data/022477.wav|your research to really understand who you're talking to
data/024224.wav|this extra money because you could shoot a very cheap ad that has amazing viral
data/025360.wav|would disqualify me and they were like oh you
data/031750.wav|you do not need to say
data/015798.wav|andy monday or too expensive good question they offered but too expensive do you post marketing
data/004452.wav|i sub can drink shouldn't but it can
data/024536.wav|points were shot down they were not
data/019347.wav|it before anyone else because in this presentation i say the quarter six gambit the quarter six gambit this is from
data/032194.wav|money on craps we went to a game called
data/026199.wav|there's nothing to get about i'm
data/000971.wav|start of the hangover okay if it ends up beating the
data/014545.wav|i do i think he likes the freedom i think he gets paid per project he's also really
data/024030.wav|they need to keep paying out the 90
data/023763.wav|more records but but i'm the best but are you a
data/019632.wav|i texted him earlier he gave me his actual number i want to see what the story was so i'm
data/025755.wav|start marketing monday on like um
data/015086.wav|in right it was a disastrous split
data/023194.wav|add some grass when they were small and now they're in like this factory problem but
data/028172.wav|it's paid 3 million dollars in salary so i
data/006551.wav|huge growth rates and the things they use it for most are clothing
data/017658.wav|it can create a story that is not a typical tech ceo outlook especially back in
data/027958.wav|have the best one in my heart yes
data/016184.wav|if you want the outcome none of us would be here without come you know what i'm saying put that together
data/025095.wav|as one of the lowest net promoter scores
data/017173.wav|which means we are due for a couple things
data/001464.wav|well i don't know why none of our allies
data/016614.wav|wait for someone interested in working in this industry or
data/021270.wav|as and they're calling it views it's not real youtube has seen steady growth and growth at actually a faster rate than
data/011576.wav|but this is the real star
data/018629.wav|was mixer flopping they really planned on mixer doing better so they could have they could own the
data/023013.wav|it's amazing reviewers they didn't notice it and the secret code after a later date triggered and unlocked a new store this
data/007366.wav|you know just a euphoria in the crowd
data/018357.wav|san francisco which is way below market
data/016730.wav|if the shoe it's actually a massive benefit to the
data/006506.wav|way of saying debt and is literally design i mean as a business you know they say things like okay you can split this payment
data/030653.wav|in the five and my dad shows up to pick me up
data/008699.wav|the the process they did was fraudulent like that
data/010161.wav|are fans of the charity why do they want to see you get it looks so painful and miserable yeah it was
data/019031.wav|was a bridge too far for a lot of people
data/007930.wav|above and beyond like grad photos yeah
data/020658.wav|performance as gamer on tractor can we watch that one more time
data/012782.wav|so i'd be like yeah we could probably we could probably get a team together
data/023282.wav|i literally couldn't do it but i i will say some people can a hundred
data/013080.wav|and then re-watch it until you learn it it's
data/007748.wav|is there anything that happened that has your unbridled
data/025576.wav|because this man mark zuckerberg is now in charge of how we connect with each other
data/018036.wav|one has to ask themselves why is pepsi
data/008430.wav|it could be a funny youtube video
data/007266.wav|where did i stop where did i cut out
data/010646.wav|in fact today i'm just gonna be playing minecraft let's plays and i'm not
data/005302.wav|am i guess that's something that's happened
data/014893.wav|pretty serious changes to make it better for players so um yeah
data/031568.wav|even if you're the greatest macro
data/028021.wav|i have been talking about for a while on what's going on
data/016701.wav|it has continued um people used to live a lot closer to
data/001163.wav|microwavable meal and i've had a bunch because i'm lazy i just
data/010749.wav|it out but like it happens too often it's broken and so i can't it can't be trusted
data/010832.wav|which is also awesome so it's kind of a
data/026773.wav|what of businesses that relied on uh ad
data/014942.wav|my friend and yep that's it okay step one do you
data/024333.wav|or the description for this ad is when british insurance company norwich union changed its name to
data/005406.wav|yeah i wanna i wanna like i mean youtube's very rewarding in a way that twitch is left which is fun
data/025733.wav|at the for candy kids and don't they not want to be scared yes
data/013192.wav|well sticks what a terrible terrible username moist mozzarella sticks
data/017643.wav|opening a new store verizon spends four hundred thousand
data/023512.wav|so i mentioned that this is the average age of ford users
data/007675.wav|i was trying to i was brainstorming last night ideas and i
data/029796.wav|tag along with you and i remember talking to
data/027670.wav|make twitter very profitable very quickly let's see what that is
data/013565.wav|but i didn't think about it
data/022394.wav|is phenomenal and i think about
data/008744.wav|love me tender and tender is the night
data/019698.wav|well let's talk more in the future sure
data/008812.wav|i mean look twitter is damaged i i i think people that think elon is playing
data/030183.wav|me and ludwig just being competitive are
data/020044.wav|it's very unlikely that if this deal were to come by today
data/012530.wav|i don't regret it at all for that reason alone but i'm just talking about it was
data/020978.wav|this this article from a respected uh from
data/009106.wav|whiplash dude plus you don't know what i'm gonna say i open almost every stream with a steady
data/006817.wav|yeah prime you can watch it with me live i'll probably do like an episode a day
data/014185.wav|if they are not negotiating on
data/025835.wav|the cinematics and that is an incredibly brave decision they didn't want to let somebody who had more movie experience but no
data/027874.wav|are terrible they're just bad people die people lose their houses people are fired
data/000237.wav|whether it's the entire casino friends and strangers against my brother
data/031934.wav|because we were all going home you know our parents were expecting us but like everyone else wants to go home some people had a bad night at
data/007132.wav|get them out it was crazy it was crazy
data/003276.wav|reforestation company accidentally started a major forest fire in spain but what's important to know is
data/028652.wav|at diamond supply co all right
data/017439.wav|yeah it was a good one
data/029539.wav|in rules smash four is gonna
data/017524.wav|if you participate you know the problem with the three lines there is no way for you
data/031794.wav|this is like where people that play call of duty and open packs and chill and say w
data/031873.wav|just like how crazy impactful amaranth
data/031588.wav|this is the most dominant player in history with the last chance to
data/019165.wav|are you know what I'm saying like that's
data/019243.wav|weirdly racist and I it's bad
data/001472.wav|trudeau was the easy one i i figured
data/010647.wav|gonna stop and i won't be cursing
data/026885.wav|not particularly bad it's not egregious
data/028183.wav|deep dive on the world of
data/028033.wav|which of the profit it's good this is all
data/004939.wav|what i'm getting out dude this
data/013020.wav|and i feel like you're retains
data/025149.wav|that's the most unrealistic part of this
data/005929.wav|and finally finally someone has invented a new strat to counter it pop off first get
data/025902.wav|when this article came out they followed it up with
data/015033.wav|it's a month and no late fees 22
data/019037.wav|was disgust i mean there's people that were like really pissed about this there was people going hey don't
data/031499.wav|if the than the top chess
data/024631.wav|which means yet again i was right
data/018316.wav|in rocket fuel your startup's doing amazing and you want to go public it's called
data/024025.wav|i just the banks and make the banks okay with giving them the clearance to get the money they need okay they were trying to make it seem like there's going to be nothing over the line here just pure
data/027058.wav|we're talking about they're just doing unrelated bold things
data/025021.wav|the iron curtain of ubisoft is hated across all of europe and i think that's pretty pretty accurate
data/013162.wav|yeah that sounds fun straight up playing the
data/000116.wav|for you there will be i will fly in the finest sushi okay vegans can eat sushi yeah i've been fooled yet again if you're
data/021255.wav|and i was checking out this video and he had a clip
data/026557.wav|in the paid mechanics which is shocking given its popularity again this guy could probably sell
data/022852.wav|and i i found out he had done
data/029623.wav|climax the climax what i can gather the
data/029799.wav|that's how i knew you going in but when i would go to tournaments
data/019406.wav|eric will present our key takeaways and then eric just like literally like
data/008922.wav|with my one phone call do i get that
data/004899.wav|how about we let you buy up
data/030204.wav|we clear no you didn't to be clear i have
data/020143.wav|i have a bookmark try using oreo
data/031510.wav|i think this is it okay
data/009087.wav|hold hold no we're not doing
data/027544.wav|with a lot more money and there's two reasons one is that you think the management is doing such a good job that this will naturally go up
data/023850.wav|actually think the design is fine but where they're getting into trouble is that they change the taste and so there's beginning to be a backlash from i mean people that like coke zero sugar apparently and diet coke and all those really like it so what i'm hearing is they might be getting into a new coke situation now i think the new
data/018049.wav|this is how japan sees america
data/028644.wav|and i grind and i get it
data/018399.wav|other streamers are probably getting bounties
data/018874.wav|i read it read it read it write
data/002350.wav|if the to clip channel please check it out it's basically for you pick one i'm in a double relationship because i get if the to clips channel please check it out it's basically for you pig goon
data/009868.wav|you still need car though but to get between places it's also like the entire
data/015222.wav|got a lot of talent let's say
data/021805.wav|it belongs in only a single category that was created for this actually was
data/026048.wav|if they create jobs for it's
data/016107.wav|that trend research is half the battle because you think my name is
data/019542.wav|oh better than the harvey's one and i just can't so bite bite sip sip
data/012382.wav|the entire time you've been talking with all the characters that are created for this ship none of them are from star wars movies they're all like lieutenant croy's made up
data/007925.wav|i i don't recall you wouldn't rent a tux right for
data/009348.wav|we'll do it i kind of discord him about it
data/020668.wav|do we do a lot of things
data/025318.wav|you when you've flipped your jpeg
data/016734.wav|as progress is made i mean i know that um
data/022940.wav|i don't think i mentioned this before
data/031601.wav|for this event when they said accommodations they meant a hostile with the tiniest
data/018808.wav|with the creative one this is a five when it came out it's very pretentious this is
data/030930.wav|the job i took the fizz
data/001716.wav|his short stories are dark he's a good writer but you'd think when
data/021600.wav|accounting reports that were completely made up saying
data/009233.wav|but i remember i kicked it really hard once trying to do that and i didn't move my other leg in time so it just flipped
data/007122.wav|that masks were no longer required and it's like okay look i understand that we're two years into a pandemic
data/016330.wav|as out there that just can't miss
data/009585.wav|well they are actually playing it like they cannot lose and they just keep diving deep into the jungle with less numbers
data/022239.wav|an ipad i get it the parents don't care it's for all of you
data/017880.wav|a good thing again okay cool chill chill children that was fun that was a good i felt good okay good good good good good good good uh okay cool chill chill chill that was
data/004920.wav|do you have started to leave so they were all imagining a world where
data/014616.wav|recently has been outside of the west or at least outside of like america
data/011193.wav|i would let me tell you
data/027684.wav|at the people that will actually add to the product because it has changed nothing
data/017447.wav|when i was there and i did it freshman year and then i got into the league of
data/031200.wav|and it was really one of my core techniques of speed running by the way the stream title was
data/014155.wav|facing a world some streamers start
data/014755.wav|and everyone loved it so we reached
data/020535.wav|season three okay because in today's modern games climate unless your game is a infinitely generating
data/006393.wav|i have another marker in the remarkable decline of blizzard i don't think this game is
data/015842.wav|maybe but would you watch it there seems unlikely you have to build a brand for it people go to twitch to watch
data/026128.wav|the quarter time ceo he spent three fourths of his time being another ceo for square who owns
data/025815.wav|deep affinity for the league of legends
data/010067.wav|so we are going to launch in
data/026279.wav|if they spend on commercials advertising digital
data/016714.wav|way to reduce commutes and let people live farther away and still get to the
data/007274.wav|full service sweep that he deserves
data/018397.wav|it's like about amazon marketing mondays
data/017892.wav|as what apple has done to great success and
data/011432.wav|so it's a less busy week like a lot of
data/023362.wav|one more fail one more fail
data/022076.wav|try to be funny because generally the first lens we look at when we see a post is who it came from you can see the exact same post from two different people will get different amounts of
data/022147.wav|like this marketing monday and if you do
data/028112.wav|if this is about face clan i want to talk
data/011626.wav|i love movies i'm like i'm kind of like in the
data/004648.wav|as who i was speaking to big fan of marketing monday keep it up from that guy from the as to who i was speaking to big fan of marketing monday keep it up
data/015476.wav|the stuff for free all included they could crush but they don't
data/029025.wav|like i've told it since i was like
data/010433.wav|right lots and lots of chicken
data/006269.wav|invest in what are you talking about
data/024265.wav|the matrix and have all these made i
data/031767.wav|is there will be a viewing party if you guys are able to artificially intelligently generate an entire anime series
data/000983.wav|the answer of course is yes she's practicing right now she loves
data/030871.wav|of league the intelligent genius veteran of league of legends but also not old the one challenge the one monkey wrench thrown into this machine is that i must do it with my trusty sidekick who shows up drunk and late cutie cinderella
data/002083.wav|what is ligma and then you take
data/027360.wav|i think when you think about what is their core identity what if you if you if
data/023452.wav|and this is a dollar okay so i'm making 50 cents right here
data/024257.wav|can already tell where the money came from they literally got lawrence fishburne to
data/002123.wav|who took a massive chunk of the votes by
data/015994.wav|it's a pretty good deal and that's for a lot of uh you know it's
data/001665.wav|what if this is all a ruse and every
data/027508.wav|seven years to go nowhere and ended up lower than that twitter has made no progress while even facebook and snapchat and tick tock continue to bring in massive revenue facebook while you know
data/009514.wav|pretty good he got at least plat right
data/016274.wav|when and give a big win
data/006408.wav|software program with a hundred thousand
data/011459.wav|black thought released a album called cheat codes featuring the late mf doom
data/007954.wav|well you know what i give you is that you like to poggies things that other people
data/016855.wav|i know what to do if you learn about ai you will make money i know that from just
data/008943.wav|i you know what the financing fell through i
data/005291.wav|and that experience i just had told me like probably not that was my first experience in line so when i get to
data/029728.wav|and i feel like within game one he was saying like
data/009303.wav|the state of michigan is running
data/020868.wav|what the people which is okay
data/027510.wav|daily active users the entire time barely growing so overall
data/003333.wav|these are kind of small wins in the grand scheme of things but it is a slight bit of progress because
data/001319.wav|i didn't understand that primitive technology is a real
data/016864.wav|year accelerated rate you can't really see it let me things like
data/003781.wav|it was a pretty good climate change bill
data/027843.wav|yup crypto and i think crypto is one of the biggest
data/025277.wav|as you've said but this is a measure of google search volume for selected series
data/031677.wav|why league like they converted me in that event and
data/019346.wav|i know that i invented the
data/002024.wav|you were enjoying a delicious cup of
data/003396.wav|he was a cheater yeah he's a cheater
data/017744.wav|they have a better purchase experience which makes their brand stronger post purchase they have uh frequent updates

data/027719.wav|i can't even I don't think like

data/017303.wav|indefinitely delayed by copyright lawyers working mostly for disney unfortunately
data/002374.wav|this thing for three months a
data/025557.wav|collar workers all like the office managers they got all of them to work the factory they got like a crash course in training and they're working the factory like
data/031355.wav|wish me for having done any crime in anywhere
data/029135.wav|will deliver the punishment you cannot hide before dig rat what they would do is spam start go to the item menu and click on use helix fossil and then oak would say

data/000453.wav|if the front of me tons of and i'm just like i need a
data/004038.wav|actually i think i just spent like three hours walking around and then fighting
data/032191.wav|and of the phoenix suns and i want to say that was the last smart thing i did that was right about the end of the night on saturday and that was the last intelligent thing that i did that weekend sunday the empire struck back after the cuff if i had walked away on
data/010910.wav|with to go see it we don't necessarily want to play the minions takeover over my face when i'm doing the content we don't want world we don't necessarily want that even because i already have the minions right here one and a minion baby by the way i purchased the with the go see it we don't necessarily want to play the minions takeover over my face when i'm doing the content we don't want
data/002889.wav|ash that you have to pay up is not something
data/000747.wav|but i wouldn't change them one
data/017312.wav|and uh first of all given the fact they
data/010665.wav|and you can't always be pure dj but i played last night with
data/010358.wav|the the toast the tried and true we're going to play four
data/007009.wav|whether or not i'm the coffee cow is irrelevant okay i don't drink it it's empty
data/000692.wav|the mini bar you do before the restaurant so it's even cooler and there's
data/009178.wav|i think i'm way less aware and
data/015793.wav|part of their plans for growing their influence
data/029329.wav|and then like they pointed out the guy
data/013275.wav|it's nice that amazon has tried though currently not quite gotten there with the ability to just react to something with approval like all legal approvals with your chat prime watch parties are a good first step needs a little bit more a little bit more juice in the caboose
data/031091.wav|it's like he's turned that story into a
data/007557.wav|okay fine well then what cd
data/011249.wav|you can say no if you don't want it i guess
data/015122.wav|and they knew this in a way
data/031331.wav|last minute red eye to atlanta to help me in court so my dad flies out and one thing i'll say one
data/009614.wav|then as they try to escape
data/011775.wav|and you that's where you came
data/031805.wav|wow well we finally got out of
data/023997.wav|this is where they were stupid the backlash is immediate and immense
data/006994.wav|i got something i got a gift and i want to shout it out actually
data/019051.wav|it would be my honor for you guys to meet
data/015341.wav|was keep prime churn down and they'll spend almost any amount of money to do it but
data/019862.wav|the be neo the games were huge i mean the the
data/029431.wav|well come on in come on come on in i want
data/020827.wav|what the courage to get on marketing
data/029812.wav|cause i don't think i ever really verbalize this
data/002406.wav|i need a translator i need a csd
data/017160.wav|final run of enron hats will be available for sale
data/029651.wav|was to make a full rap before he goes up
data/026341.wav|yeah people just come in and open the package all day to test the experience and
data/023274.wav|then she knew i cheated she wasn't even like oh
data/032375.wav|and i would get a little nervous and i would choke a little bit and then it would
data/011800.wav|in the hall atrium ship area
data/017616.wav|different direction than other tech companies
data/023351.wav|the fail is our good friends at
data/000814.wav|the wallet is still a little bit in there
data/003860.wav|going to happen and i think one of the biggest problems really of biden is that he just doesn't he doesn't inspire people when he talks
data/017315.wav|ways from walmart in the early 2000s
data/022199.wav|what the for just driving safe like i'm never going
data/028748.wav|and i'm like yo what's up and then
data/001416.wav|let's get blocky milwaukee welcome wacky yo let's get blocky blocky welcome
data/003543.wav|i selling now would mean you're selling at
data/007475.wav|like you can get it you're not
data/000925.wav|the wedding no negotiation over who's next
data/022150.wav|the entire marketing industrial complex can throw at us when people tell me
data/007441.wav|and no one wants to give them up anyway we'll see we'll see what the
data/015913.wav|big shows they want to watch so it's a tough balance you forgot arcane i didn't mention it but obviously it's a great show
data/022669.wav|you might be wondering why all the money was on fire in the
data/013344.wav|well it's a it's a tale that i regret but i wanted to tell you that it happened
data/014976.wav|what has figured out how they're
data/013022.wav|i mean their ideal is like
data/013292.wav|that's not a verbally binding contract just because i happen to read it from the way
data/013654.wav|we literally don't care who are you we don't care we close mixer
data/005579.wav|don't talk to each other so xuc
data/021304.wav|these are the top gaming streams of all
data/007371.wav|did you see that and then we were like
data/014985.wav|and look at all the strategies
data/024060.wav|and again i'm not saying none of them were stupid enough to think that they could go legit but the ones that were launched only fans
data/029013.wav|with you all right i gotta i gotta take a call we're fighting
data/000803.wav|the wallet the fatter the confidence on the gambling
data/005826.wav|it didn't matter at all so anyway
data/007830.wav|the videos for like 12 bucks a pop
data/027090.wav|he dropped this incredibly dire interview
data/002235.wav|would it be only one to ask that
data/008419.wav|so it's like it's never ending circle right
data/017577.wav|where traditional things like advertising has
data/001128.wav|if they're not even hiding it like i wish
data/004985.wav|and so i i can't imagine
data/014948.wav|like might even be a better app for you it
data/002413.wav|i have to make fun of me for you
data/021952.wav|most businesses would say no that's
data/013045.wav|is like by the book everything is like teaching to the test so teachers have no autonomy they can't like make their own lesson plans they can't like be creative with
data/007522.wav|it was truly a once in a lifetime encounter that was
data/017554.wav|one of them being you know this past year massive money printing by the government but in general
data/015541.wav|it has no real adoption none of their shows have reached
data/014426.wav|for writing racist rants it's facebook okay uh once you get a certain amount of
data/008550.wav|is three-fold he's got three different
data/032001.wav|this is a true story i didn't think it was weird until he said yes mrs
data/010655.wav|then after all the notes are done is done like the prep then after all the notes are done and he's done like the prep he brings me
data/007894.wav|the the subs doth thank you for the five gifted let's see your history dofe daft of duffers for the subs doth thank you for the five gifted let's see your history doff
data/020247.wav|samsung why do you pay ryan reynolds to be in your ad why hot canadian sex sells he has the voice of
data/014761.wav|at my wedding there's there's not even there's a real chance that guy plays at my wedding
data/009019.wav|year ago but it was a big
data/032010.wav|it episodes of anime with a rough estimate of
data/023022.wav|oh and then this part was a pretty good argument because look here's the deal apple sony nintendo google samsung they all take
data/020803.wav|if the player will present the award the final award for marketer of the year let me give you one preface before we jump to this
data/007369.wav|cause i can't remember i i haven't seen the actual footage i
data/004763.wav|purchasing her a horse in exchange for an erotic massage on his jet
data/026984.wav|the concept the concept's great by god the
data/012252.wav|in kind of loud but like they knew nobody was there
data/022673.wav|i goofed it so to speak today we're talking about those let's get to the top five baby yahoo buys
data/003225.wav|the growth of the game is dependent entirely
data/029394.wav|and giving everyone their bill and it's individual checks interesting interesting and i realized quickly in my mind with a little bit of calculations i don't have
data/013678.wav|we're going to get my intro and we're going to jump right into
data/002950.wav|biggest movie they've ever done 200
data/024799.wav|do of it you got free primo gems so
data/000436.wav|seven seven eight nine in a
data/012918.wav|which is cool it's like a big number but for
data/015904.wav|we have to spend all this money that's correct
data/000454.wav|start getting everyone on board the blt train and so now german wants a blt stands
data/014351.wav|is up both these companies and it's not about
data/026210.wav|a more in-depth one and this one i really think my audience today are you aware in my chat of an app called klarna who here knows about klarna okay well there's a there's a karma there's a
data/008031.wav|there's so much to do and i
data/007191.wav|and and i can tell i'm saying as i can
data/004922.wav|in the firings so the company has
data/030997.wav|in that era is the peak of rents in sf and landlords that
data/003715.wav|you'd think nothing can be done but in fact
data/023694.wav|have you met the internet do you think that
data/019029.wav|i dove in on the concept of
data/023766.wav|sketch where he's the one that doesn't know what's going on he's like trying to be normal
data/028360.wav|if you work office jobs there's some
data/020282.wav|if the same amount of brand recognition for free i'm sorry not actor
data/022204.wav|as we all get extra emotional
data/014743.wav|food from ari maybe we delay this five minutes so i can eat
data/006948.wav|now i have to like now i gotta take charge of my life
data/032319.wav|the reason he took longer to go live was because he's
data/023247.wav|in the pack it was a complete scam and that's why i
data/016371.wav|accountability committee when the small business administration in sending that money out basically said to people apply and sign and tell us that you're really
data/014570.wav|it oh my god well they had it for a little bit they had a rewind but they added recently
data/004260.wav|spend the v bucks instead of the
data/031119.wav|and it took eight i took me eight hours but anyway i i
data/010368.wav|the main thing is the reddit we're gonna do a bunch of reddit stuff and then
data/002173.wav|i cyber looked up every single person at twitch that was
data/005061.wav|in a bit of a clown and at the
data/026125.wav|and marketing starting with a major win for exactly five minutes to twitter shareholders because ceo of twitter jack dorsey finally stepped down to take a role as gandalf in lord of the
data/028345.wav|and just gets raw forward smashed he was
data/027069.wav|the more clever than this and this wasn't i
data/025541.wav|your workers went on strike um
data/024865.wav|convenience being able to cut down on the grind being able to get something quicker than everyone else that is where you can get absolutely massive amounts of money and in fact for example
data/017962.wav|no that's not a good way to
data/028861.wav|no i didn't do any of that no what i
data/028440.wav|the base is not far from school actually the school was
data/030024.wav|came together and you know what
data/026061.wav|and struggling a group that's been
data/029307.wav|of universal studios and this is like early riot this is like
data/028735.wav|how it's actually was two tickets it was two tickets it was two tickets
data/008606.wav|will defeat the spam bots or die trying and then his bid succeeds
data/003327.wav|we're still not outpacing inflation which is a little bit higher than that but you are a closer to maintaining
data/013838.wav|leave that they control spider-man outside of film rights do you think sony has this weird belief
data/000955.wav|it's smarter earlier in the week usually if you're like me you start out each week kind of intelligent and then as the week goes on all your brain cells die it's kind of like the birth life cycle of a cicada or something you know it's like
data/004418.wav|things about it anyway the guy that owns scrub
data/003151.wav|and it just feels like meta is
data/024608.wav|fashion is what won this week because it
data/031212.wav|from my criminal record it takes place in atlanta not far from the headquarters of the
data/008319.wav|so times are good got a nice little recession going got the supreme court stripping people of their rights
data/015338.wav|that's the main strategy they have is
data/017281.wav|it's the day where classic works entered
data/028526.wav|yeah a lot of stuff to do
data/004906.wav|your accounts and so in response they started to fight
data/002744.wav|well i win by giving away 150
data/022091.wav|just quickly make sure we add the logo to that image we don't want people ripping that off from us i guess my one piece of advice to social media
data/011057.wav|when i was growing up because i moved every two three years i never had like
data/030333.wav|one thing facebook's good for other than radicalizing the elderly it's
data/028187.wav|that let me try and explain it
data/021291.wav|i now you're like wow what did he just
data/015334.wav|is good invincible's good but they haven't
data/023219.wav|but apparently it makes consumers think it's safer they'll just put like that's like saying exists you're increasing the
data/017193.wav|a little scared i was a little
data/029092.wav|very close to happening like baby rage i i knew this baby this was the head of twitch asia had a baby i met the baby when we were
data/026941.wav|we'll frustrations rocket mortgage positions them as real problems offers them as the the
data/002146.wav|welcome hello it's not always so hostile it's not always so hostile it's the hitman
data/020724.wav|campaign not only did they double their following count on social in one month which is literally unheard of but they increase traffic to their purchase
data/018292.wav|i wanted to be that guy
data/017040.wav|so we're on the same page yeah that that tracks
data/013970.wav|the credit card company will fight for you they have an incentive to keep you happy and using their service so they will accept the chargeback karna and these companies will do no
data/020267.wav|during couldn't get the chance let's start with a pepsi commercial because i always hate pepsi commercials santa my man making a pepsi but mr
data/030211.wav|if the one we were running up and he was just holding
data/018432.wav|because it has the best tech the reason
data/024750.wav|that marketers and game designers use to
data/010398.wav|the fair and reliable good internet
data/007752.wav|but then i'm not particularly fast right i'm just
data/012914.wav|we're going to sell real products like like if the marketing goes well like more
data/012087.wav|as group lunches and dinners and there's a group like meetings with the
data/027901.wav|we're back it's been like three weeks
data/023436.wav|i can't i can't tell you to do what i didn't do i stayed up
data/019590.wav|it was i guess they had the free credit
data/024695.wav|i have a feeling that the dip that we are
data/016374.wav|at for blank it's all automated
data/000108.wav|i didn't know if it made sense because you know we are friends we found out in person
data/012677.wav|isn't that the worst thing wow could do
data/028318.wav|games and he starts playing smash 4. and he's
data/006633.wav|with stands right and lud actually
data/012713.wav|i mean if they do it right it'll be really cool
data/029214.wav|for your 10 gifted thank you for the
data/008228.wav|i was not run like he steps down and if he could do that and we could present an alternate viable candidate
data/000526.wav|and we open the wide doors and we're walking in and we hear the
data/000858.wav|that's just being born as a baby and growing to an old man there's
data/011394.wav|there is a five thousand dollar star
data/003356.wav|you know type uh crash so
data/007310.wav|and i felt no no no one of them was
data/012871.wav|i signed up and i didn't show up did you
data/015651.wav|and so all i could get was this which is a couple of loose
data/013184.wav|in arizona so when you say i am too i know that you're lying we all make
data/010789.wav|what kind of a morbius where you invent a new thing and you
data/012659.wav|i think for tonight well what
data/013950.wav|it's a big problem and so i just want to make sure that this branding does not fool you
data/029726.wav|ain't like dude this is going to be hard for
data/004213.wav|gas before we get to that
data/027618.wav|in the question he says basically about this tweet talking about how tesla has a second bigot market in china chinese
data/014673.wav|no wins and fails i'm gonna
data/005967.wav|he's got like 40 tweets on it
data/025876.wav|went off over and over and over and over when you mess up they will flip on
data/030669.wav|what's got to get a question right we have to go home i pull up the sign lake
data/027256.wav|whether or not they're right that being
data/006472.wav|strip clubs are suddenly very empty there's no better indicator that inflation is up incomes are down savings are down
data/009877.wav|what is a long process well i mean right now it's probably i guess if you have if
data/021065.wav|it'll be worth it if even one person says the name k-mart i'm actually crying
data/018259.wav|so in general it's a good way to farm i i never count
data/029003.wav|i would beat your ass dude
data/012066.wav|i was into it he had the most banter he remembered
data/006919.wav|with the blends anonymous balloons anonymous
data/002272.wav|get your own cat name of ford if tupac actually fake his own death that'll be great marketing for his next get your own cat name of ford if tupac actually faked his own death that would be great marketing for his
data/010917.wav|i'm gonna play fall guys or i'm
data/026730.wav|as of steam they have to beg to get you on the platform but once they're so big that everyone uses it then you have to
data/010979.wav|is not even going to the cinema but renting us
data/027822.wav|people during this fall are spending more than they ever have on buying stocks this is already risky this is a
data/031241.wav|did not have free wi-fi the hotel did
data/012663.wav|did he told me to play it
data/012212.wav|i go to the finals the the top four the
data/019914.wav|it's why i included it this ad is why
data/007129.wav|all throughout the flight including this old
data/012753.wav|in korea china he had more
data/022668.wav|late april fools for that year
data/005433.wav|as i've learned every single thing must be scripted ahead of time
data/012883.wav|it's just it's it's predatory how the prices have increased so much over the past
data/005240.wav|like all right well i guess we just wait in
data/029177.wav|to the game i i'll say it i was against
data/013282.wav|if i asked we wouldn't know for five
data/023069.wav|in the thousand dollars and this is the average american that includes every american rich or poor and when you spend a lot of money on food that creates a lot of people that want that money
data/021477.wav|it's just everyone betting that the meme will get bigger and they can sell which is a ponzi scheme
data/029572.wav|and then you know armada and i remember in genesis 1 when
data/018311.wav|pretty cool thanks man i'm not sure you get marketing monday just yet
data/016588.wav|i have this startup worth 1.3 billion
data/025691.wav|i the have any specific meaning and it's open to interpretation
data/023215.wav|there is no defined time for how long that chicken needs to have been on free
data/025304.wav|i could go too much without watching
data/017668.wav|here's a great example that they have this is an internal leaked apple video okay
data/022589.wav|would drown it would be like it would
data/025385.wav|so again i was gonna originally make fun of this and call it a fail and then i was like is that just
data/005914.wav|i don't even no i didn't i didn't
data/007380.wav|and so he didn't make it i was worried
data/002351.wav|i'm in a double relationship because i
data/015924.wav|so that's one thing i didn't mention that i probably should have is that one other advantage netflix has is they have a
data/008928.wav|did they even put in his chuck norris tweet chuck mate and they said for musk it would seem
data/004310.wav|how's everything going hey good to see
data/017279.wav|ryan reynolds turn it immediately into an ad called winnie the screwed by mint mobile
data/010059.wav|but it was making fun of videos like that
data/018248.wav|is that have ever seen check my mentions on twitter okay why
data/020321.wav|the amazing role as background party actor three it was chef's kiss trust me
data/018093.wav|i was distracted by the woman in
data/017918.wav|stuck into watching a hundred more they all
data/012736.wav|i think people like i think about the reward
data/028337.wav|and the kid is right there also now more than
data/023098.wav|the other companies that have uh done some little tricky
data/002770.wav|with them today but they're interesting so we can jump into them in just a second i'm
data/001079.wav|and like in the first sentence i'm like oh that's crazy and then i don't i can't now i have to double dip now i have no that's crazy left and he's
data/017808.wav|all the different stuff that people interact with the brand across the thing and you can learn about how to make how
data/003934.wav|and he's also a loon in
data/026266.wav|and the most valuable brand in the world so how did they get their brand to be worth so much more than everyone else's including other big tech companies that have
data/027470.wav|each year due to global warming and why climate crisis reform has been completely
data/012962.wav|at school and come back that's fine
data/014749.wav|bow your head in reverence to one of the greatest songs ever made uh the
data/012702.wav|in the worse does law or the
data/030814.wav|i can do this anyway that that oh sea otters paul champ
data/026660.wav|with uh with this man this guy is like a
data/022738.wav|in spend a lot of money on phones too
data/013898.wav|we will be good i'm not gonna
data/023180.wav|and it's because that's literally glue like not even a joke like most pictures of cereal you see
data/000637.wav|if the some new clothes too because we
data/008107.wav|yeah i should give subs to ee as
data/017356.wav|we're thinking so long term the company is already working with preschools to establish the foundation of tech education so that as our hiring demand
data/023907.wav|there's no ad you could do
data/028831.wav|wait melee all night i played
data/026669.wav|okay before the first season of overwatch league launched he came to twitch bobby kodek and the blizzard team
data/012113.wav|tower one tower five and i'm like
data/028176.wav|pretty that is losing money hand over fist
data/022501.wav|would have made it but it wasn't that
data/012946.wav|know that went to work there got laid off and they started a total meltdown over the next
data/021355.wav|book every sleazy underhanded trick in the book so let me show you why i need to explain what's going on because this is how most of you sound
data/022615.wav|wait i forgot what that says in chinese
data/004082.wav|wednesday by the way does anyone else say wednesday
data/006137.wav|what did you link me with your sub
data/028342.wav|now he's like focused now he's focused and
data/027458.wav|but i can tell you one thing i'll tell you
data/004659.wav|at the chill at home and stream so it should
data/000853.wav|didn't grow up right like if you're trying to be wise about it he's got a childlike wonder he's a child that didn't grow up but you said he's a child that grew up which is what everybody does
data/017829.wav|i bought an expensive graphics card is massive it is a massive way to grow brand value in
data/003484.wav|no i don't hey ping ping
data/017869.wav|we're just like nike is very good at pre-purchase
data/016918.wav|with the prime look at denis thank
data/010373.wav|in the tank have you seen the newest
data/013909.wav|the two different ipod shuffles and then i have to plug my headphones into those and so
data/021407.wav|you don't have it and so if it starts to go up you need to quickly cover that bet because it can go up forever and you could lose a bazillion dollars
data/029942.wav|i remember very distinctly i couldn't go to that event i was sitting in my my then girlfriend's apartment watching royal flush and when
data/020286.wav|for yourself is six months ahead of of tier one disneyland snowman commercial let's check this

data/010111.wav|there's a video and a conspiracy on the chow kindergartens from sonic adventure 2. i'll watch that sounds interesting

data/018588.wav|the xbox knows this is like their do or die moment and they're spending dummy money
data/024692.wav|doc let's say you're like really excited to get into amazon stock or whatever
data/021115.wav|die on this hill okay if you guys want me
data/005013.wav|about twitter it must be hard to do due diligence when you have to father so
data/019917.wav|in a magazine that said john
data/020723.wav|monday good question here's the answer yes in fact when i looked into the results of the
data/031621.wav|team liquid and he was on team liquid so it was like the biggest party i remember him showing up to a club with glasses on at night like it's a
data/013794.wav|science has figured out who it was actual
data/030403.wav|would hear me that well but he sees my intensity which makes him all the more curious as to what's in my bag so he's like
data/005933.wav|the first thing is this is one of the most interesting moments to happen in melee
data/024752.wav|the beautiful gorgeous world we see here of
data/006307.wav|cringe reviewer quantum mass flagged act man for exposing quantum shitty behavior is quantum that guy from the elden ring bad takes video
data/015971.wav|is lost money every year of
data/031744.wav|waiting on the mouse okay gliss lord master
data/010644.wav|that i've been lucky to partner with
data/030684.wav|you barely you didn't have as much time to to think about it you know
data/006642.wav|boss makes a dollar i make a dime that's why i watch a truck on company time
data/011156.wav|nothing oh i thought you're going to say my
data/004603.wav|if you guys enjoy i hope
data/006804.wav|he needed that he needed that dude
data/011766.wav|we're still putting our bags away for christ's sake we're not even space
data/007256.wav|it's a joke it's a joke and it's funny and and
data/026327.wav|we're talking about spending your money when i
data/023415.wav|and i feel too good about it so if you
data/017147.wav|thing where i get to blow up a car
data/012461.wav|but here's the problem so the the storms
data/000129.wav|there was a little bit of weed
data/029875.wav|it's not much in love you were with me
data/002700.wav|now yours maybe you want to go play it maybe
data/010264.wav|not a twitch streamer stan's not available because he has a
data/032384.wav|just just take a look take a look at if i use descending dark once
data/018593.wav|it there's two options no yeah
data/008433.wav|tom scott did that yeah but he's british so
data/025054.wav|if i had to guess they say facebook is also huge hashtag delete facebook was trending and people try to get
data/023465.wav|seven or eight thousand cars that's it in the whole year and you'd think wow one
data/029386.wav|cause i didn't know who he was i honestly didn't know i was a esports addict and let me tell you when i asked that that was worse than apparently
data/006249.wav|it feels so much sweeter when other people don't have it you know
data/009591.wav|and they get all the way to the base and they
data/003192.wav|but it's a big l from where i'm standing uh
data/027556.wav|the poison pill is a rule emergency backup plan that
data/003273.wav|it was plenty of positive stories out there
data/002870.wav|pretty big blow to his ability to really stretch it out even though he has a ton of money
data/027622.wav|right person to say this because amazon has bowed to the same pressures specifically they partnered with
data/026057.wav|fix the error as soon as the company became
data/029303.wav|in this industry i know some people let me
data/023590.wav|it's twitter account called brands getting owned and we're
data/015140.wav|if you make a good enough show or a good
data/016990.wav|we're hollywood needs china for money and china you know chinese consumers want hollywood movies chinese government
data/009856.wav|yeah colleges are like that i mean college towns are often like that because people don't have cars
data/016669.wav|never before this is exponentially decreasing in
data/000145.wav|incredibly weird and if they do sell it's worths do you realize there's no
data/030951.wav|it is i can show you a wonderful
data/012786.wav|in have never thought of he's like yeah i can't out practice the koreans but i can make a strategy they won't be
data/020241.wav|oh no please ignore that ignore that
data/006048.wav|he said bro i can't wait to pump
data/013547.wav|it's like link is told me that had all the chats
data/005541.wav|but i'm sure it'll be amazing and i know how it like
data/024847.wav|the biggest thing i ever spent money on was hearthstone cards because i wanted to
data/018847.wav|well as emotionally mature as I'm sure all
data/013985.wav|i pay later companies please be careful of them
data/020777.wav|not be sprite cranberry though because that was not came out this year obviously stop asking stop
data/014515.wav|into a rough idea of red version if you wouldn't mind looking at it if it's not too late into a rough idea of red version if you wouldn't mind looking at it if it's not too late to make my skyfall thank you man i appreciate that
data/013584.wav|jokes about ludwig's dad jeez dude
data/011781.wav|for a hallway and they give us like a little bit of a safety video
data/011926.wav|i'm going to give you i'm going
data/003791.wav|it's getting too late i can't
data/013702.wav|celebrities have a real power on twitter
data/018591.wav|i do i mean on pc it'll be on pc and
data/032307.wav|it's not harder but it can be
data/030020.wav|started this game out muted i'm not gonna lie i'll keep it a
data/023731.wav|and most importantly to me i use it at night when i'm listening to podcasts before i go to bed in bed it's a game changer okay that combined with reason number two the long battery life
data/018474.wav|but i'd give the edge to sony
data/031445.wav|we're looking out there we both like start walking towards him because
data/007725.wav|thanks big a also i'm a girl so you
data/025818.wav|is what i was talking about a hundred percent on
data/009150.wav|rick and morty is that it
data/012852.wav|we on something like that um
data/021865.wav|i only know how to play this champion
data/031597.wav|where i was going to write about
data/028240.wav|and i was like damn this resume looks good
data/029017.wav|i beat either of us bro you squat
data/025986.wav|was hilarious it's about and eating it
data/003067.wav|why we're all fine and nobody
data/012047.wav|i don't have a video of it but like the wall instead of like the laser beam
data/015501.wav|i think unlikely i think netflix is purely focused on content but
data/022051.wav|well because again mostly with social it's an act to try and not
data/027251.wav|it was an ubisoft game you would have paid
data/009861.wav|some partial truth to that for sure
data/001506.wav|well for me than what i was doing before which
data/019837.wav|it sounds like a bunch of weird um
data/017717.wav|if the form factor that's an advertisement
data/022058.wav|i think the arab spring riots rumor is they heard our new spring collection is now available online
data/010027.wav|what i just the problem is that goddamn confetti on youtube has got me hooked
data/022839.wav|the biggest loser of all time because i lost about eight billion dollars personally
data/027007.wav|what are these will be forgotten this one probably won't
data/012932.wav|actually very powerful and very but i didn't
data/004629.wav|and buys the yacht you know what i'm saying this
data/028224.wav|it's great i didn't see what he did at apex but i trust him i think
data/013826.wav|what to show you one way let's look at the comments on this
data/008359.wav|in the earth and killed everyone else watering is lucky
data/020294.wav|if i'm looking at it i think this is like the
data/005209.wav|way they said he was like oh great
data/000626.wav|it was such a nice time that it made me rethink my life and i'm like maybe i'm working too much
data/019418.wav|what makes a good jingle and to do that we have a special guest who i personally invited this guy hey walt in your opinion what makes
data/027800.wav|if the everything bubble pops which is already doing we need to get scapegoat there's no scapegoat good enough and in history
data/029413.wav|that the waiter would come back and be
data/016695.wav|it over the next 20 years and they're
data/027082.wav|i i want to talk about sort of the the situation we find ourselves in in
data/003507.wav|but i do think we're probably entering in a rocky environment for things like
data/018596.wav|they're not going to work hard on this but assuming it comes out here's the deal they're the options are
data/029931.wav|i remember i was talking to mango after
data/007349.wav|to me being a game of thrones nurse that nerd
data/011093.wav|really care what you ask everyone's doing and
data/015684.wav|i think these two are so small and insignificant on their own
data/024457.wav|at the time so they're like doubling down and spending a ton of money on a huge new ad campaign to try and
data/025578.wav|i don't want to just roast mark zuckerberg here i also want to roast deb a little bit
data/027666.wav|i tomatoes and then you take the seeds
data/012357.wav|like an escape pod which is just the back of
data/024701.wav|none of these ever actually were produced and guess what they raised billions this company just the car company was worth more than ford despite
data/020710.wav|no i want to see how our first
data/007221.wav|incredibly low for where he got
data/021989.wav|on the internet for good just yet that's the end your next stop now though assuming you have uh less morals than me
data/025738.wav|knives out i'm like that was a pretty good commercial because it
data/029142.wav|my parents wouldn't buy it for me they would not buy me pokemon red they would buy me pokemon cards i was showing off my new shiny hollow foil nitto king and this kid was like hey i'll trade you pokemon red the game for that nitto king and i was
data/008747.wav|and again these type of tender offers
data/005788.wav|and i get roasted i get roasted for checking to see if my
data/000275.wav|the big poker streamer event and he had gambled a bunch like
data/006541.wav|let's have a technology company and more
data/024181.wav|because i can ride or die
data/008159.wav|in just a second boys watch party if it's tonight it'll be late maybe it'll be tomorrow the problem is i have i'm
data/012368.wav|so like you'd be like hey we need to you know ari
data/003990.wav|good one to end on appreciate that you know you're going to turn 30 as well and
data/019667.wav|did you ever show anybody at your work once it was done
data/008825.wav|it's crazy how like i feel like
data/010754.wav|or something you're looking at my and you probably have your phone open
data/002546.wav|asap rocky or we will move on to the next one he wants
data/000354.wav|it's like it's like two back-to-back things and you can put five people on each side and we have enough to fill up the whole
data/025167.wav|and moved very fast they bought him a truck
data/014527.wav|the competition breeds excellence and that's exactly what's happening
data/023017.wav|apple and google both removed fortnite from their stores because they wanted
data/020465.wav|implications than just one game being a
data/020504.wav|in value it's not just the value of the money
data/006864.wav|at the beginning like ordering and i was like what should i get us you know it's like people were like good chicken the whole
data/006591.wav|in nationwide tour at theaters please pull him out make
data/030239.wav|i got shampoo as a gift and that's all
data/014654.wav|is not a real concept uh sleepy
data/031881.wav|this is actually what's gonna happen
data/004184.wav|it's to get back to me and then they're like okay so how about two o'clock on a tuesday
data/024551.wav|whoa to web and and do this easier so for example if you're in spotify and you want to pay for spotify premium if you do it through ios apple gets a cut but
data/021577.wav|i'll deliver to you in a
data/015375.wav|the i understand how to make a good product they understand
data/004570.wav|i'll talk about it but i mean we've
data/003851.wav|and they both like different parts of his personality and
data/025692.wav|like he's some kind of artiste you're
data/019644.wav|i don't know if you saw it on there was the mcdonald's shingle
data/012958.wav|it's just my opinion though again
data/008425.wav|far more important for your future it is for sure for sure no one's
data/023488.wav|their strategy is one of the original the easiest most basic but core marketing strategies and the idea of more for less the idea is literally to show you how much you're getting at an affordable price that is entirely different from
data/020606.wav|to get king delroy live for this event can i get some
data/012638.wav|the on me and your bad attitude towards all things that's not that's not my fault
data/018880.wav|if the target market his children would be
data/000538.wav|and we go in to the thing and there's three watches and lovely guys the fourth
data/015859.wav|it's uh it's interesting future and so
data/032270.wav|one of the most degenerate things i've ever heard he is literally teleconferencing we can't we can't take video you can't have your
data/010139.wav|it's not a coffee cat it's not
data/012105.wav|you guys get the coolant system like he
data/006015.wav|really surprised and impressed because yeah
data/001624.wav|title this video i have a video of my first day playing the new hitman map where i set the world record a couple
data/023555.wav|and then they just use their dominant market share to win other things so for example
data/000635.wav|we gotta make some money and so we all
data/007114.wav|why the vaccine isn't real and i was like
data/010329.wav|organized competitive streamer event when i think of that i think a slime
data/005468.wav|thankfully i didn't get too many
data/001254.wav|skill set and people would pay a lot for
data/000654.wav|the casino probably made their suites worth
data/004686.wav|it's decision almost like i set up this
data/009128.wav|they ride him so hard he's
data/023060.wav|get ninja skin you know do your part little do you know
data/010205.wav|in front of me i didn't want it
data/022818.wav|the a company so people think it wasn't going
data/024646.wav|was actually living in but on the books it was worth a lot of money a company like evergrand which is a real estate
data/028613.wav|the story behind a shirt yes
data/013178.wav|did you see the adidas suite yeah but i
data/013649.wav|complaining i have an important important
data/025956.wav|in the lower and there is no near-term
data/014637.wav|what's up what's up what's up what's good what's
data/023941.wav|think through and through but what's clever about it is that you know he built this whole campaign
data/013876.wav|one of their games including legends of roon
data/000678.wav|we take a break we go to dinner uh
data/016302.wav|in today's presentation the full marketing
data/026323.wav|the extremely beautiful touch points for the first time you get to interact and touch a new apple
data/026960.wav|are you ready the meta quest
data/030843.wav|ben so i just want to make sure i i i have your question correct i want to make sure i understand completely what you're asking me so you're saying do you think my
data/003083.wav|and no longer feels as funny it's not it's
data/015906.wav|whoever wins prizes are going up i
data/024895.wav|them one and system two system one is our
data/028725.wav|whites about league get a vip area for stable
data/001385.wav|wait guess it could be i'm gonna guess abraham
data/018019.wav|to rando guy i forget his name he was really
data/019011.wav|that's my gamers that's the gamers i know why would a brand want to do this what what's the benefit because your first reaction a lot of you is creepy this is creepy right that's the why not they're cheaper significantly significantly cheaper now let's say you wanted to
data/017873.wav|more their focus is that other brand stuff
data/013971.wav|no such thing so you're you're not really getting anything they're literally have no
data/006841.wav|but it was uh it was
data/016550.wav|it used to cost a hundred million
data/019178.wav|if there is a massive crash in the industry all of these consoles were churning out
data/011891.wav|but it's still other people now here's what i'll say half the people
data/004766.wav|a lot of things that he was doing before
data/032086.wav|we talking about i thought my fox did great
data/000753.wav|more with those guys um but it was a good
data/011373.wav|or a sincere hello you guys
data/017857.wav|companies in general are so bad at this part of it and the ones you've seen that have thrived are really good at it
data/009506.wav|god but maybe it's just me but if a guy is named yasuo
data/016659.wav|age and it wasn't growing nearly as fast so
data/011363.wav|in a break will no longer be tolerated
data/011706.wav|that's where it is and she's like no no no no no that's for staff and she thought she thought we were so stupid thankfully
data/025908.wav|ready to begin with get back to basics when uh
data/011693.wav|want to be that guy that that's not that there's no benefit to doing
data/022701.wav|it's because they had to hit a hundred
data/028915.wav|the key to the story is that he told me he could not get a taxi
data/010831.wav|and then on monday i'll be playing smite with clint mango seer and connery's pants
data/007576.wav|this mammoth plate of food features three eggs a half pound of meat and then more than enough spinach uh you have to play jump king
data/011066.wav|cause he's not posted let me ask
data/017769.wav|or audience and that can work but i think
data/023453.wav|i'll make a box for you this is my
data/014498.wav|i'm not i'm not taking you out in the alley and
data/030354.wav|with somebody and i don't hate them and i actually like
data/008404.wav|so it's you know it's it's just interesting and i i want to show you a couple
data/026870.wav|while comparing them to this will show you how how far they can fall next we got avocados from mexico this is
data/031026.wav|i often wonder if he was aware and that conversation scared him away from
data/031945.wav|the bus driver had like kidnapped a bunch of kids and all the kids were like writing messages in the windows you
data/018638.wav|because amazon and and uh and google
data/014963.wav|easy way to keep track of it is with lily bank i can just swipe
data/026439.wav|from mango you get an immediate visual and audio queue reward you get your sub
data/009978.wav|as a couple of nice guys getting their jackets after you after you after you after you after you after you've seen that scene i mean
data/008396.wav|i legal document in front of a
data/012122.wav|the all those screens that everyone sees out show the ship stopping and like the captain's freaking out like what's going on it's kind of like majora's mask where no matter where you
data/019082.wav|wash it a step further than we
data/016012.wav|it'll give you the money that's basically the deal that's basically the deal and so if you are saying let's take on
data/031066.wav|which had been acquired by amazon and i just
data/008869.wav|the shareholders of twitter will probably sue the board for not pushing
data/029293.wav|the games warner brothers games the guy who ran the department i had reached out to him and i had just
data/025892.wav|he was playing like his freedom
data/013771.wav|i yeah i was i was i was uh
data/023445.wav|that is line one the red line cost line
data/007782.wav|well today that would be cool that would be cool i
data/019953.wav|it's my number ten i think
data/019498.wav|a good point to make here is that
data/019807.wav|at the school it was just a week week game it did not seem polished like a million dollars
data/014530.wav|i said something that's really wise one of the wisest things he's ever
data/025293.wav|it's the same win it's netflix
data/012884.wav|like they just they raise the prices every year without raising the quality of the education or the or the the
data/027779.wav|at the do we're going to talk about everything i'm
data/002750.wav|let's roll and see what we would have gotten this is
data/023787.wav|well as marketing expert this guy won the canadian can lion 10 years running
data/023736.wav|lot of huge markups in the branded
data/004559.wav|welcome to marketing monday on a monday for once
data/001821.wav|do saudi arabian city well i've known about
data/004764.wav|you know he he started talking
data/017697.wav|of service afterwards greatly increased their chances of
data/013355.wav|you go that chug chug go
data/008210.wav|if you don't think it's cringe then i i
data/011873.wav|is that it's not about a relaxing two-day
data/002943.wav|and then there was like one scene where
data/028046.wav|it was the first one to make any progress against the monolith that is amazon and amazon immediately fired back amazon went and fired every single senior manager who worked at that warehouse for losing the battle to the
data/016449.wav|no more that benefits us as prices rise simply we'll have less money to spend it
data/019085.wav|but as you get closer looking real people get more creeped out that's the uncanny valley the line for
data/031813.wav|it's to me it's me and lincus
data/000489.wav|it'll be worth it it'll be worth it it'll be worth it it'll be worth it it'll be worth it
data/013930.wav|the biggest fears that is more than the number of people in that age group that are afraid of war or death they are more afraid of credit card debt than dying as a generation okay and so but they still want to buy things they would still like to buy things and so buy now pay later has been an attractive
data/022222.wav|alcohol brand alcohol praise on depression you know what's funny is like if it's just two brothers sharing a drink like up to here it's still a good
data/013383.wav|environmental impact aside it's dope you can take a whole row you can lay down
data/016500.wav|i did on the biggest trend of his lifetime to go the internet and
data/018720.wav|what do you have on their side they have the flex factor better games higher install base currently problem here is that microsoft
data/011770.wav|and like four different people and i noticed
data/021418.wav|i love billionaires were making tons of money off
data/031164.wav|if the front about you know all the stuff that
data/013440.wav|not because of star wars which she was
data/015955.wav|you have a great future at
data/020409.wav|i think if this guy was like like just like totally slacking doesn't care and the elf would be super cute like the
data/018017.wav|the first thing i flip open
data/003165.wav|to be a little while before we're really
data/015574.wav|started going back to normalcy or this
data/022925.wav|basically what that means is we're not making money off this if we go
data/027860.wav|i mean there's only one coin that i'm buying the dip
data/029995.wav|it's such a weird because you grew in this niche of like
data/026123.wav|it's time to actually get into the marketing monday is that true my
data/031797.wav|out of nowhere i'm talking about like
data/021587.wav|it was and so they're freaking out as i would be if i owed somebody all these carrots why don't you believe in diamond hands because of human psychology and because
data/018003.wav|it's others you know that's the
data/018428.wav|it's like buy netflix and you have to
data/027258.wav|they are choosing to avoid making the money because the brand gain is probably worth it for them in the long run over the
data/003409.wav|and tensions between the united states and china over taiwan are heating up dramatically in fact nancy pelosi who has a planned trip to taiwan is basically right now in a
data/011762.wav|i could come on you know where california
data/026583.wav|the first of all tone makes it come
data/002949.wav|it was nobody talks in that movie
data/005340.wav|as everyone was super duper duper uber nice
data/028580.wav|oh that's the exact amount you just made
data/004598.wav|just i'll take less pay if they just give me a longer run
data/010616.wav|at the lyric collab everyone's been asking for
data/024018.wav|go crazy and so only fans
data/017572.wav|we're has with a brand into three major sections on the clock
data/001862.wav|super excited and he's like i can't wait to make it happen and
data/030216.wav|no party he got to the last up is where i peed myself you went down before me i screwed up as
data/014295.wav|no one else is coming up the war is essentially won by twitch
data/019177.wav|advertising where you basically say your competitor's name has fallen out of
data/011438.wav|as the joker laugh i used a regular ring but i went
data/024254.wav|let me tell you why you're here it is the world of luxury that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth we just want to get our
data/005859.wav|i think as long as he doesn't do anything like that again he i think he can rebuild what he's got which is
data/023667.wav|day we're supposed to arrive and then
data/007226.wav|i forgot one part flashback the previous
data/022636.wav|i got a question how are the
data/005392.wav|the front pretend we didn't say that if i think speaking that out loud is like speaking of devil's curse
data/017905.wav|conspicuously consume them so if you're an apple watch user everyone knows it it's a walking advertisement for the brand
data/004147.wav|i told them that it's like hey i didn't know you
data/026878.wav|the concept of the ad is a coliseum tailgate
data/025401.wav|i think it's a win but your call
data/030700.wav|i just got rolled by a fourth grader
data/032102.wav|this story happened in real life i was there it was a pretty boring night we got high and watched anime
data/010997.wav|what a attempt to do the balloons boss write
data/019908.wav|let me give you the back story
data/025292.wav|at right into my second win
data/030436.wav|we recently and that was only like a day after so i literally
data/018762.wav|doesn't really matter the cool thing about flex factor in marketing is that it doesn't matter if it's ugly or beautiful as long as you can tell that it's expensive again i'm getting a very strong iphone versus android vibe here
data/011742.wav|so i'm talking to jenny and mark and
data/009721.wav|i they don't even say that just thinking about that is horrendous ah ah
data/018670.wav|microsoft did was they came out with a very attractive price point for the
data/023568.wav|to where you think that's worth something they are making racks
data/019746.wav|i have eminem like really accurately sounds super like him and it can stay on a beat
data/025898.wav|support this type of workplace culture we're
data/005781.wav|product my youtube analytics i just opened up my youtube analytics
data/001743.wav|where the deck and then i'll fall overboard and they'll call for help and then we'll turn around so he walks up to a stranger
data/013811.wav|it's been locked in they were very coy about it they were very very coy when the first they were like hey we don't know
data/005540.wav|where i got like hey congratulations congrats congrats on the wedding i know that i couldn't get a seat but
data/008463.wav|it's a big guy your favorite sub is back for
data/028261.wav|the openly illegal but like the most lying manipulative psychopathic um just like gaslighting
data/013695.wav|so i don't know i thought
data/004548.wav|and he said yes which is crazy and then he's here right now off camera in the grew suit and i'm
data/009471.wav|and if we put him on
data/015376.wav|well they're just very good at talent
data/029625.wav|i think the way it started was it was going to
data/011741.wav|i i think the only thing they knew
data/015803.wav|watching a lot of amazon prime stuff in general they have they
data/028082.wav|phone but it would have built in itunes functionality and if you ever
data/013894.wav|there's nothing to get about i'm
data/009605.wav|yasuo all in the mid lane
data/016037.wav|but it's very hard to keep track of all the subscriptions you have for example for
data/016847.wav|and the one that i'm least comfortable
data/022833.wav|because if you want to know what he thinks about this they actually
data/004034.wav|i was sick after i beat eldon ring i played a
data/008726.wav|well the money that twitter has made so far from their normal business dealings has been made fraudulently every
data/002669.wav|and that is a number between one and six a number between one and six is all i
data/012649.wav|at one second long better call
data/025893.wav|in the court and the idea of beating the case on the
data/009328.wav|if the phone even kids have phone everyone's
data/016071.wav|what is bringing forward the latest medium
data/022779.wav|this housing bubble's kind of bursting
data/014887.wav|that a really great launch of halo infinite they had a really great launch of halo
data/015078.wav|is going they think let's get rid of this dvd rental business and they spun it off as a company called
data/026694.wav|do another hondo millie and somehow this man despite consistently lower viewership every year manages to get another big deal with youtube this is again i
data/029338.wav|it's fine you know i have pleasant small talk with him i'm not like super anxious
data/005189.wav|so anyway i have a lot a lot a lot a lot
data/011909.wav|in this but you know whatever
data/009764.wav|it's not basically just the parent trap in no way is what i described similar to the plot of the lindsay lohan vehicle the parent trap at no point does she remove her face surgically right right you guys get that though right you
data/030744.wav|true or false true or false a truck will
data/031106.wav|because the time is coming you know he i
data/000378.wav|well that i'm down because after that we go back to the casino
data/019204.wav|i handle and it was purple like the Barney
data/008595.wav|that he acknowledges everything that he's getting
data/005007.wav|if the price and pretty much has to
data/021617.wav|so if you're in pretty solid or above you probably got your money's worth given how many people saw it but if you're below that's where it gets risky so we're going to start off with a really interesting ad the
data/009618.wav|yeah what he was looking for and tyler
data/002593.wav|heads or tails heads or tails
data/012563.wav|by the way paper hands it was literally like the peak i couldn't have sold at a better time if
data/028292.wav|every friday at twitch we would have these all hands meetings where everybody in the company would come out to the like the cafeteria area and our ceo would talk and answer questions and in general these uh these questions were kind of
data/000224.wav|it have to call the lady back and order another one which is a is an
data/006912.wav|please do not get fired because you
data/020732.wav|the year we enter the final four and if you guys are fans of marketing monday awards the mondays then you know
data/008467.wav|i but you're not my longest sub it's certainly
data/016210.wav|what's up marketing man i got a five
data/009271.wav|be commenting on every single thing you hear about from nvidia because that
data/024248.wav|isn't there but i think as an ad i don't think you watch that
data/022037.wav|i said he just didn't know he thought the guy was walking away people were calling for
data/021561.wav|there's this could go really high
data/024807.wav|one lol skins and that's the big
data/028995.wav|i'm doing a cheerless right now streamers i can beat and hand-to-hand combat stupid idea there are not to put me bitch you are on i'm doing a tearless right now streamers i can beat in hand to hand combat
data/027342.wav|if the and ring players who have negative reaction speeds it will be a filter and then they followed up by replying to their own tweet and finding someone else who
data/022300.wav|damn who mega lol him dude
data/017660.wav|the the packaging they have a secretive
data/027841.wav|get it back and burns the money every quarter
data/003279.wav|in spain both day and night
data/023012.wav|with secret code that would only trigger at a later date so when it got reviewed by
data/030586.wav|oh my god there's 200 people
data/002682.wav|i should have had him walk away
data/003300.wav|well let me get kind of serious for
data/009951.wav|where are the explorer thank you for the six months alberto
data/009947.wav|it's you guys are not you guys don't like nuance
data/031382.wav|for delivery to the boat that the
data/028189.wav|if the tournament it had it had the
data/025189.wav|even though mcdonald's has like a
data/008970.wav|i made a bunch of them and all of them seem to
data/013261.wav|one twitch you're not on twitch like that
data/012449.wav|i already got into it ari got into it
data/001010.wav|well factor partner she loves factor males as
data/023019.wav|and they needed this to happen
data/021123.wav|it's funny because the executive that pitched this is the
data/026600.wav|it's january 20th with new episodes every
data/005685.wav|one thing about carl jacobs right now that
data/007084.wav|it would love to take that picture
data/022385.wav|oh my god can you believe red bull created this
data/030254.wav|in a joke yo boy when you
data/031012.wav|we're starting to like i thought maybe you'd fix the mold
data/027237.wav|that is causing a unique brand to emerge and so um this kind of summed it up
data/029937.wav|it's super awesome compared to any other esport i really respect that because especially watching the dock and seeing
data/024268.wav|morpheus never sang it wasn't like a character
data/010652.wav|clint's oh yeah so clint oh yeah so clint so yeah
data/020571.wav|can we all have a moment of silence for the
data/021987.wav|very intelligent guy a very smart guy i don't think he's
data/022847.wav|just buzzwords just trash buzzwords the
data/004865.wav|work tesla basically trying to cut
data/022611.wav|if you've ever seen before gamers
data/021533.wav|like losing all that money it's a sacrifice there's no way
data/031599.wav|wife and i was so nervous you can just hear it i was so nervous and team liquid said they would they would they would pay for my accommodations
data/005239.wav|and i get to the back of it
data/005974.wav|i didn't know i didn't know he was actually good at
data/004775.wav|and including and especially not limited to uh tesla which dropped about
data/021408.wav|so you have to buy stock you have to buy it immediately so you have some to give back that you borrowed okay so with all
data/019530.wav|how did he write this it's so impressive
data/006146.wav|and got a point same as me certainly didn't let me down
data/026015.wav|into the public domain he created this nice little rhyme red shirt on the bear artist beware if
data/027152.wav|the depression the unfortunate thing for biden specifically is that it looks like it's finally happening it looks like the chickens are coming to roost and so he's sort of getting hit with this
data/007127.wav|you know you're a little more touchy about that stuff and and whatever the point is that's the
data/008992.wav|really appreciate that and it's an honor to have the cutting edge
data/015789.wav|just like they're like skeleton crew small operated services that
data/010360.wav|and then after that of course we're going to get into the real meat and potatoes of the stream which is
data/007414.wav|add a great time i feel like it's hard to have a bad time although i will say if you are uncomfortable i think you should go with some friends if you are like a friend you should go you can go completely alone but it's hard it's
data/027572.wav|out of a lot of money let's just take the
data/015150.wav|this is where they are now this is where they are now so
data/017735.wav|or packaging this focus has what led them
data/000542.wav|like you know i know he's doing incredibly well
data/018818.wav|if things don't hold up about it and it is
data/032390.wav|it so much easier than in a pantheon my first attempt and for many of my first attempts i was
data/016030.wav|got their app it's the link in
data/022704.wav|the rise of snapchat and other companies at this time was now eating heavily in
data/014960.wav|at the cost of upgrading my pc i could
data/023980.wav|it's only fans okay they're not stupid they are fully aware that the money their cash cow is sex workers titties being out makes them
data/003980.wav|keep your head bare not your treasury
data/010904.wav|with the quickly is that is that i am
data/022492.wav|corporate april fool's jokes and find
data/019230.wav|families but as a teenage boy was like damn dude you guys know in Japan like
data/011660.wav|his luck that's pretty much luck i
data/029643.wav|it'll be they're gonna play this little song
data/018502.wav|are not doing that well sony owns a movie studio i don't know if you guys know that the the
data/027121.wav|the great financial crisis happened we were set for a pretty big depression and what stopped it
data/027502.wav|financially towards this sale happening and that that gives me an interesting point of view because i want to talk to you about sort of what led to this moment you guys probably heard a lot of
data/018889.wav|i agree with most of your ratings
data/030947.wav|what the first verse yeah i know it
data/001924.wav|i they pay me well i it's it's
data/008171.wav|but back then the prizes were like mouse pads and you know 80 bucks
data/013456.wav|never stop the grind once married
data/019682.wav|did you have any future jingles playing
data/008150.wav|what's actually been disabled it's actually
data/028627.wav|there was only like also by the way when he made this bet there's only like two weeks left in the season okay
data/019001.wav|which she as part of her storyline joined this is her as a child wow look at
data/011205.wav|that's what that's the best part
data/031694.wav|well the japanese changed my life that sounds like
data/022884.wav|you don't have to be a redditor to say fortnite sucks and that was actually apple's lawyer
data/001757.wav|the moral of the one where the guy seals the
data/003585.wav|new businesses start um there's there's there's
data/023603.wav|but you know the really sad part is that none of these workers
data/013132.wav|what the europeans call battle soccer
data/021793.wav|really solid i'm gonna put it in solid number nine on youtube trending
data/007859.wav|you guys what's going on today but i also
data/007506.wav|if the mushrooms not like 10 mushrooms i'm talking about
data/026754.wav|it's the consolidation like this it becomes a big race to buy up every available asset these are the big ones that are on the table
data/006890.wav|you know whatever it had everything dude
data/004810.wav|it's played as written there's no real weaseling out and if he is on the hook for
data/010957.wav|the cheese blaster are your nachos looking
data/027347.wav|we should call this all out as cringe
data/024579.wav|or that much but apple is fully within their right to ban you from the app store for life which they're doing so apple in response
data/013460.wav|lot to learn from that and i think we should all take lessons
data/015897.wav|every monopoly would we and there this is
data/029036.wav|and all just instant reaction push him kind of
data/028598.wav|later on in the season they just don't have a later on snapchat but this is at least
data/021084.wav|due to the point of it it's like your aliens who like lord about marketing from watching it from a distance you try to you to the point of it it's like your aliens who like learned
data/017951.wav|domino's pizza was the best performing stock of the
data/014267.wav|ever seen in my entire life it it's just i i i i
data/007389.wav|with the scene that's my that's my
data/010671.wav|practicing the new maps playing with whoever maybe maybe
data/025756.wav|it's public awareness ads always feel like they can go to extreme shock value because they have no corporation
data/015742.wav|it's awesome and if they keep in the service for the next 18 months we're going to
data/028979.wav|or gummy bear after gummy bear
data/008434.wav|i think talks like this and then we're gonna
data/025785.wav|but more importantly they have nothing to announce this is the key thing i guarantee you if
data/000549.wav|so i had thought about that but i'm not
data/030080.wav|i'm talking about my parents i'm talking
data/027383.wav|and so powerful they can go back to these companies they've been ripping off and kind of make them pay
data/012912.wav|it really fun time but i thought
data/024628.wav|now as i recall a large portion of my chatter said what i'm a zoomer i don't like this
data/006396.wav|that take a chance on them you know that give give them the opportunity to succeed even when they're starting from the bottom and that's why i want to give another win to the company bolt
data/005327.wav|i thought there was like security right it's like
data/000490.wav|i enough blt gets here uh they they
data/023807.wav|out there bro that's literally quack that's literally quack editing the video youtube commenters
data/019804.wav|if the original kickstarter campaign it was critically panned it was boring it was pretty bad it looked like an amateur game
data/027477.wav|i think that's all for my
data/027523.wav|i always wondered that and then when this deal came out this
data/008902.wav|the end of the day this is mostly not a political thing at all like this is basically a contract negotiation from a guy that just overpaid for something and
data/005695.wav|that is not a disney kid at all i mean yeah he's not a disney kid at all i mean
data/028194.wav|and so they had to cancel the tournament and everyone was like we already
data/022431.wav|in about saying cool people young creative attractive lucky people use our product and out of date wife hates them businessman uses their product they
data/003909.wav|i mean these people kind of
data/002690.wav|at all there's no way to lose and there is no downside i'm
data/009510.wav|this is over in the ground dead and buried
data/004309.wav|maybe your ears are off everything about that dare pause and say
data/008813.wav|his own dollars to get nothing to slightly hurt twitter
data/027239.wav|the is elden ring designed well discourse
data/009799.wav|says that our country may be headed for the worst economic crisis since the founding of the federal republic of germany frederick
data/021551.wav|well all the time so now this has happened the rich guys are
data/028421.wav|star general he was almost at
data/009429.wav|watch this whole game i just kind of wanted to
data/024848.wav|i was playing the ladder i would lose to
data/032204.wav|watch then then we get greedy we're so confident we're so up we go to a
data/023785.wav|if it was a truck i guess i could see the association oh it's calgary oh oh
data/008100.wav|he sticks with us through thick and thin and that's true
data/008709.wav|as five percent i i feel like
data/016129.wav|i'll see you when i see you i might do a stream with my family around christmas i'll give you guys
data/011225.wav|at the standard you know what i'm saying that's
data/002149.wav|things will happen on that day that are not related
data/012820.wav|i told the story a couple
data/002444.wav|you're the person i have in mind
data/010666.wav|if you guys don't know my smite name
data/031850.wav|what is only a little bit smaller than riot games riot games
data/011120.wav|in bluetooth broke so i can't use
data/031428.wav|you know just say things that you know boys being boys apparently the kids heard the kids by the way were full german so i
data/016812.wav|at comments on youtube where i say remember this when no one had their phones
data/015142.wav|yeah you could you could sell it to
data/027329.wav|why making less people able to beat it it feels more accomplishing for those that do now the downside of that is this as the game has gotten more accessible and
data/007363.wav|if the things never doing it again
data/007958.wav|we're going to do today so i have a marketing monday
data/031049.wav|they might not find me again dude
data/020347.wav|if the idea it's a really clever idea opening
data/000137.wav|that was your big joke if i can find
data/025283.wav|the ride in a movie and um
data/006259.wav|have you seen the hassan reaction to your video which video
data/009110.wav|they're reading to their 16 year old
data/029603.wav|the there used to be yeah yeah yeah
data/009882.wav|right now but moving to europe
data/027293.wav|there are two things one is communal shared experience so it being difficult and being the same for every single person that plays it that means if you and i both beat it you know that we accomplish the same thing there's
data/026050.wav|so long term the company is already working with preschools to establish the foundation of tech education so that as our hiring demand
data/029144.wav|he ate pokemon red i looked at it like
data/027891.wav|yeah there's been a collapse in malls you can actually set up a business in a
data/010221.wav|it didn't tell my friends and one
data/009171.wav|cut out of 10 video it
data/010124.wav|does not look like he is taking it well
data/025860.wav|but when you're a big game company it starts to look bad year after year when everybody
data/023179.wav|well i'm like why doesn't mine
data/001876.wav|logged out like incognito just to see
data/014103.wav|in build up my computer i've used lotus
data/030427.wav|which the most interesting man in the world she was like the most interesting woman in the world like she literally had like like she just was nice but also cool like i think she had like it all figured
data/025240.wav|well the couldn't play would start to watch
data/003035.wav|as like it was like very very quick everyone in the theater like had the same thought and it was a mass panic and that was that was really interesting to me was how quickly everyone went from like
data/016363.wav|but now investigators say hundreds of billions have been lost
data/020886.wav|is off the ground is going to be more stressful
data/021153.wav|from metro wow so tell me more about
data/001399.wav|in the trivia question and if they get it right i'll give
data/014601.wav|bad idea it would be too late
data/017970.wav|i did on sunday made any money it was like all just
data/005711.wav|like playing with them and so
data/019757.wav|now i'm excited for it i think it may live up to expectations but they are high so in honor of this big release we're going to go through the top
data/008647.wav|what if he doesn't pay now that's interesting i love that question that's the real question so i don't think the question is whether or not the court's going to side with
data/009129.wav|i have more children dude it's crazy i
data/007833.wav|i can't say it again because the moment's
data/005073.wav|ideally ideally we get some sort of consequences for this guy um that you
data/031853.wav|room and it's about the same bro it's about the same it's worse when it comes to
data/014260.wav|we can cut it back for the video
data/023040.wav|the changes let me give you
data/007384.wav|well as outsiders think that way uh like
data/002158.wav|or camouflaged with similar coloring second thing is how in squid game the walls in red light green light are fake walls with the sky on them and on some fall guys maps if you look at the sky you see pixelated hexagons instead of
data/024101.wav|youtube commenter on my channel because i now have a new goat that's right bad boy halo watched my hitman vid that's right i'm in the dream smp now
data/002383.wav|ambrose island brand new map new targets
data/015949.wav|if you look back after the end of the month and
data/027946.wav|one share for a dollar you can do that and then see
data/021903.wav|or this let's say for example i stay up really late
data/022401.wav|do the next one number three
data/005917.wav|i guarantee valkyrie does not know that i was the
data/028832.wav|at one point i don't know if i told this
data/016332.wav|need a contract to keep taking dubs
data/030962.wav|would like to let you know that i am muting
data/004235.wav|a lot of financial sense and everyone's like
data/030272.wav|the dog on it but in
data/018221.wav|if the the commercial which is crazy um
data/018193.wav|hyundai like sunday and that enough has got hyundai in your mind first of all as one
data/020922.wav|does quite well and if i had said
data/018974.wav|the where they live and we'll make it better
data/032174.wav|and then i lose it and i
data/023206.wav|white grape juice unfinished pear extract like a bunch of
data/025346.wav|this guy was on the set and i literally
data/025408.wav|only seen the first five seconds
data/015436.wav|but this is i wanted to have him holding the
data/029168.wav|and they ended up purchasing a firestone instead and blew the rest of their money
data/011726.wav|okay we're gonna have to watch it vertically stupid oh god damn it okay
data/017195.wav|the of that i am a hero little do you know
data/014467.wav|say is he agonized over the decision for a very long time you can also watch
data/021288.wav|bacon drops juice the viewership make it the number one game guaranteed people
data/028362.wav|and one of the ones i took the longest time to try to not say is true north i think true north
data/001719.wav|the one that really stuck with me
data/031447.wav|it's around on the rocks as he's grabbing the
data/007569.wav|was like it was like it was
data/024264.wav|sort of like having him be exactly like the
data/010845.wav|why you need add poke and doesn't matter
data/030316.wav|as the pastor was asking he was like you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded what like
data/003864.wav|as this and like getting his point across but they just can't get on message he doesn't he just doesn't look
data/004141.wav|and so he's doing all that and
data/022402.wav|i say savings you can't skip this guy
data/020882.wav|don't have what it takes this is legit advice people who tell you to start a business are not thinking about what that means
data/002137.wav|something's up and i think is just the beginning i literally think people are
data/004468.wav|chicken bowl chicken bowl brown rice
data/025273.wav|and then it goes away and no one cares anymore but
data/002876.wav|so their follow-up case could be within a few weeks after that and also only take a few days so
data/026866.wav|with a seashell over and over and over and over again without without tying it back to
data/015989.wav|is anything good for consumers competition competition is good for consumers that's why right now in streaming services you're getting like
data/017135.wav|the monday i think we might be able
data/018389.wav|that is the truth for every business i'm trying to expand this a little bit so you guys
data/025527.wav|i billion in response to that there was a
data/031160.wav|and they were like oh man is he okay it's like bro you you're not okay
data/009554.wav|i wasn't there in time but he can't
data/024884.wav|if you are halfway through a
data/024634.wav|where it's going fingers on the pulse
data/028020.wav|it's still he's still not yet a
data/018788.wav|i work in marketing professionally I
data/026029.wav|in an ironic one something might have gone wrong in
data/031130.wav|be good at games right he just worked harder
data/002407.wav|the can sort of put my pst language into esd
data/016026.wav|why we did the marketing monday i thank you
data/015833.wav|or philly d than you are to see cable news
data/031980.wav|i want to hire you so in his words his own words i
data/030545.wav|and then he gets to the air room and again this is like you
data/015723.wav|this episode of marketing money on the streaming services although i'm open to answering any questions and also just
data/008177.wav|what he did but fxo paid
data/009842.wav|it's only in europe where that's even
data/014200.wav|ignore those basically pretend this this thing is
data/032282.wav|we take all our money we put
data/030398.wav|i never sounded more dead serious in my
data/000613.wav|i think about i would have been pissed
data/015948.wav|where's the same bill because you'll quit if you
data/012005.wav|one because they're talking to you directly
data/008054.wav|it's not like i could send it back in
data/009836.wav|the outsells every other car or truck by a
data/021752.wav|which business has been real good to me but now i got this
data/016525.wav|all of this is highly correlated with viewership as viewership goes up
data/005636.wav|that he was different for a moment that's why i was so shocked that he
data/029608.wav|if the that iconoclasm iconoclasm that's a new
data/022813.wav|app which i'm sure will rise even more to the moon like gamestop stock at this point they decided they wanted to go shopping and they found a sucker let me show you this man this man was the ceo of time warner communications and because of the magic of
data/028294.wav|with plans to expand the vod feature
data/008268.wav|the early games like quake you know maybe even doom tribes
data/017251.wav|we doing anything get a deal with walgreens roll out your fake blood testing
data/011700.wav|but anyway so we show up and we see the
data/014243.wav|with better vods they can grow hours
data/003272.wav|easy it's not hard to find a
data/024423.wav|and was kind of blown away at
data/007204.wav|well if he's interested i'll sponsor
data/013716.wav|i look at what this guy did and in every other game for the dawn of time
data/031582.wav|ambushes it in the middle of
data/031032.wav|and she just had bad allergies or she's sick
data/019485.wav|what the commercials that's a problem now you have
data/024242.wav|it has to be for a specific product that's
data/026379.wav|it's competitors so them investing in the purchase and post-purchase areas of the clock have generated outside rewards another area is that all
data/008758.wav|it and then you get pulled out on so
data/032362.wav|actually when i opened it again
data/017059.wav|thank you so much two months later
data/011009.wav|let me open up balloons and see what's
data/027647.wav|if the biggest take on this whole situation is not that you know i don't
data/027478.wav|elon musk has purchased twitter for
data/007592.wav|if he gets a big boy
data/024302.wav|yeah i mean it turned out great i
data/014850.wav|is that you own and make your game popular the real problem larger than this is that ubisoft's games
data/007509.wav|it starts to dig in dude
data/009805.wav|of money for bread no no no they're they're not experiencing that and the
data/016723.wav|at a fight which means remote work stuff is here to stay at least for some portion of the public permanently there's just no way they are going to they're going to be kicking and screaming back to the office because of how much additional time they receive with their family friends kids etc and so
data/021878.wav|they said he showed up with more security than the president
data/019935.wav|that's the idea okay number one this is acquisitions not mergers so for example
data/015631.wav|tech companies are just so much richer nbc is not amazon
data/029118.wav|all talking about it it was such
data/020873.wav|too risky what if there's a hurricane if
data/015739.wav|they'll release a new show that
data/018379.wav|it's and he owned the paid sites
data/024542.wav|want to subscribe to me on ios if you do it through the twitch app on ios apple gets a cut but if you just go to the web
data/001238.wav|if you could they can't hurt i'm just saying i think
data/026353.wav|hi this is very common and it
data/024703.wav|use the money to pay for their debts on the real estate side and basically shuddered how will this global collapse impact my channel points they'll be more valuable
data/012575.wav|and you know whenever you sign up you get a free stock and then i get a free stock for referring you
data/002234.wav|you know it's just like he would have
data/025311.wav|but i'm also not a fan of crypto and i know a lot of you especially zoomers just think
data/009642.wav|i mean we're gonna get this late our champ
data/023153.wav|it's all like i've been working out but like i still feel like i'm not good enough i
data/029501.wav|good the gods were when he you know the friend of the producer famous scene
data/028086.wav|steve jobs has never been less enthused in his entire life he hates the product
data/020070.wav|it's definitely not where all my
data/022652.wav|you've settled into an intense gaming session you're just getting to the good part and
data/028926.wav|well let me share my story without feeling
data/014768.wav|he jumped in to save you stormer thank
data/013095.wav|we're at the time a little bit which is uh three
data/012300.wav|in goofily she got her bb-8 droid her dad
data/011691.wav|i literally tell myself that oh
data/008533.wav|you know a lot of you probably know tyson foods it's on it the logos on a lot of frozen food you can buy
data/029113.wav|the numbers are up and then everyone
data/027174.wav|i love that that's actually a good idea how about us millennials anyone
data/027315.wav|extremely important to them in that way do you know what i'm saying in a world where it's hard to make progress on things and accomplish things which is true
data/020200.wav|i saw one that was like a worker in my hometown had to pee but they wouldn't let him because he was on the grill in a rush
data/013124.wav|at his expense i don't think you got any of it
data/021414.wav|well this one because it was professional investors doing it instead of wall street beds and at this point
data/009625.wav|i'm playing for 10 years i'll
data/025276.wav|every single one of those combined does not add up to the popularity of squid games and
data/014552.wav|job but like begin exploratory talks but my twitch contract is not in a place currently where i could even think about looking at other offers so
data/027517.wav|instead of building really nice building all these people are engineers almost all
data/004191.wav|the choice that i've made but i've decided
data/028280.wav|so that's my that's the only
data/025905.wav|apologize and apologize and apologize and until people like for some reason forgave them they just dropped something cool and that's the equivalent of kobe starting to shoot
data/022995.wav|we don't intend to make money off the app store the app store makes a
data/013956.wav|it'll be like hey you want another
data/019488.wav|the youtube content right now why
data/026166.wav|if this will save blizzard thank god riot is quaking in their boots
data/005857.wav|at the end of the day no one got hurt extra emily's got all the money and it's doing
data/004130.wav|i looked into it myself it's like it's it's like the biggest subsidy to intel
data/028919.wav|symbol that i was so visibly drunk apparently we walked back with a number of friends though the major last piece of the
data/005166.wav|well it was all me holding my phone
data/018282.wav|in the dust jacket was written by a.i and
data/021534.wav|going to be like all the poor people
data/009671.wav|it'll get smarter i'm doing a big stream
data/029287.wav|the world yo this brings me back so when i was
data/020228.wav|i first went out from sos
data/027284.wav|in a gucci belt and bucket cap and
data/022631.wav|one because i don't think i don't think you'll be angry and i was like well you
data/002818.wav|no way he could have done it this is a
data/027679.wav|to figure out how to make this company somehow profitable and somehow get a return on this massive amount of
data/001324.wav|this guy's legit no i believe it i
data/011468.wav|update um i didn't get it but someone
data/024781.wav|it is now officially a habit in your brain that is difficult to break next thing they'll do and this was baffling i
data/018575.wav|whoever wins the next generation could win forever it probably it's either the next
data/027619.wav|when he's battery makers are major supply specials
data/006580.wav|what i'm saying it's like it's like a last sweep
data/010314.wav|all my team i should say awake joe lively
data/021681.wav|it's like a certain character we can't legally name from the office
data/024435.wav|the worst one of the 3d ones but
data/001296.wav|i'm sure they'd have a million views but they
data/024202.wav|isn't that was hurt was like i guess ninja's
data/008251.wav|one of the very first twitch employees
data/001590.wav|oh it's all about me i got him you're a child oh pwned sir sorry but you've been officially
data/005754.wav|at one point later in the conversation i remember specifically it was like i
data/028805.wav|i was like well just don't
data/014396.wav|so that that this is one thing that
data/023170.wav|the trend for this has gotten so bad marketers basically noticed that if you add grill marks it sells better and so now often frozen food is delivered to grocery stores with grill marks painted on so when you buy this has never touched
data/010039.wav|at it i've said it i've seen
data/004125.wav|well that's my that's my takeaway
data/013581.wav|trying to figure it all out i'm
data/018544.wav|important because these are expensive acquisitions
data/021774.wav|with their relationship that she has to lie about eating cheetos and then how stupid is ashton or how stupid does mila think she
data/030914.wav|what nor his mother i thought nobody was listening
data/008018.wav|while the exploring this one i like i i just i think about exploring
data/028632.wav|literally two weeks my work suffered
data/028062.wav|your pocket is one of the best taglines of all time it
data/015288.wav|i video bigger than all of them combined there is more stuff on prime video than any other streaming service it's not all good stuff they've got a bunch of random shows from the
data/014961.wav|i could deduct um everything i spend on quack
data/014829.wav|yeah this is it ubisoft appears to have sold a grand total of
data/003973.wav|you guys are getting scud missile
data/031177.wav|we don't feel sorry for anyone with this much money but if ludwig had been this big two years earlier he would have made a hundred million
data/028930.wav|up the next day and it's weird because i feel good i don't have a hangover i wake up the next day i think it's the morning it's actually
data/006940.wav|how many days i take off
data/007237.wav|you know it's like day of and i'm like hey where are you i can give you the hat
data/019803.wav|i came out it wasn't really anything like the concept art
data/010122.wav|can dip gang good tip king
data/001813.wav|it's called visionaries the visionaries podcast and i was like
data/030571.wav|in and eating we're not out
data/012607.wav|it did not give me five racks back so they're
data/027469.wav|but a great question would be asking why are world leaders why the earth is now losing
data/003941.wav|and they run the movie back in theaters
data/031775.wav|yes sir and contribute a little bit of the uh storyline that we can kind of dig
data/008681.wav|get the whole thing thrown out but if they're a real company and they just have slightly more or less
data/022274.wav|cause i died from an accident
data/010071.wav|i have been using factor meals for like
data/003197.wav|he's on the straight and narrow there is no way that is a ponzi scheme so we're certain finally
data/024876.wav|if they didn't give it to him they all
data/023893.wav|oh man dude it's such a branching point if you guys don't know zayn came into grand finals
data/021396.wav|which is also illegal naked shorts are illegal but there's like loopholes that billionaires can use to find a way to do it and when it got right around here this is not wall street bets yet some smart investors like michael
data/014180.wav|and it's not just on money it's on it's on like hours streamed it's things like
data/026636.wav|the half so they have in cash just sitting around in cash the value of sony this is
data/005155.wav|me tell you one thing about the very nice woman at the nail salon she was not familiar with the
data/000769.wav|it obviously obviously obviously obviously we're not going to do it though i think an idea where let's say a less i
data/007781.wav|we are like very close to
data/021897.wav|is boring okay but the general idea is it's like a wheel where everything on the wheel makes the next thing easier and it should loop back to the original thing that's the idea i think like this all the time for a lot of things and i'm
data/003164.wav|it's hot new buzzword the metaverse was very exciting and they changed their entire company name but it turns out it's
data/006256.wav|so be there okay be there or miss one of
data/000806.wav|at the hundreds back and then once i have that fat wallet
data/026024.wav|i can get three free months of mint
data/004673.wav|you know i took the road less traveled by
data/017778.wav|you get your sub red he remembers your
data/013850.wav|in this they didn't steal it

data/008245.wav|in eight dollars a year making eight dollars an article and
data/031963.wav|i feel like crazy for almost all the jokes but it
data/023264.wav|at the next time you assume your taste buds are up to the task although i'll be honest with you so i've seen that video and i um ari my fiance always talks about
data/025151.wav|tall glasses of ice water oh no this is not a win i'm sorry i call

data/005832.wav|at the dinner where he claimed to not care about
data/014924.wav|it's incoming i'm not going to get it i've
data/006481.wav|it means is we can stop a recession by all going to strip clubs non-stop as long as we keep the
data/025728.wav|for the modern internet that's the way things spread nowadays the best piece of advice i got was literally design content for a group chat it is it is though it is way
data/012739.wav|put the time in and you always get more
data/007320.wav|so i was taking a lot of these bets and
data/005905.wav|but still it was a big deal it was a big deal
data/004708.wav|of the one month anniversary of the time i spent
data/005684.wav|and i actually had a blast those guys are
data/015430.wav|disney okay they have stars they have an absolute massive bench of beloved beloved ip right now the biggest franchise in the world is marvel okay like
data/013067.wav|but i just got interested in i was thinking about it
data/006091.wav|that's why it's hilarious i'm sorry
data/017637.wav|an apple store costs about nine million
data/014282.wav|if they get s3k the war is over
data/014242.wav|at platform youtube is smoother than twitch
data/029126.wav|it's a new emo because i was literally there at the
data/012899.wav|me to meet my future boss at which in-person and charm enough to me to meet my future boss at twitch in person
data/022591.wav|i would be like off the charts controls your game character and with the waterproof earphones you
data/003552.wav|i don't think it's productive for the person or for anyone like i i don't think it helps you but it's one way to cope i guess
data/029944.wav|i ever heard i'm sure on his wedding day or when his kid is
data/017675.wav|and it's noticeable right it is a noticeable difference now microsoft in
data/018570.wav|and in the next one xbox one was a flop
data/003631.wav|and it's dated on a certain time period that
data/016746.wav|as solution for this part of environment and i think uh people that are investing
data/030760.wav|let me tell you i was walking around
data/004781.wav|at all the hassle of running twitter and he certainly didn't want to put all of his wealth that was
data/008024.wav|when i was reading marketing material about skyrim and like it's gonna be it's
data/022220.wav|through the land of our childhood
data/023443.wav|be sure to check them out when you hear the word branding as a marketer or
data/023847.wav|i just want to shout out my
data/027769.wav|what that was a while ago and people get better they improve their craft you
data/032376.wav|it was so much harder so i made a reply
data/015939.wav|it's like it's not relevant to the other companies just just netflix
data/005091.wav|i think it's an awful business but i use twitter a good amount and
data/015092.wav|wasn't stars movies tv shows to be cut netflix started losing all
data/022173.wav|oh my god that's that is
data/002803.wav|welcome to marketing monday on monday
data/017696.wav|a lot of money on a product uh the fact they felt
data/029978.wav|you been number one before is that
data/002519.wav|heads or tails you're hurt yeah i'm hurt having to read your goddamn
data/002895.wav|it's something i'll be updating on week after week but that's
data/030287.wav|the judge products based on results i should be thanking him because it was literally the best shampoo i've ever had my hair looked so bouncy and boisterous and shiny it was fantastic on the low if it wasn't so shamed by society i would go buy some
data/012505.wav|i think it's slightly too expensive i think probably at half the cost it's pretty good
data/000414.wav|degenerate fast coin flip game of all time so i put
data/028914.wav|so we go outside and i begin to vomit furiously i vomit left i
data/000230.wav|and i don't need to explain what
data/002655.wav|the serengeti mixed with an anime
data/030634.wav|we should probably practice or like learn something and
data/023097.wav|things to try and create a picture in our minds and that is what marketers take advantage of
data/007107.wav|not interest to the only thing you watch and
data/017284.wav|from a certain mouse about this poo very very
data/025606.wav|right it's not really right well first of all big reason netflix no longer a top dog but luckily we can change netflix to nvidia
data/012412.wav|it has come out and like point their guns at
data/027729.wav|blunt and chill we ninjas fam he's fighting right
data/020128.wav|it's to get pepsi sales up this
data/026691.wav|if the and remember thinking was really stupid now
data/012127.wav|day is the idea they're going for was good it's just
data/025654.wav|your investment in three hours by five it was worth nearly three thousand dollars a coin by
data/019858.wav|the first part of this is the matrix online this game came out
data/013336.wav|that involved a lot of oreos
data/004562.wav|it was a little bright huh
data/022065.wav|political controversial just make sure whose account
data/004302.wav|i literally can hear what i'm saying
data/027607.wav|big crypto side then there's the employees that are threatening to quit and
data/006233.wav|it's kind of scary for me
data/031477.wav|he couldn't afford that house that we stayed in he couldn't afford that's how that's how
data/001804.wav|your life but the vibe will not be live
data/006862.wav|like me with who that in the back area
data/021226.wav|was which is the office plus like bonus office features
data/018162.wav|it tested by pepsi this has gone from funny to sad hey look
data/028090.wav|his keynote they decided to start making their own phone which led to the iphone
data/006751.wav|we go together i love darman
data/011624.wav|after she watched it now she's like a
data/008996.wav|get aaron i love i can't i can't
data/032233.wav|it's like it's like in slow motion i watched him walk to the atm pull out literally
data/023191.wav|okay so you can make it up the first
data/030468.wav|if the mood here all right
data/032214.wav|in sort of go all in at the end and we get to about
data/013676.wav|you would do a different name sounds weird
data/013992.wav|that's amazing it really works but
data/018844.wav|i first laid eyes on you I told myself she's the one and then why
data/030613.wav|i was in fourth grade i was on a military base a nato military base that means the militaries from every
data/021169.wav|for some of you it will look like this with money flying from the sky
data/016917.wav|the said that kev dog man bear
data/028045.wav|because all these different stores starbucks union workers are actually starting to make real progress on the other hand a more scary enemy is amazon so i mentioned recently that amazon had a very big union win recently
data/017665.wav|and quality and and packaging when you open the iphone and open the ipad
data/026143.wav|kept making accounts kept getting banned
data/011390.wav|if thousand dollars from me because i am about five to six thousand dollars poorer than i was on friday and i'm
data/016100.wav|well definitely say yes to the promo
data/012153.wav|i didn't get the full video it was crazy because right after she said that
data/004580.wav|we're not my son but i will give you a high
data/027553.wav|then the day it was set to happen the morning it was
data/014341.wav|every one of these nuclear bombs is something that these guys or these guys needs to pick up before the other one whoever steals the other side's nuclear bombs first is going to win this war that is my opinion okay so youtube looking for their own version of twitch prime very smart twitch trying to get their own rewind feature and good
data/008911.wav|i could supposed to just edit videos and so i have paid pay the musician
data/032041.wav|i thought i would be drowned out with laughter and they did laugh but it wasn't it wasn't loud enough to drown me out and so you could see me get nervous is when
data/032056.wav|that d1 would buy these huge hotels
data/022827.wav|the company will come from your company and yet your shareholders will
data/010442.wav|anyway i didn't read his name so you'll never know
data/005647.wav|the next day after the nails thing with connor after i get my
data/028904.wav|at the door and up a
data/020486.wav|they also made the witcher adventure board game
data/013268.wav|acs records even in this bit no they don't
data/000918.wav|my friend let's get my negotiating
data/014808.wav|i have only one major fail and it is the saga told entirely through kotaku articles of
data/010268.wav|which also means mango is not
data/022806.wav|the online so you might notice a couple
data/011824.wav|when you get on they they turn your
data/005883.wav|similar their streams in person but also
data/029280.wav|oh yeah marketing mondays my my monday
data/007826.wav|the the magnifying glasses stare deeply at the
data/002276.wav|i would get a lot of earned media it's actually not an insane idea
data/031171.wav|he cares about that stuff he wants to be number one that's his goal and he hit it and i'm
data/012902.wav|but in terms of actual decisions that had real thought
data/023268.wav|i can't and uh so i concocted a taste test
data/032413.wav|nothing in this game is harder than like it's like about
data/006739.wav|big block letters dude it was like
data/014238.wav|i know that people on this
data/022637.wav|those are actual bleeps those are actual
data/015797.wav|why doesn't disney just buy marketing
data/008015.wav|dark souls obviously i mean like the
data/018178.wav|so most car commercials are not designed to appeal to a cracked out zoomer fortnite audience put on your boomer hats today the average
data/028149.wav|also on their ability to get the deal through which is bad because they were relying on some of the cash that was in that boring company when they merged they get the cashes in the boring company and
data/021612.wav|in football how cool is that that shows you how much
data/020222.wav|durex launches a revolutionary new app
data/026684.wav|in dollars back now that being said my understanding is that bobby
data/001933.wav|both of these things but i don't like the fact that i'm not having much time for anything else so i'm thinking about that but i have no no immediate plans to to do anything
data/027192.wav|and he was assigned to the game
data/004621.wav|to expect a certain level of revenue and profit
data/018999.wav|self created from the ground up seraphine timed
data/025141.wav|the copy is peanut butter more like
data/026011.wav|if the public domain you can make this cool matrix poo you can draw weird
data/028974.wav|so i took this back to my dorm room and i stared at it just like just give it a stare down dude
data/029948.wav|he throws ice at children man he goes nuts good times
data/003749.wav|the people to jail the executive doesn't go
data/004682.wav|coffee cow what are you talking about
data/027281.wav|at how difficult it was they've leaned into it
data/027831.wav|i want every year so they used to make 35
data/015558.wav|well they'll allow the losses for too much longer
data/014860.wav|the this is a win for millennials we got our first millennial president of chile who apparently announced as he got elected that he's a swifty let's go
data/016882.wav|every year even with sports and
data/031092.wav|cause i remember me and st
data/000708.wav|like he he he convinced me
data/004056.wav|as your employees or the government they're always trying to take the money you earn from playing
data/016640.wav|if you're in a low cost location like say arizona they're already cheaper than currently built fossil power plants by
data/006050.wav|it's like dude this is a wendy's it's like
data/014436.wav|so that's that's where we're going with this and so they really want to win this and whoever takes the lead
data/002141.wav|the country and every country all the time
data/008558.wav|and so the contract that he signs first of all had a period before he signed it called discovery where you can ask any questions about the business get any data kick the tires you know figure out what
data/000232.wav|wins everyone wins you all make money
data/031551.wav|what i think is considered the greatest
data/023888.wav|this is a good market this
data/014274.wav|going to continue to spend money and they're going to continue with their new
data/022620.wav|don't get banned get ron's who is this
data/026637.wav|is the entire value of sony now i want to
data/021318.wav|these trends are real okay you look at it look at rust

data/016113.wav|what is left to do today do i wrap here is there anything
data/030971.wav|actually this is this is the big news in america and we
data/006232.wav|i just figured out that i like watching
data/022606.wav|i think there's two ways you can go with this
data/029439.wav|do you want to be an entertainer do you
data/016476.wav|it's early days before he founded amazon and
data/007171.wav|if you guys don't know i was talking about chic sheik's never ever ever won an event a

data/021375.wav|your 10 shares and i will give you
data/016793.wav|one for a long time the
data/020790.wav|i thought we could not even ourselves
data/030657.wav|if everyone's in the auditorium now now it was like sudden death when it got to the final two it was like the first one to get a question wrong if the other person gets it right is eliminated they start ask you to hard question after if everyone's in the auditorium now now it was like sudden death when it got to the final two it was like the first one to get a question wrong if the other person gets it right is eliminated they start asking hard question after hard question
data/008356.wav|where we just have a lot of jobs
data/005068.wav|you know what it feels like uh
data/012332.wav|but they were like okay you're
data/022438.wav|very different way to say pc users are losers and i think about them i think about how like you don't have to be too subtle that's the lesson i took from this as a marketer is that you really you don't have to
data/019417.wav|with the your votes and my knowledge the greatest marketing and the worst marketing jingles of all time first of
data/004084.wav|like i'm trying to spell it
data/026346.wav|apple video from the time of the ipod so it's like
data/023035.wav|for two reasons one they're just bigger they're just stronger and in general um the
data/000675.wav|and i'm drunk but it was and that was just him i also i also lost i was up you know probably
data/021441.wav|odd thing now but i have to be honest here and this is where people
data/012814.wav|like we were the best college team
data/018393.wav|the mclaren jeff bezos has a monopoly on being a hot
data/004947.wav|they were already losing 200 million
data/029961.wav|what do you mean you weren't
data/007029.wav|if the first time i got the trolls i
data/025972.wav|or life and time into it that they are
data/017370.wav|the somebody who really needs it though can i just give a win for a second to someone who's been struggling a group
data/025453.wav|a counterbalance all wins with fails the
data/027180.wav|what have i been obsessed with for the past week
data/003087.wav|what i was thinking was okay
data/005664.wav|false story because everyone was super duper
data/004044.wav|maybe i had a little something but i don't think i
data/021125.wav|like this is not the behind the
data/029222.wav|is like all right i got a job for you
data/001022.wav|you're lying you sent me a picture of four different
data/029666.wav|it's funny though is if it was a 401
data/005479.wav|walks up past me bumps me while i'm holding the
data/024437.wav|i they just made the pepsi float around him so i wasn't that impressed but it was still cool i mean it's still
data/014263.wav|it patiently well folks the day has come we're launching farmville in vr
data/004800.wav|billion dollars no regardless but the language
data/001374.wav|and join the you know i'll just
data/009562.wav|if the cameras there oh my
data/030159.wav|and i go back to lost so i lost
data/019201.wav|the made fun of for having a GameCube
data/021507.wav|but it's like this guy chris hedges
data/022045.wav|that's my thought that's my take but that means it's a very hot week for
data/003880.wav|and you know and also like there's like
data/031726.wav|to pretend to be the soldier
data/029363.wav|bread and water i don't want to i already come off like a kid with my riot gear so i order a meal that
data/000220.wav|but it was like it was from a cart with a lady that spent like an hour torching it it was like a really fancy one and so everyone else orders one of the exact same
data/018136.wav|this is what kendall jenner wanted
data/022981.wav|the butter knife to a gunfight shocking dozens these are all internal
data/030413.wav|my dog shampoo it just kept my hair
data/013005.wav|whether you know for the rest of the year yeah you'd
data/003414.wav|are not supported on anything um
data/025475.wav|what the few years ago when there was the rise of that do you guys remember that fortnite based mouse company final mouse
data/024655.wav|because now mining companies that make metals and things that might be
data/024964.wav|because people don't complain too much on social media they just actually hate the company what do you think the most hated brand in america is no the answer is uber
data/021707.wav|huggies i put it at the bottom of good it's a great
data/021939.wav|things like where you work where you live who you marry and who you prime to on twitch okay you should focus only on a few big things to stress about but the general idea is that most decisions in life are what he calls
data/023493.wav|truck month isn't even a consistent month you're right they just do truck
data/003329.wav|where people can switch jobs and leverage that to better pay and that many people are doing that right now and
data/001667.wav|why factor meals are the most delicious on earth and
data/032241.wav|oh of course baccarat that's how we get back at these
data/031580.wav|treat to get back to the base to save himself
data/005306.wav|always awkward i've been that person a million

data/032124.wav|push up your glasses thing before he tells a girl she has hpv
data/026953.wav|my mind i'm gonna have to give it uh
data/024711.wav|or stocks right now and what i'm noticing is if you compare it to this chart this is when they did all the buying no ethics outcry
data/024717.wav|the rebound and there's a period of growth and that's actually a good time to graduate and also you want to be
data/003293.wav|certain things obviously have been more expensive and some more expensive than others and one thing that has been particularly more expensive and we no longer have to worry about our family dragging us to is boring major league baseball games it's now much less likely that your
data/007258.wav|i was going to distract from like him making his breakout
data/010399.wav|chattanooga anyone who lives in chattanooga i envy you
data/006962.wav|it all adds up it all it's all

data/027057.wav|it's like and people went to the moon and people sailed uncharted waters and you can buy
data/029015.wav|you wouldn't beat him and you

data/025662.wav|so i don't think they'll get caught
data/018080.wav|death and toss a pepsi to men and women stuck on a roof of a burning building is that they that is
data/010941.wav|sheet pan parmesan chicken i have already made this me and ari already cooked it right
data/019015.wav|you can build it right in
data/027575.wav|when talking about whether or not he's
data/026616.wav|at the two billion minecraft remember that
data/004368.wav|four hours and for me that's true because i saw a
data/032126.wav|what noises all i'd have to do is dig up audio of your honeymoon night with sophie
data/017323.wav|it's many people this quickly if they keep up this growth they'll be the world's largest
data/004584.wav|come on come on come on come on come on we back we're back
data/012061.wav|it was done kind of early and then when it was over i didn't get invited to much of that stuff because i was on the evil track so the lightsaber guy who was the most
data/023993.wav|the from posting any sexually explicit
data/027503.wav|lot of terms like poison pill and yadda yadda
data/001710.wav|it has to be noted that the vast majority of the memes around grandpa joe are solely about the version of the character
data/020889.wav|what was it again it was so stupid nvidia and video graphics trading cards you said what
data/020339.wav|a miracle so this customer walks in red suit jolly
data/020521.wav|that makes them one of the most valuable
data/027227.wav|were confusing and more importantly is it scratches
data/003017.wav|and so we have no idea what's going on literally no idea what's going on
data/010391.wav|he gets off on it it gets off on it he gets off on it he
data/005833.wav|no one else at the table
data/000143.wav|you should put three wedding invites on ebay starting at
data/030257.wav|there's like nothing in it like so i'm like going under the
data/014669.wav|no reason i don't understand why
data/024472.wav|pick up on what's going on in the first few seconds okay and we've already coded this ad in our brain as
data/024592.wav|just a banana man he is fully capable of
data/019616.wav|which by the way we have a special
data/031033.wav|and the second the literal second
data/006311.wav|if the a little uh tft gambling with
data/030993.wav|it's kind of way not in
data/021426.wav|euro commission the reason rebelwood got
data/020167.wav|wave this is crazy dude if gucci tweeted
data/021844.wav|what i'm thinking okay so he's kind of terrible at titling
data/012636.wav|or which means he will schedule
data/030051.wav|we've been hoisted by your own petard because
data/032221.wav|but then we have this idea sort of enters our brains wait a minute the field was due two hands ago
data/013952.wav|because if you use one of these things
data/021453.wav|walker works at all okay the price is only comparable to the to its own stock
data/029134.wav|let me tell you something murder will out okay you commit a crime i will solve that cold case years later and i will
data/011596.wav|it's my brain just doesn't want to agree
data/027802.wav|the way that we got out of it was
data/031182.wav|or something that there was a lot of doubt like oh
data/026538.wav|was easier to scam people now i i
data/028966.wav|if the feed myself and i can't
data/021026.wav|i mean i think that's got broad appeal the highest honor it's
data/002926.wav|it was perfect background noise tv but it's not it's just not
data/027047.wav|i have no strong take on it i wish this ad was better because i would like to be
data/008978.wav|i wanted to have all the people that were there when i bought it it's not a strong argument i'm just saying it's the
data/028443.wav|so you just gotta sit in my office and chill and i was like no
data/024877.wav|we all said it was worthless or worth like two
data/028011.wav|we really have to hope that the war continues as long as it can because we're getting a lot of great
data/023508.wav|italian foreign limited vehicles and it shows in the
data/008642.wav|it it's one of the few advantages america has actually
data/002111.wav|can happen and the companies are scared of
data/010906.wav|if you type exclamation point minions a certain number of times
data/004963.wav|theme of what i'm talking about today is that the last three months have been absolutely awful for elon musk just a real collective
data/019970.wav|turn it into pixar while he was fired from apple and he in that time founded pixar
data/029674.wav|it's like don't do that don't have that quote
data/017709.wav|significantly higher for apple among their over over their tech competitors
data/023814.wav|it's for weeks john get up
data/028070.wav|they were not getting it and that's within 20 years it
data/020592.wav|awards in the history of mankind the monday awards officially called the
data/010649.wav|thirty minutes but i can't curse all day today it's a no cursing day and that's the end of that stand of the story
data/013117.wav|the sigma tweets instagram account that posted pictures of tweets over pictures of
data/005603.wav|what about the miz history oh
data/028643.wav|i don't leave the office i literally live at the office for the next
data/017835.wav|it's time to hang out and chill and do some
data/031377.wav|bougie and if that were it i would say okay he's making money but you know
data/014138.wav|that they won that people can't leave people can't leave and take their audience with them so twitch started to
data/007520.wav|large coffee cup filled with sour candy and it was a surreal experience it was surreal it was a surreal experience i've never had that happen ever
data/012165.wav|or stuff so i got some of that and i got to be able to enter into a
data/031462.wav|it's point by the way i was toasty the the sun and the alcohol
data/014575.wav|stream i'll go to youtube and just do youtube
data/016545.wav|increasing in scope and so there's potential and opportunity where another
data/021547.wav|i don't need elon musk to be like yeah
data/005011.wav|we will see it remains to be seen
data/009394.wav|i have a career absolutely doublelift's the
data/008942.wav|as an excuse to sell tesla shares i think that gives too much credit because it doesn't make sense to sign the deal at that point you can talk about the deal and then sell the shares like you're
data/005704.wav|with second in command mad or so and so we we we want that anyway but we actually got to with second in command man and so
data/019027.wav|it really wary because the tech isn't quite there and we're still all a little creeped out about it but we're less creeped out
data/030071.wav|but i was like mom and dad do not get me a gift in april i want nothing for my birthday what i
data/030185.wav|and it's probably even split whatever
data/023295.wav|celebrity and creators which has only gotten more powerful every year i believe it was kylie jenner who
data/022271.wav|you obviously only wanted to spend
data/008528.wav|fuck now only if you think if you are the person out there who is certain if you're the judge if you're the delaware court judge and
data/023113.wav|of the milk and then went to bed all right people didn't give a
data/027512.wav|due to the previous ceo jack being a part-time ceo
data/019081.wav|it was just using technology social media and
data/013198.wav|these tweets you're going to laugh until you
data/010908.wav|and there are a number of those and we don't really need to do
data/032022.wav|is an etsy rewards card give it up for
data/013772.wav|i need to read that news thank god blizzard's in
data/008581.wav|it's not that nice of a car it's okay it gets the job eight point
data/002391.wav|at the second it comes out so that we are legitimately unspoiled and we can come
data/001771.wav|and to for our future generations
data/023557.wav|in fact that amazon is the biggest shopping service in the world to bundle it with prime to make prime video
data/019933.wav|amazon bought twitch for a billion dollars okay now that was in
data/016020.wav|worth mentioning youtube if i do a follow-up
data/031639.wav|out with a top korean player
data/024800.wav|to take a photo and share your friends that you got something cool which makes you think
data/026919.wav|tour of zeus zeus he didn't cheat on hera
data/032425.wav|you seem like someone who has placed too much of
data/004002.wav|i will see you tomorrow if you want
data/023371.wav|the wrong and so a day later i tagged him in my first post i think in
data/003250.wav|and how that would affect the reading experience
data/010930.wav|and they will send you some kind of minions pizza kit let me see if i have a video of it and if you create that pizza and take a photo of it you have a chance to win
data/003858.wav|my no matter what it wasn't
data/026350.wav|and it's noticeable right it is a noticeable difference now microsoft in
data/013324.wav|even though i am really strong
data/019558.wav|jingle i might have to follow through oh
data/027942.wav|this model that requires them to sell information on your trades to hedge
data/005001.wav|if we're gonna say the bots were too high
data/011089.wav|thanks dude i forgot his name now
data/008610.wav|if the for kicking the tires is now over so he's offered
data/018963.wav|for some fundamentally stupid reason made the
data/021719.wav|if i was picking a spokeswoman i wouldn't go to amy schumer i feel like you could get somebody from and you would get less hate on social media than if you got amy schumer
data/027953.wav|is directing job of fast tin because of a
data/014176.wav|if i didn't know them i would guess and that
data/009738.wav|if they want my my nimble and dexterous palms
data/032155.wav|if you guys don't play crafts i'd like to give
data/011822.wav|like the six or seven maybe eight eight or yeah probably about eight eight
data/009887.wav|would it be destroyed by climate change and so but what that means is billionaires
data/027303.wav|and philosophy is that challenging provides reward the fact that you overcame the challenge makes it that much more rewarding when you do and i think
data/026224.wav|thing but technically you can pay later but if you were to miss
data/025192.wav|clever and like get people on their side
data/021365.wav|explain what a short is really simply
data/008536.wav|we'd already signed the deal and they
data/017533.wav|part of people's daily uh content diet people
data/002955.wav|and you know what i'm saying it feels like it's fine and people are
data/012901.wav|that was the best i mean that changed everything
data/016887.wav|but he got double his viewership because
data/018375.wav|me good job only fans dude
data/023580.wav|at each movie that the weekend that that that the
data/025619.wav|but i will say it is now back as of yesterday afternoon check it out we're in the
data/017971.wav|quality of life improvement it was the whole thing's a little embarrassing
data/014610.wav|the stream this many hours and run this many ads youtube is less strict on that which means if you're someone like
data/020884.wav|and i should just quit this job and start my own business theoretically you could but
data/022774.wav|i don't even ask for one
data/020861.wav|i know this because i've hired people and i've looked at resumes and just having the degree is often a way to get your resume through the first fit like do you know what i'm saying the power is
data/010937.wav|think i have a video for you that can really show you the cheese blaster technology this is
data/013094.wav|thank you jackie moon these shops noah rose
data/021592.wav|it's like hold diamond hands diamond is the hardest material hold
data/025355.wav|his office and they were sitting there like they owned the place i'm walking in i
data/026105.wav|it's a corporation resonated quite far and
data/014397.wav|needs to be cracked by youtube it's the
data/011461.wav|the the goat he's been so good at rapping for so
data/012142.wav|at the airlock or something i
data/014175.wav|i went for ludwig and let me tell you i can't speak to contract numbers i know them which
data/004720.wav|check out the new mango combo video you are in it i have not played melee with
data/016456.wav|you to participation people are generally getting paid more wages are going up i'm not sure applebee's will thrive in this environment but the fact that he sees inflation and rising gas prices
data/001698.wav|after a viral rant by sports commentator jim rome on the character in
data/010534.wav|fall guys twitch rivals i am a captain
data/008310.wav|so we'll do that and then
data/016684.wav|i an interesting stat but it is uh in
data/020529.wav|this game buggy like ea would cyberpunk will be will be fixed i
data/023992.wav|these money to grow you go to these big outside investors hedge funds rich people and you get millions of dollars and they get a cut of your company outside investors in general some of them were scared off by only fans being adult content focused later that day after that report comes out the company out of the blue sort of abruptly announces that it's going to prohibit users from
data/019273.wav|but then they fired back with this the Xbox flop of the
data/006855.wav|i go to a gym so no i wouldn't do that that would feel incredibly embarrassing to set up a camera and like what's up coffee calves
data/030312.wav|the show up to his wedding dressed head
data/022171.wav|english subtitles but it has 9 million views so i
data/011839.wav|the to you um they're all in character and the
data/004343.wav|dude i saw something today why was i thinking about quincy today i i swear oh
data/012023.wav|it's like it's so pandering it's so pandering dude doesn't make any
data/026632.wav|if they wanted to buy something else and i also
data/020864.wav|probably doesn't even bother you at all but if you've been on tech twitter there
data/029445.wav|because once he commits he's the boss we'll get it over with and then
data/000391.wav|and so because he lives in vegas and we know
data/015118.wav|that are going to eat our lunch it was a very genius very very genius thought and it led to them creating their first original series house of cards now
data/030880.wav|like three days and i'm spiraling because of it i feel like you are either like thriving or spiraling you're either like having yeah you're you're you're

data/025872.wav|just like being nice if toast has been given a lot of money and been treated really well he's
data/006268.wav|it's prospects please t y is that your
data/011785.wav|and then they load us into
data/005567.wav|my understanding is that hassan stayed back after everyone else left and
data/029874.wav|he was that guy for music
data/018545.wav|are losing money on it so between those two things microsoft
data/032107.wav|in the past 15 seconds he just threw it
data/006104.wav|i think you guys do need the
data/019855.wav|can we find out who is left let's start with number five of course this one's a doozy okay
data/009737.wav|the problem is his fingers are too big
data/024441.wav|see this you kind of can't look away if you're at the right angle i feel like
data/022054.wav|who's not guilty about eating all the tasty treats they want
data/003935.wav|he took a big chunk of votes it was the biggest a
data/008713.wav|was dramatically higher like over half of all things
data/008974.wav|it'd be a red car when i bought a blue car and since he bought the company they froze hiring changed nothing except they fired
data/014197.wav|but gaming is not bigger than youtube gaming live facebook numbers are generally

data/031441.wav|he goes farther so the farther you go down this beach
data/013337.wav|it was a marketing monday example that involved a lot of oreos of different flavors and sizes and so i
data/003616.wav|that type i think that's really cool i didn't with my dad back at the time i was
data/003741.wav|why politicians before but like let's say
data/016634.wav|at present an opportunity in that and that is the cost of solar for example has dropped by a factor of
data/005220.wav|do that but it was it wasn't uh it didn't it didn't reach
data/012519.wav|that's my guess but for now at this price i'd probably say i'd probably say save your money unless you're a huge star wars fan or you're a huge theater
data/005404.wav|the discord and then copy paste and then
data/000136.wav|and then at that point when i was showing off a nice jersey you thought it was a good time to call
data/022444.wav|the android ones green has caused people to not switch it's crazy and it seems small but it's been so effective and it's like these tiny details matter to how the people that use your products see
data/021434.wav|well as their boss and so they shut down trading which is i mean that's blatant market manipulation they stopped you from being able to buy they only allowed you to sell
data/017395.wav|am show with me and so it was big and if you know there
data/026455.wav|i keep rewards your faith often with high impact high value sets it's one of the reasons i believe
data/004812.wav|very good pr moment for mr musk again this news along would be constitute a bad couple of weeks you know this is not a great thing to have happen but unfortunately a lot more has been happening to mr must now i mentioned that very good pr moment for mr musk again this news alone would be constitute a bad couple of weeks you know this is not a great thing to have happen but unfortunately
data/021639.wav|i think this brought it home literally i think they know what they're doing this is a solid if not great ad did you know that norway
data/028094.wav|he himself was that beijing thank you for the
data/009607.wav|or should lose you gold if you kill them
data/024914.wav|is like i rolled i didn't get it now i'm more likely and
data/011369.wav|interesting story to tell one that i'm a little bit embarrassed actually to fully reveal to you guys but i will be doing that uh don't say
data/024411.wav|well dialogue cutscenes where my character expresses enthusiasm for the products of
data/025518.wav|there are getting sold instantly uh so
data/017027.wav|about marketing with a girl now we're going on a second date no thinking about dumping her after two
data/030171.wav|isn't bad losers we just and there's only one outcome in both of our minds usually is that we win and so when we lose we just try to change things to make that happen anyway either way we've been competitive forever so we were competitive at
data/021236.wav|and this one i'm really excited about
data/016220.wav|did you already do the guessing
data/008131.wav|the job is that i don't punt away all the money i make working all day
data/030666.wav|i i literally have no idea how to pronounce it so they go to him
data/025356.wav|i work here and they were like sitting
data/029830.wav|and like i knew him to be cool and so like don't the
data/011687.wav|in trip one thing i tell myself over and over on
data/020917.wav|in heartbreak imo if you're passionate about it so
data/029983.wav|was like a natty number one you just
data/002299.wav|i like twitch is not 10 years old dude
data/020768.wav|each one means a lot to me i definitely don't do it for the money i do it because i love the brands love
data/023753.wav|or more on car insurance 44
data/028806.wav|if the first response is like oh oh oh don't worry don't
data/029000.wav|oh no no he's scrappy dude if there was
data/004699.wav|i hope it helps i am not sure the cdc
data/002855.wav|if the for businesses so businesses actually get
data/028851.wav|pile on the bed and i just snooze on
data/006412.wav|and this one this also ties into crypto startups
data/013756.wav|the the most dominant companies in gaming ever
data/013913.wav|willing to talk about i like to end the
data/005271.wav|you like i heard him in ludwig's stream once
data/032262.wav|we would have been fine but
data/029842.wav|his favorite way to wind down
data/017649.wav|and this has led to a
data/022411.wav|scene where they recognize how important where you're watching it is to the ad experience and so they built an ad entirely about
data/026010.wav|winnie the pooh has now entered the
data/003129.wav|i bought it for like 52 billion
data/012151.wav|been conspiring with the first order how
data/027770.wav|predict you guess you check you get better that's why when two days ago
data/020685.wav|never heard of them came out of nowhere to win the world's hearts with this game in fact we ran the numbers this game had only a mere nine million pre-orders only 9 million pre-orders
data/025286.wav|so at this point i feel like i'm not doing my due diligence as a marketer if i don't
data/019127.wav|larger than life but you're not
data/026819.wav|in our lunch because the very people they want to attract which are again high revenue and the young are going to
data/004976.wav|he also keeps amidst all of this continually pumping
data/031668.wav|and like the crowd could get loud
data/020431.wav|i think we landed on a zero or a cringe for this one there is a single soda ad that
data/007111.wav|and i clicked on one middle of the road
data/000579.wav|supposed to be like a really bad physical prop combat comedian
data/000367.wav|because we're waiting for these uh food
data/017433.wav|i have really shiny hair and shiny hair looks great on instagram that's a that's a response okay and then
data/028846.wav|so it was like it was like
data/019774.wav|watch dogs now the reason it's number
data/029452.wav|and he brings out cube world
data/026444.wav|it's created key cultural moments around his emo now i think for example at the end
data/022389.wav|what happens is over time you do enough
data/000244.wav|we're all making money friday night we're killing it
data/001934.wav|i think i could do either one of them
data/016808.wav|as north and south america combined and again that's a very small part of the global population which will be you know vast majority in
data/006255.wav|all day stream tomorrow let's go no not all day tomorrow but friday saturday sunday is the
data/019566.wav|with an f for so long and then suddenly they
data/029507.wav|i could have been a lot of people i was saying you know some of my
data/022176.wav|well we started off with a bang let's
data/026411.wav|it the better dealerships car dealerships in general are a bad experience tesla
data/004323.wav|elon musk obama lebron james or steve carell
data/001674.wav|funny an entirely new audience and they have a more youthful audience and
data/003313.wav|press release redefining recession right before thursday's
data/012526.wav|fucking to inexpensive and so if if uh it
data/027196.wav|in the description below basically what public
data/016735.wav|you know i've had a few iterations of that beyond over the years and
data/021405.wav|in the short that means you have sold stock that you
data/011869.wav|but it talks to you and the thing is it's like part of a story so what i finally what i realize it's like a
data/008155.wav|think i will no it's not dj wheat although you know
data/002534.wav|and you can be kicked out for the next person heads or tails luna and you could be kicked out for the next person
data/028384.wav|well saying let's circle back on this
data/026615.wav|acquisitions this is oculus for about
data/021353.wav|am not because i'm actually quite pissed off and in fact i'm pretty sure this stock would have still zoomed today
data/032138.wav|well this summer cancel the events
data/007837.wav|please i you shouldn't drop a joke like that
data/008802.wav|when i looked into it and it's like the banks cannot withdraw at whim they they have agreed to give the money if the deal goes through
data/017189.wav|with the my body i couldn't get a full breath
data/028575.wav|you just made me money and i'm not freaking out from the
data/000313.wav|it'll blow it and saturday comes in and from
data/004127.wav|it's there's always one person that might don't be that person
data/004507.wav|it's such an honor and a pleasure to have you in my chat and for you to be another year older it really means a lot to all of us not just me but everyone in chat so just thanks again and
data/005350.wav|when he sits down he turns around looks back
data/013939.wav|wait fees they don't want to
data/029577.wav|being able to simplify it down to like these cool different styles is a
data/008667.wav|very interesting i am getting these removed but i i have to find a nail salon to do it apparently
data/012291.wav|so i'm playing my ass off
data/025827.wav|in the effect because i'll show you this graph
data/017128.wav|army crawled through the desert for 12 months with no
data/006499.wav|in the very short term it's a win because i got to watch klarna and
data/003310.wav|it look at the data including labor market consumer
data/028586.wav|and i got quite high i got let me show you let me show you where i got it will shock and all you
data/014522.wav|real knowledge okay sometimes i um i'll talk your ear off okay with my
data/000032.wav|you're canadian audience and called it a stag party is that what you
data/024031.wav|that was their plan the problem is that the banks aren't the only ones that saw this message okay they thought that maybe creators wouldn't care or they wouldn't
data/000070.wav|that's that's fine we'll take that
data/005854.wav|absolutely and before we even get down to the bracket breakdown how much are we trying to raise for the extra
data/017672.wav|well designed the ipod this is
data/030704.wav|and only one river flowing out of it that's what i knew about lake baikal so let's finish
data/014340.wav|im us i want to use that same paradigm here twitch needs to become youtube faster than youtube
data/005162.wav|let's see this is not a
data/013789.wav|have you ever been in a multiplayer game
data/006573.wav|where it made an average of
data/026563.wav|it sticks to his guns and doesn't sell and just
data/021861.wav|like for example even it's something as simple as as your
data/008406.wav|is that you probably don't want to hear you
data/003847.wav|the rock is the wrong person
data/013519.wav|my boy is new to linkedin and this is what he's posting
data/007141.wav|every single cough the whole flight i'm hearing like
data/015925.wav|in use of ai to determine what you might want to
data/000364.wav|fucking squad but we're losing the 5v5
data/022522.wav|the the mark of a good april
data/000348.wav|we were at a barcade for
data/026926.wav|was that you know bmw's got an
data/001304.wav|youtube in a minute did they just get boring or
data/003898.wav|so it's like imagine if either one of them doesn't really matter
data/021875.wav|very soon the trick is to be very ominous and robotic that's how you spit game like
data/010590.wav|as being torn asunder torn apart root and stem okay every the economy is in shambles things are in disaster right now and
data/000483.wav|and all i can think about
data/022250.wav|this one's called my dad is a liar daddy is the sweetest daddy in the world
data/029473.wav|hey here's an email of somebody you should look up that the
data/026413.wav|or by your purchase after the fact um it's
data/014066.wav|at full force on making some stuff that's going to make youtube gaming a lot better in a way their own engineers have struggled to so those two things make this pickup particularly interesting but i want to
data/011254.wav|was like cameras all over the house it was the worst day
data/026192.wav|i am giving a failed arcane because i'm going to have to explain to an angry audience in a few years why i don't understand or like
data/021376.wav|but i guarantee i'll give them back to you in a month
data/028474.wav|this kid should have just said sir yes sir but he's like no dude
data/027273.wav|i think brands like ubisoft may not
data/000089.wav|worry a lot a lot but it's my wedding you know
data/001831.wav|if people were getting paid like absurd amounts of money and the turnover there is like incredibly high because it's it's dangerous and scary and also like the demands are crazy they change all the time like you'll have an idea
data/010147.wav|hey whenever you're ready pretty soon
data/031126.wav|when he first started growing i was like bro someone like a lyric by the way
data/017596.wav|to stand out from your competitors
data/012094.wav|i guy would look at me
data/002848.wav|hundred million dollars something like that but she has done it so
data/014921.wav|top 500 and by the way
data/000550.wav|it literally because i remembered this
data/014532.wav|it's deep knowledge of streaming on twitch he said leagues viewers
data/004511.wav|right now happy birthday okay that should i should wrap things up
data/012939.wav|big companies by doing them well because you can get infinite return like
data/020897.wav|i was saying we're 10 years away from vr being
data/031227.wav|we get farther in the tournament
data/001866.wav|i already know the line will be like
data/000377.wav|i mean i get i you know i make some bets
data/025409.wav|go through this as i see it i'm going
data/026564.wav|game for the love of it then i'm really
data/025260.wav|you know listen i don't hate every one of these casting choices i think chris
data/024397.wav|probably find a different concept if the concept for your ad requires you to
data/012909.wav|and they were offering about the same salary but the the my boss who
data/020850.wav|my career and i see even more of it
data/023320.wav|i swear to god you're being scammed bro
data/013944.wav|i'll pay later so you understand my dilemma here there is no advantage there is no advantage these things are literally scams okay they are literally just debt rebranded okay and so
data/021688.wav|good choice oh my god can you believe it holy moly rocket mortgage came through big the only ad this one was quite
data/008464.wav|if the for another month no need to
data/029998.wav|we had every single coomer on twitch okay
data/002495.wav|what if you set up a war between
data/015855.wav|well as these other guys as as amazon and disney but as like fortnite
data/001595.wav|meals thank you again to factor meals code pog a truck
data/021537.wav|what we don't talk about is that there's there's other smaller hedge funds that are also jumping on board this money train to try and squeeze the big guys out of shorts and they're putting in millions is it possible those hedge funds losing all their money crashes the market because
data/024482.wav|i have that hard literally show a picture of a
data/031312.wav|the crime as i would soon find out i'm walking out the store
data/018924.wav|who were promising investors that if you
data/009940.wav|for people to laugh at it i also think that the internet bullying it is actually going to be good for
data/027617.wav|not to attract and retain new talent and make actual changes to the to the program and so we'll see how that undergoes jeff bezos came in with a take if you get jeff bezos out of his slumbering post amazon rocket ship retirement to tweet about it then then you know something's big and
data/013224.wav|if the miffy thunder thank you
data/026724.wav|a little bit of what my my my two minds are on this number one the good parts of this is that it's good for blizzard okay the leadership of blizzard is terrible they
data/015494.wav|war employees they have cruise ships they have theme parks they have merch they have better
data/025436.wav|we are one coke away from
data/020016.wav|later where'd the hair come from elon the
data/018797.wav|i hundred times it's a little bit we look
data/011100.wav|not that you've ever had a real friend but like imagine you did okay
data/016766.wav|that was like we're basically at like a zero net
data/010309.wav|i have to save a slot in case
data/017275.wav|if you keep that in mind you should be able to draw plenty of nude winnie the pooh's but if you draw the the standard iconic red shirt poo you can be sued by disney still disney
data/008173.wav|so there was no it was all like going to tournaments you had to like get your team and go to tournaments
data/013825.wav|is argue about games on forums and it was
data/019086.wav|if the for me has been like when they're very
data/018561.wav|both sides are releasing everything on
data/031133.wav|if you see something working there's really nothing wrong with
data/008896.wav|you know conservative elon musk let's go kind of side of it i think they think of twitter as like in their mind it's like a woman with pink hair and a blue
data/016296.wav|i really didn't know what to make
data/023468.wav|it's more than it costs to make
data/024903.wav|do things like um they will make you feel
data/004860.wav|yeah there's a lot happening but uh
data/007542.wav|it was awful awful awful it looked bad
data/030810.wav|there was a little game for kids like a fish game where you
data/028588.wav|this is the way back machine to the season two ladder back before they had
data/016280.wav|there will be no crunch and you know what if i think of anyone in
data/010700.wav|i say i didn't say that i didn't say a word no i
data/011068.wav|he can or can't hear you and can't you can't hear
data/031637.wav|and then he had fun he had fun for the
data/025935.wav|the game and in fact are trying to pivot
data/010689.wav|you don't need to read too
data/026177.wav|obscure it all together nobody made this game here's the new call of duty vanguard we don't know where it came from we don't know who made it
data/025124.wav|if the topic on marketing monday before that we have to get to our wins and fails this ad is a fail
data/023965.wav|it's like second and i think it's been the big
data/023840.wav|the and i want to give him a huge congratulations congrats to king delroy on a new member
data/010672.wav|one of the call maybe who dat or
data/017909.wav|actually i have more to say
data/003986.wav|not nearly bald enough boy guy party in the
data/019889.wav|it because it was a fun game in spite of peter molyneux promising and lying about it so hard
data/019624.wav|what part of the schedule sort of popped up the auto zone jingle welcome
data/001405.wav|hello i like your profile picture
data/025239.wav|with because i guess people that
data/021344.wav|and you enjoyed it perhaps consider
data/015633.wav|same as peacock but probably worse but they have one key difference they have one thing that makes them able to weather any storm and that my
data/013941.wav|plenty of those the payments you make are far
data/019831.wav|was to dig deep shut up and work on their game and so for that i can't i think it would be boring for this list to put him at the top that's
data/004543.wav|like i was like hey mark
data/006646.wav|i didn't is it good for today though i
data/012436.wav|and okay let me get to the end
data/022442.wav|it's like probably made them billions of dollars this is literally a wall street journal article about how it makes switching
data/012454.wav|and he told me well he's like the empire
data/004898.wav|what is your intentions here and he wouldn't say he was being kind of coy
data/017318.wav|if they're about to go to war there is nothing similar to what it is it's like a draft yeah
data/032033.wav|imitating scar it's kind of like the end of a human centipede started streaming what am i doing all this job talk is so rude of me i
data/018881.wav|we stressed about the kids worried about school I don't want to get a zero on a
data/018604.wav|now will elder scrolls six ever show up
data/012167.wav|it's space poker and like they're having a space poker tournament
data/011398.wav|but i did spend over five thousand dollars in two days so we have to talk about that and i
data/001965.wav|yeah i did i think about that all
data/029612.wav|they didn't even care zayn's beyond that zayn
data/007806.wav|if the the go and there's absolutely no reason i would need to
data/029527.wav|okay you hate him he hates
data/020958.wav|fucking wrong you're an idiot but if they go you got a point this is and then i go well actually you know
data/012968.wav|academia you bastards bro i respect you so much i was
data/002253.wav|to surprise and delight me and i'm glad that your dad enjoyed some parts of it
data/009629.wav|at tournaments back when i would go to tournaments
data/014359.wav|it was not a gamer they use ig live
data/025831.wav|only going to experience this on crack after
data/021510.wav|the only person who's putting the money in
data/020146.wav|it's just like a medium joke it's like it's like
data/024616.wav|but later that might be in in calling
data/027793.wav|to start crashing at once and so like i said i
data/014553.wav|nothing it's not on my mind first of all because i'm not a full-time
data/019500.wav|in your brain you gotta see it around seven times seven plus times really if
data/023930.wav|like move his lips or something to make it look like he's happy or
data/012672.wav|at at the be honest um
data/000316.wav|everybody's winning um everybody's making money we're having
data/017657.wav|had a ritual of unpacking to make the product feel special packaging can be theater
data/011561.wav|is that there's not enough marvel movie jokes in it
data/012986.wav|it's like designed to be as boring and monotonous as possible the way people learn in real life is they pick one thing they get into and they get obsessed with it it should be like like like you should have a history month if you're gonna do it like that way it should be
data/025155.wav|it's okay wait wait wait you can't see this
data/015922.wav|if you have shows everyone's talking about that demand your attention regularly you can raise prices the second
data/009072.wav|hold up hold up hold up hold up hello
data/016817.wav|if the thing over the past 15 to 20
data/024086.wav|they were one of the quickest adopters of uh food
data/010125.wav|i'm just giving him a ring
data/011771.wav|a joke and then she points out somebody and
data/000311.wav|we all agree okay we all shake
data/022943.wav|the careful because if they did actually
data/008424.wav|i was doing homework but this is far
data/023047.wav|some things which allowed for google and firefox
data/011610.wav|thank you very much uh so if
data/029913.wav|just had one more story about
data/001571.wav|death valley is the hottest place in the world
data/012333.wav|we're going to need to pick them up with your goliat
data/005819.wav|why you'd be like i thought you didn't care about this stuff and he's like
data/008926.wav|it'd be tough for me to remember this
data/031516.wav|first team to three points wins okay the first four matches are pre-planned so you know who
data/022067.wav|or to tell unless you check the little tiny
data/012241.wav|so jenny draws two cards flips them over
data/011107.wav|if you'd think it should be like you're like the
data/030826.wav|but a person who did as much cocaine as you seem to imagine that i do every single time i'm not on camera would be dead would be long dead because i'm a
data/011458.wav|that is the bar that most actually not this
data/013661.wav|i am change that don't worry about that don't worry about that i will update
data/004965.wav|has legally changed her name to confirm
data/027753.wav|version of the headset and then take all their market share anyway let me give you a fail this is going to be the
data/010982.wav|of course is coming to theaters and you can get free tickets for by participating or signing up for hellofresh but
data/028771.wav|told me years later that she remembers that call because how

data/011878.wav|thought to explore the ship and the ship's pretty cool i go look there's i mean again this
data/014319.wav|it doesn't caught up to it is crazy again one thing
data/002977.wav|and i thought it was the most brilliant stunt of all time i thought it was like
data/031531.wav|feel like because half the game is micro like
data/004923.wav|as itself in anticipation of being taken over and
data/015529.wav|that makes them a lot of money okay if you're in the apple
data/003786.wav|yeah that's their strategy so of course
data/027577.wav|other people that are interested in acquiring has been looking very closely at twitter's financials to see how much
data/014398.wav|probably one of the toughest these two are easier to copy this is very tough for them to crack they have to get the right people and really work at it and then finally
data/027945.wav|if you want to buy like 0.01
data/023841.wav|member of the family i sent him an email
data/026856.wav|i saw a lot of uh i'll buy whatever the
data/024574.wav|but you might be thinking why did epic really i mean listen they got they got a little
data/024157.wav|i still didn't make a giant contract from mixer that only had to do half a year for ninja still remains undefeated as the ultimate bag in all of esports
data/030230.wav|if the phone that's yeah i remember this because i
data/020071.wav|our lives instagram instagram was purchased forget this a single one billion dollars one billion to between
data/019428.wav|but it can't be any two it's not
data/005437.wav|so here's the only thing is i took a photo again this is not i don't foresee this being a common thing for me in the grand scheme of my life so far be it for me if
data/003569.wav|i i i don't think i'm a dumb optimist but i think
data/029743.wav|would it be the perfect world for me
data/021230.wav|every brand is gonna get ticked out yeah
data/005622.wav|as an entertainer completely dead forever
data/017367.wav|for toddlers is actually really important because alexa will try to test them and kill them if they're not ready first thing you
data/008431.wav|if i can get someone to do it actually it's probably a funny idea
data/012903.wav|so when i decided to leave twitch i had an offer from blizzard and an offer from
data/021250.wav|three times retail while the xbox is
data/003381.wav|that caused the robot to grab his index finger and squeeze it several bystanders helped free the boy and take him away from the table
data/008475.wav|no i wouldn't i think they're amazing no
data/021475.wav|i mean tomorrow's the day so
data/026916.wav|i figure you could use a little
data/003070.wav|i got a problem for you guys
data/021303.wav|if you have a giant youtube channel or a giant instagram basically anything but a twitter twitter doesn't monetize so sorry
data/029763.wav|to air i'm so glad i got to see
data/013415.wav|father when can i leave to be
data/001751.wav|very very and i i read that when i was
data/021320.wav|okay because creators played it that is huge amounts of money in their pocket and people are noticing that game developers are realizing that streamers can make or break your game my prediction is that streamers
data/000014.wav|that's crazy there's no way dude no i don't have
data/012041.wav|a hologram of yoda a pretty good
data/030674.wav|at my dad's happy my dad's in the you
data/014599.wav|from they would never do a like a broadcaster
data/030148.wav|my apartment here in san jose so ludwig
data/025204.wav|in this past week oh so this is sort of relevant to
data/000124.wav|it is that dude you can hear me having lost my
data/022790.wav|and that's a lot of money of course but if they had just lost that it would be like ah whatever
data/020374.wav|pretty solid one yeah this is a bad
data/004817.wav|he also apparently secretly had sex and
data/009923.wav|flick the it's like it's like
data/024911.wav|i have some pity rules in some
data/028765.wav|is a recruiter the way she said it and i'm older and wiser now was
data/004912.wav|it's an amazing deal twitter's not
data/007635.wav|at the seven hour elden ring video too
data/010550.wav|way league because it's the only way for me
data/024862.wav|if you play with your friends a lot for fun you are most likely to buy that new valerie gun skin but what's surprising in my research is that this is not where the money comes from they make money off this to be sure but it turns out that people just buying skins directly is only a small part of the truly large gotcha game economy next up is explorers to make them happy you have to
data/022877.wav|all participants for more than 20 minutes so an actual court case
data/025094.wav|like this is a baby game now
data/000290.wav|but we're not putting 50 racks each
data/002171.wav|yeah always have a tight five ready it shows strength of character
data/027484.wav|years the photo i have to really sum it all up
data/023756.wav|a retired football player that probably would do it for
data/023571.wav|it's a great way to think about marketing in general and i hope that this breakdown
data/023733.wav|with these number three it's worth mentioning i already have them now so
data/017542.wav|i the corporation there is no company that has out valued apple at three
data/012545.wav|ips would be good to do this with like i
data/029513.wav|tell it like if they just told these little side stories of people who wanted to be even one god and they struggled and it
data/004346.wav|thanks you you're interested in i don't subscribe to the bloons
data/016783.wav|is the largest age court in america right now and uh by
data/030522.wav|i think she's their daughter and i'm the guy that got lumped in her
data/008185.wav|i think if you like to cook they'd fire but straight up i'm sticking with factor because factor i
data/016907.wav|and that leads you to me
data/026392.wav|your lesson and made sure that every
data/025182.wav|be thinking about knees while i'm eating my
data/001046.wav|you should be looking your text
data/027235.wav|i don't care about pc graphics stability and performance apparently nor quest design really and you know coming from users
data/025340.wav|i hosted uh the twitch weekly show at the
data/006151.wav|i did play a little bit of fall guys off
data/017791.wav|you know emote cultural moments i don't

data/013778.wav|and have just begun to shred
data/005413.wav|quack you are not literally you think the net what do you think the net is on money
data/015930.wav|queen's gambit and you're scrolling past peaky blinders it will show you a thumbnail that has anya
data/008119.wav|well that's big of him for black history
data/002795.wav|it's casey it's very funny is your mic loose yeah it's

data/007838.wav|nice shirt did you steal it from a farmer nice attitude
data/028905.wav|very very very long flight of stairs to where the bathroom was and so when you're that drunk a huge flight of stairs is very intimidating and apparently i dragged my roommate diego and i was like diego i need help i need help to get to this bathroom okay so he the way he tells the story is that he spent 20 minutes
data/023352.wav|it really likes crossplay now honest

data/009949.wav|these are good and bully more

data/026980.wav|safe and easy way to get into
data/014705.wav|to be like a black like black tie you know i don't want any of you wearing like hoodies or something

data/018273.wav|in coffee what are you just
data/015979.wav|who's money you lose money to grow grow grow grow grow grow and then once you have a monopoly once you're big enough that you
data/002738.wav|take it take the deal a hundred and fifty
data/002082.wav|i know your hands and you show it to them
data/006702.wav|though is that i cursed like a sailor i actually cursed like a sailor upon
data/008548.wav|i to use he's not really losing so
data/017219.wav|is really get some chills and
data/007593.wav|we did connect we talked about it
data/003534.wav|it but now's the best day
data/020609.wav|i was all live the man does not
data/000805.wav|it's like i cannot lose i've already won so much the odds
data/031708.wav|there's no way i need to care about
data/011975.wav|the a bad guy and i start getting all the bad
data/018583.wav|in marketing blitz they have great titles disney plus is doing well it has not
data/018535.wav|in the netflix of gaming prints dollar bills and you need games
data/019754.wav|week for this topic i think we all know why cyberpunk
data/019913.wav|in the most famous gaming ads of all time it's
data/021515.wav|lose their own personal money they have lost all the other rituals money who they
data/015082.wav|a big part of the business netflix actually made more money even when streaming was like this era they made more money from dvd rentals
data/004881.wav|employees to do it so again i'm not
data/028945.wav|or somewhere with a really different culture to your own you will get homesick i swear to god i was having a good time in korea i like korea i love again i came there because i also love starcraft
data/025242.wav|the west banned kids from playing games the
data/018802.wav|warranted but uh you guys have reviewed
data/011739.wav|and then underneath it it'll say their home planet and i think they allowed them to choose
data/013253.wav|sexy without connor's approval you have to
data/008940.wav|it's i've heard that argument and and people
data/006721.wav|this guy's a non-stop tweeter the veil
data/022295.wav|shows up with a legal team and
data/021381.wav|it doesn't know the difference it's the same stock but i there's that difference
data/016950.wav|people hopefully you can follow nancy pelosi
data/011138.wav|i have no idea what's happening
data/003620.wav|we don't have a good relationship
data/032063.wav|not to the producers nobody knows what he's
data/022246.wav|see we got here another thai commercial i
data/019539.wav|they defeat all of canada's marketing with one song but that that i mean a
data/006819.wav|it's probably not good to do
data/014477.wav|idea about all the abuse of it blizzard i
data/020158.wav|and the information highway but they feel more alone and
data/018310.wav|an ad for a samsung monitor it
data/001470.wav|angela merkel yeah merkel's gone now
data/029449.wav|in the world quick outside this room and so
data/026991.wav|the pretty like random tuesday watching modern family ads you know what i'm saying they're not they
data/027754.wav|news you've heard not just all week but maybe you're all life the
data/018051.wav|we need to get there immediately but look what's happened according to reports i
data/009785.wav|i'm not worried i'm not worried a
data/021302.wav|amazing year because brands are starting to realize just how desperate they are to get the audience that creators have got
data/022785.wav|are making money hand over fist let's buy
data/032068.wav|not want anyone to pull a mizzy and bloor was the only
data/025912.wav|denied him his prize money denied him
data/009647.wav|well positivity it's like blind positivity
data/023556.wav|want to win versus netflix they can now use the fact
data/016807.wav|the vast majority of people will be in asia if you guys notice here the red is asia
data/009793.wav|crane a sovereign nation but the problem is like the damage is is just as bad to europe as it is to russia really
data/018619.wav|okay so netflix got a huge advantage
data/002077.wav|wait on this hand dude and i'll say that's life oh wife lover yeah
data/002486.wav|i even like psychological trickery it's that the big companies just won't they just bully the store all but the biggest stores either they'll have an agreement or they'll
data/009258.wav|at the chatter here atriarch how
data/018973.wav|they thought they could do better they thought hey this stuff's all too long let's make stuff like this we'll put
data/022990.wav|in additional game levels enhanced graphics for a fee there's money being made
data/024386.wav|they didn't want to film in new york
data/028610.wav|it turned out to be pretty smart thank god
data/026248.wav|of three trillion dollars the highest valuation for a company in human history there are a few possible edge cases the dutch east india company was worth maybe 7 trillion at the height of
data/019968.wav|we're absolutely nothing it's always crazy to me that like in his off time steve jobs founded pixar lucasfilm george lucas's company
data/016869.wav|and scariest things it has potential to be like a complete unlock of resources for humanity to enjoy a golden age of prosperity and has a potential to be a
data/024280.wav|with movies all the villains are played by
data/015626.wav|wait legacy shows the office parks and rec but then their originals sucked
data/030387.wav|if the thing is going through the bags going through and it beeps or
data/030541.wav|in the garage of this apartment complex and he was taking the bike down there
data/015203.wav|and you'll notice it with this example
data/024218.wav|it's expensive ads of all time these are the 10 most expensive ads ever created they
data/028800.wav|which i probably wouldn't keep making that same amount if you
data/022074.wav|in the matter most brand fails
data/001797.wav|his works and i wasn't able to look at my
data/031410.wav|well yeah i mean i don't
data/019384.wav|so we had to make this slide because it was demanded by the actual teacher of the class this was actually i remember talking to teacher and he was like you you have to you you have to credit some other people
data/022675.wav|oh those trade deals memes trade offer you receive
data/009732.wav|it to i thought in my mind oh there's an object called nail polish remover just
data/023501.wav|the the strategy of scarcity to get artificially increased their
data/018067.wav|are you saying pepsi man uses coke are you saying pepsi man uses coke i'm saying
data/013078.wav|you're actually wanting to learn and focus
data/019886.wav|watch the games this is early days of games media we still had magazines for christ's sake and you could pay off those magazines
data/011841.wav|in good like it looks well
data/017812.wav|and that was that was a quick quick and
data/016453.wav|extremely negative for the average worker uh certain market forces
data/019622.wav|the badge yeah every four years
data/015048.wav|the internet was getting faster and
data/003794.wav|at the time anyway but i'll be i'll be live in
data/030734.wav|what's the most used emote in
data/015621.wav|and it did not seem to did not seem expected
data/001236.wav|right i don't think like if you gave the
data/029318.wav|and they're wearing they're wearing nice business casual
data/015109.wav|in previous marketing mondays it's one of
data/007598.wav|if the truck love your content but through
data/017833.wav|make it a little more concise than the three
data/029091.wav|that's what it was going to be it
data/022414.wav|it's because it's already over he
data/014223.wav|and that means you only go to these platforms when you're already big which is not a way to build a service that is not a way to to grow up and that means like if
data/029407.wav|one that i was like kidnapped and the ransom was 20 bucks
data/030074.wav|a few months is a few months but to me
data/023938.wav|are you gay what does this have to do with the shoes answer the question
data/004579.wav|wait for szechuan sauce you guys are the same so here we go
data/001770.wav|white will be remade over and over and over until we die and it'll be remade
data/021271.wav|and if you'll notice if you watch any big creators you'll notice some of the biggest creators are doing not just fine on youtube but amazing on youtube for example tommy
data/021156.wav|it was a kid i'd really like it feels like it appeals to kids kids are the most likely to be
data/020073.wav|and social twitch was also bought for one billion dollars around the same time two companies made acquisitions okay
data/002793.wav|do you think you're doing where's casey frey
data/027243.wav|can learn from and even improve on i don't think anyone who is serious about it will say that the ui i don't think any
data/003897.wav|worse still pushing forward with the
data/004129.wav|big a how's that chip bill
data/027532.wav|can say with quite confidence that twitter management has been underperforming they also made what could be called one of the worst the single worst social media business decision of all time which is
data/023668.wav|the dish out right now for a place to stay on less than six hours notice it's
data/027270.wav|in a cowboy hat going like a truck but kind
data/001724.wav|when he's right and he's on
data/009812.wav|interesting and i'm saying interesting to be nice economic times right now certainly america is not immune and
data/027279.wav|i have leaned into it i mean they have the prepare to die edition they've had ads
data/012481.wav|i didn't really help and then i get text messages i wonder if i
data/012198.wav|and comes down to the basement sits down helps me out
data/008488.wav|middle ground you guys bring brazil to me middle ground that seems fair everyone in brazil and the culture get up go up south america we'll even meet in the middle okay i'll meet you guys in
data/031375.wav|palace bro and we go in there and it's just like pure modern art you know the kind of like the art on the wall looks like just like imagine this everywhere
data/030558.wav|don't tell your wife i'll ask her i'm gonna
data/005557.wav|i drove because i had i had
data/010097.wav|if you like them they're not available in
data/030252.wav|we have just gaming just gaming after about two three
data/017488.wav|unions dead or dying and corporate america
data/008689.wav|i think bloomberg business by matt levine he's a good writer and
data/022993.wav|and so this is pretty compelling evidence they knew what was going on they didn't need this and they just wanted the cut they just wanted the fat stacks and despite the fact that yes steve jobs
data/016127.wav|things go well that's what i do i hope
data/023953.wav|alan canada but it actually already existed in america
data/029012.wav|oh dude oh go on the beach man go run on
data/016023.wav|it makes a marketing monday yes yes i'm trying to pivot out of
data/012100.wav|my name was earl and he was darth
data/010551.wav|me to feel anything listen i've been there i've been there i understand and it's it's it's a struggle that no one else can understand unless they've been through
data/027202.wav|and so because there was this one chance to try things that were
data/008379.wav|influencers today as part of my
data/008250.wav|and talk about his time he's one of the earliest
data/018484.wav|true you guys are right there they are worth quite a bit but nvidia's not that far behind you we're top
data/023538.wav|it underneath what it costs to make
data/031370.wav|a reputable news source that he only made three thousand dollars from this
data/011810.wav|it's cool and then i get to meet the actors and i'm gonna give you the second plus the second plus and probably the biggest plus of the entire thing is that there is a series of actors who
data/002621.wav|please the straw i'm cheering for you on this
data/006390.wav|it'd be good at something dead
data/024875.wav|how much do you think this trinket is
data/020085.wav|now let me tell you the story because
data/023340.wav|and he's a celebrity among them and that's worth it turns out a staggering amount of money in an age where
data/025404.wav|we to watch this coke ad i
data/025618.wav|and immediately roblox went down but i
data/022119.wav|what this is our shot but
data/030083.wav|i might like like the bond we're
data/012809.wav|he was like bossing us all around he would tell me to play zillion and
data/013627.wav|as the mischievous drama so i
data/029123.wav|at the community you see this fossil is an item with absolutely no use or function until so i i'm the one that jumped into the
data/006895.wav|lower pack heights and i would skateboard to work down that big hill
data/023466.wav|i better than the other there's just no other way to
data/020831.wav|but after a year almost of putting in the work in the trenches to bring marketing content to you the viewer it feels great
data/001875.wav|well i checked out twitch and uh
data/029991.wav|or why it's just like i i
data/025209.wav|we player that game is like part of a skinner box to be
data/013185.wav|a huge portion of my chat lives in one
data/009858.wav|it's like one of the reasons americans romanticized college so much it was because the only time in their lives they get to live like near friends in a nice walkable neighborhood
data/007467.wav|it's at ten percent chance and
data/003648.wav|if you kind of reset the scale and don't have generational inherited
data/032342.wav|and the rest of hog whatever time
data/020731.wav|based tweet deserved brand tweet of the
data/014352.wav|it's just like an easy way to live stream for normies and they can just live stream
data/028954.wav|i mean i had a great time but again i
data/001991.wav|you get a waffle maker it's pretty easy to make you have to
data/029597.wav|and his i think great competitive mentality is actually rubbing off on the
data/019426.wav|of those things that is the absolute perfect and most
data/024387.wav|they built a gigantic duplicate on a set it includes costume costumes designed by
data/016473.wav|trends that are changing the world right now okay let's start off by talking about everybody's favorite
data/022170.wav|this one is called silence of love and this is not even an english
data/027309.wav|it will be very easy for them to be like in a moment of weakness make the game easy so
data/013233.wav|randomly on a saturday they just go hey silk songs here boom it would break the
data/006963.wav|i was connected i don't do taxes it's probably a bad thing too probably
data/023218.wav|you pretty much can't sell food
data/005661.wav|because she was like totally yeah i thought for a league player she'd be
data/012076.wav|i get the actors big props they kind of make the whole
data/029682.wav|it was up yeah yeah yeah actually
data/023255.wav|it almost feels like a beverage
data/002531.wav|what the way he wants to go for it but i'm
data/022517.wav|time on i literally think if they just fired their entire marketing team and just showed 30 seconds unbroken of a whopper looking
data/001545.wav|but i'm going to shake sapphire shake sapphire
data/027909.wav|that everything else is sort of popping tech stocks
data/007165.wav|to celebrate so loudly that's my opinion i do is my take i
data/031352.wav|a ridiculous amount of community service
data/011040.wav|you know what if you like
data/022954.wav|when this was leaked also from the thing epic games in
data/029153.wav|i love this game i love pokemon i'm happy to do it again i do it again i get to about
data/000195.wav|it's coming my brother is the most fun gambler in the world he's a
data/031436.wav|like every single time it got a little annoying i think to my compatriots so i lob in
data/032198.wav|it's basically war it's basically like fancy war it's
data/001932.wav|trim at night and it's like i like both of
data/002113.wav|and it basically came down to his vote and
data/032335.wav|with only two of those being in the final phase he also didn't use
data/006454.wav|so if you don't mind let's go buy some crypto right after this
data/007070.wav|in scar that's what i thought was happening most times like when someone would come up to me and ask for a picture i was like yeah
data/000827.wav|if you guys some of you
data/014587.wav|show ever which is not true they're
data/031389.wav|or through power through the drinking
data/013247.wav|things can't get dangerous for you
data/028559.wav|so they don't count it as income which
data/031495.wav|it has the mental part of chess and you have to be fast and not just fast but really really really like
data/008214.wav|democratic party is going to lose very very very badly and mid terms and you know i i they do many many things that i disagree democratic party is going to lose very very very badly in midterms and
data/029946.wav|we are winning a big turkey
data/028659.wav|i go to michael's i go to michael's and
data/028668.wav|when i go back and do my work dude
data/023193.wav|and and so as long as they've eaten grass at one point in their life they can say safely that it was grass-fed all you have to do is give them grass once this is most likely a grass-fed cow
data/009301.wav|at a higher price would be good i think i think there's a couple
data/003541.wav|but anything you don't love it's not
data/016957.wav|you can get a free stock by using my
data/026835.wav|just for the slot let alone what it
data/014529.wav|about i'm glad someone said it thank you king and then miss kim said
data/015804.wav|there's a lot of a lot of weird
data/023678.wav|where to send me hearts bro and then she said give your driver's health
data/030565.wav|what that doesn't look like me you think i got
data/009061.wav|hold up hold up hold on
data/013129.wav|through connery's pants but i had
data/003046.wav|that's not part of it hey wins it fails though
data/018337.wav|and they have existed for i believe let me get this right 17 years
data/006188.wav|with me i was like oh
data/019934.wav|six years later has that been worth it how much is twitch worth to amazon now
data/023502.wav|the perceived value human beings generally think that things that are scarce are worthwhile and so you can spend a lot less
data/015051.wav|if he's open up netflix on the browser and when you're choosing to rent a dvd
data/020082.wav|for a six figure salary yes it is
data/003248.wav|it would you couldn't buy three percent
data/002325.wav|the let's go watch somebody else who we're
data/019751.wav|it's all kind of weird it's all kind of dark and it's all kind of new this is my whether the week because it was way more fire than it had any
data/019288.wav|what what is the early demand looking like Afghanistan area more excited for the
data/015802.wav|i don't think it's like a debate really i think netflix has more
data/021329.wav|into this problem people are just generally lonelier i think they have generally
data/008849.wav|the what do you mean could he still pursue
data/020333.wav|and maybe a three because of slime's
data/003436.wav|you know that the the discussion is that he may consider making a move on taiwan elected it's not elected by like the people it's by like the other communist party representatives what i believe it is it actually an election amongst the party although the party kind of votes in lockstep with him and you know the the the discussion is that he may consider making a move on taiwan elected it's not elected by like the people it's by like the other communist
data/011782.wav|i didn't i didn't like look at spoilers or anything all i know
data/023563.wav|but for the same people you might be like oh my god a new valerian skin
data/022848.wav|tesla today but i was like you know what
data/023291.wav|so he got there he picked up both
data/000829.wav|i was trying to get to the bottom of this and i couldn't at dinner i kept asking germa okay so
data/031556.wav|this happens he does this insane flank he attacks from the top the bottom
data/031986.wav|i'm a full-time twitch streamer now and half of the people here are ultimate players it's crazy these people are so young and they
data/030494.wav|if she doesn't know so we're sitting there it's
data/020570.wav|the marketing monday cdpr godspeed dude and i
data/011622.wav|lord of the rings she'd never even heard of it and i i had her watch the trilogy
data/016233.wav|my goddamn wedding and made me a whole marketing monday insane
data/021400.wav|i would not bet on gamestop for the long term but it's not dead it's not going to zero so he's like wow this
data/013437.wav|how to hold animals the calming art of
data/000077.wav|drugs wedding no you're not cutie
data/012381.wav|day and that was wrapping up the big finale on night two i'm just
data/012594.wav|what recently so i put i'm
data/016489.wav|we are massive title wave coming and decided to
data/019999.wav|as you can understand sports aka
data/001702.wav|lazy poor so why did this happen
data/021528.wav|the problem is to hurt them we
data/000241.wav|we're pissed and he's just losing it
data/001546.wav|would you like to participate in this edition of
data/031326.wav|they have some very strict laws around it so for one sip of water
data/008025.wav|and around every corner you could find a dragon that could kill you and and like
data/027350.wav|it is sort of a good way to um think
data/003854.wav|if some weirdos but it's fine
data/019595.wav|no it's not a song you idiot
data/008760.wav|and then he obviously tweeted before the deal
data/006528.wav|we face on it right they
data/025371.wav|it was on a weekend i was like i kind of
data/029380.wav|it wouldn't be a problem but i opened my mouth and
data/023543.wav|we're going up a lot recently because they're burning money
data/014407.wav|to a youtube channel it's just much easier
data/024958.wav|on the rise and scariness of gotcha
data/020194.wav|if the idea let us improve brand perception with twitter this is why twitter can't make any money
data/031573.wav|for the first time is like wait what flash
data/000300.wav|i was just so shell-shocked that
data/014002.wav|was last day um i will be thinking
data/015504.wav|who's going to survive of these two because they are
data/003322.wav|everyone who did that workers who switched jobs received wage increases over of
data/024937.wav|i can throw the credit card down they do not want to actually have to get better because psychologically that is seemingly baked into our brains it's
data/019255.wav|they usually make bad decisions and when they are struggling for market share and trying to to win a competition they make good decisions if you I mean you guys
data/027100.wav|if you look at the roman republic even after they went to
data/005264.wav|it is where it gets weird
data/008414.wav|it was like bro i do the exact same thing with yours which means we are literally human
data/013061.wav|or full-time like he ran his own marketing agency and then
data/014257.wav|more influence among influencers than they
data/001615.wav|literally the only vegetables i've eaten
data/016674.wav|are desperate for solutions for their bad sleep they want to sleep longer
data/013116.wav|if i keep this up literally my net worth will triple okay i read this on a
data/003927.wav|the third party people i mean this
data/030228.wav|is piss race anyway it was an impressive piss race
data/023334.wav|i spoke about in my marketing money predictions way back in january uh just about the rise of influencers
data/024029.wav|so that they can get all the money they
data/027092.wav|stock market is is down a bit this year maybe because of inflation i want to ask you specifically about inflation are we looking at a prolonged decline
data/028727.wav|i know and i'm begging dude get me
data/027594.wav|because he said i hope elon
data/018225.wav|when they um glom onto something that's
data/003943.wav|what the president i mean listen
data/018280.wav|i think it was written by
data/001931.wav|right now i i work all day and then
data/030374.wav|i literally forgot where in this messy
data/030405.wav|i have a ring and then he gets it
data/013090.wav|what those you're getting a little farther from
data/018680.wav|worldwide over two to one microsoft got their ass kicked i
data/015689.wav|if the worse than hiring you guys they can't do worse
data/012166.wav|they have a they have like space poker okay they called it pizaak and it's
data/016461.wav|they applied for small businesses in order to keep on their employees and did not keep on the employees
data/006831.wav|there isn't any popping sounds but what you can do is get 10 hours of
data/028975.wav|just thinking about what am i
data/018338.wav|and they are going public at a valuation of like 15 billion or
data/030451.wav|like it became it was like almost like a
data/006180.wav|the baby yeah yeah that's what
data/020784.wav|to lack a certain heart it was the best
data/012120.wav|and everyone's happy and uh and and
data/010440.wav|please ignore my sub love the content what a strange message nine month viewer nine month chatter i figured that
data/017376.wav|this is the last 10 years they've gone
data/019811.wav|these he's got he's got good insights okay number eight number eight number eight number eight number eight now this is
data/010370.wav|i don't think she'd explain it though and then
data/021653.wav|is this canon cause like i i i run a a fan fiction webpage is this i need to
data/015197.wav|over the world and then exporting great shows
data/001150.wav|ten minutes ago there were two
data/024816.wav|for monetizing mobile game players with free
data/016243.wav|and that of course is lebron james thank you to
data/018532.wav|on a company that will help your competitor okay that's not why you do it
data/004342.wav|when he just laughs and moves on i'm i'm knocked out how about quincy how about quincy what
data/023345.wav|gucci right he's not a generalized celebrity but it doesn't matter anymore he's a micro celebrity to people that buy disc
data/016826.wav|unless of our time watching those quibby bad example
data/015482.wav|costs more than a month of disney plus so if they put everything on disney plus instead of you buying all
data/029062.wav|with to everyone already left and my mom has to
data/005938.wav|it's going to be so so so entertaining everyone
data/029837.wav|some bangers if he says we got
data/005395.wav|we had some really cool conversations um
data/011590.wav|want to have the same opinion as you it ruins it for me it makes me re-evaluate and my
data/004172.wav|ask that question eye motions that's the
data/013810.wav|and not make the games exclusive and it was announced this week revealed sorry
data/012329.wav|so like for example they like there was one night where we had like
data/024293.wav|i did a good job i listen i'm not really in the market for a jag but if you're the type of person who might have that income and might be attracted that
data/011391.wav|watch ads to make up for that
data/005585.wav|so there's more than a pizza per person it's literally
data/031619.wav|at you're a foreigner in starcraft
data/022754.wav|and put it on this new thing called the internet
data/015328.wav|the the rights and they're spending like another quarter of a billion just to make the show lord of the rings is already set to be the most expensive show of all time and it hasn't even been made yet okay
data/031993.wav|we've been disappearing from the scene
data/002219.wav|you're basically said like so if
data/010285.wav|is apparently about apparently he walked around with photos of me and
data/005006.wav|he agreed to buy the company at
data/010073.wav|two months ago i just kept buying it i kept using it but obviously i didn't talk about it on stream because i didn't want
data/017442.wav|okay that's the difference for me the
data/011901.wav|right you don't want that's not what you
data/026799.wav|what acquisitions it's facebook facebook and google are the most in the headlights of
data/029829.wav|if the first time i ever met oscar this was the first
data/026458.wav|you can apply this to almost anything that you
data/000369.wav|on my bachelor party i have lost
data/027537.wav|that being said and even though i've ragged on tesla's stock price before because i think it's crazy high tesla is a good company so as opposed to what's happened at twitter which has been disaster
data/014300.wav|nuclear bomb number one most important one of the biggest twitch prime twitch prime is an absolute nuke of the streaming moore's because it's so so so much free money sloshing around for creators to nuclear bomb number one most important one of the biggest twitch prime twitch prime is an absolute nuke of the streaming wars because it's so so so
data/018902.wav|the billions of dollars of investor money and we'll make a bunch of
data/029370.wav|but i'm not awkward so i'm starting to
data/023853.wav|it just says now more delicious so but the thing is people
data/029359.wav|as like oh yeah this place is great i mean it's it's nice and let me tell you it was nice but it was
data/024392.wav|we can all agree that seems like it cost
data/028944.wav|image studying abroad it was a very very fun time although i will say if you go somewhere like seoul or
data/024966.wav|canadians complain about sony more than any other brand on social media taiwan
data/015565.wav|disney the house of mouse roku is the buzzer the buzzard
data/028022.wav|the state of the union on unions uh
data/017559.wav|and the most valuable brand in the world okay so how did they get their brand to be worth so much more than everyone else's including other big tech companies that have you know massive scale and most people think it's advertising people think
data/005021.wav|easy clap we probably will we do outside of that
data/001468.wav|i would have accepted the queen even though that's not doesn't really
data/028181.wav|like their revenue like their profit like their chances of survival
data/031357.wav|and i get suspended by the way my mom is just you might as well just deal drugs
data/028103.wav|crazy insane levels of lockdowns across major cities the most impacted being shanghai and they are now starting to pay a serious price for it their economy is slowing rapidly because literally factories can't run trucks can't move everything is so shut down that it's actually causing a severe crunch so
data/018048.wav|it's i'm pretty good this is pepsi
data/022127.wav|as nicer than i was because at the time i said brands feigning suicidal thoughts to more
data/023661.wav|the way better than me i invested in america by
data/028232.wav|the entire interview was a front and i see the real board that we all know he hid it
data/027830.wav|you sell it for way more than it costs to make it's a decent business but the problem is their margin is going down
data/030789.wav|so if you want to ask about almost any rap
data/003116.wav|i have heard if i'm being honest i'm doing not
data/019758.wav|and most overhyped games of all time we're
data/000913.wav|this is true art without audio
data/021956.wav|wait a minute but if we do it who can copy us you need
data/025166.wav|this guy just was like vibing to a classic 70s track
data/022101.wav|it's more now obviously people got really upset so they doubled down
data/000164.wav|we wake up the next day we don't remember a
data/001828.wav|in the desert is a very expensive proposition it's a it's not it's not something that's uh totally
data/021429.wav|you make a bet on robinhood they sell the information about that to these major hedge funds is that legal it is legal but it's very unethical it's very shady and there they go to great lengths to not talk about it robin hood's largest client and largest customer is citadel capital okay citadel pays robin hood
data/025569.wav|it can go without sleeping without stopping and there is no ban on killer robots so we're we're in a interesting time
data/025516.wav|and dollars the demand for ps5s
data/006628.wav|i can't tell you what's worse though sitting next to my dad i'm wasting money and watching that game or
data/018098.wav|oh i curse your very name
data/030089.wav|i like screen i'm like scream i'm like
data/016985.wav|if you're interested at all and if not don't worry
data/028267.wav|most no no no no no someone in chat said she was
data/010850.wav|the thought involved you me you me

data/007184.wav|peak amount of grind for melee i did get top
data/003156.wav|one ios for tracking except for apple which can now track their users freely and
data/017446.wav|well there was plenty of that happening at
data/027705.wav|we get a free slot for signing up so there's no real reason
data/006979.wav|with the year it's like hey did you save half because it's
data/031877.wav|but unfortunately we'll have to wait for
data/010078.wav|pretty well they liked it um it's pretty sweet
data/006298.wav|content ideas and tips and how to format for youtube
data/027266.wav|for that had like missing rivets doors that weren't hinged properly and they were
data/019398.wav|and i put this in a slide that i showed in front of the entire class
data/013765.wav|if this will save blizzard thank god riot
data/009641.wav|don't worry we got this late all we have to do is farm up okay we keep farming
data/028815.wav|i realized very quickly that sf rents
data/029395.wav|i just don't have it i don't have i have
data/023517.wav|who have a lot of money the average ferrari owner
data/026770.wav|if the privacy for a while now apple did a whole privacy push
data/029098.wav|that baby elon musk oh i wanted to watch this dude i wanted to watch the history of
data/002801.wav|without further ado i think it's time for wins
data/002758.wav|and quack get working on a video for this because we need to make the money back
data/012365.wav|and tell the bartender a code but the thing about the bartender
data/013818.wav|i've mentioned this on previous marketing mondays but the way this generation of
data/025960.wav|it's negative momentum like this and such bad pr what you end up with is a brain drain this is the biggest threat to accompany a blizzard size and
data/018892.wav|some kind of video i could show you a new streaming service aimed at the younger generation quibby is short for quick bites all the
data/025568.wav|the can kill at night or in the day it can kill at night or in the day they
data/025407.wav|the real contest will be is it worse than the iconic kendall jenner pepsi ad that is the real question who has made the worst
data/013064.wav|that guy and he was passionate about it because it was his
data/025718.wav|of came up with skittles presents bite size
data/016885.wav|it's like every crater on twitch did not get better when the pandemic happened but they got richer you know what i'm saying because
data/015611.wav|earlier in this breakdown i referred to
data/007948.wav|twelve months one year of laughs pog champ
data/026665.wav|is going to explain he was a major major major believer he was a major believer that professionalized
data/016863.wav|been growing at a massively 10x
data/013370.wav|will tab that means we're gonna
data/004457.wav|day day signs and just hoping for a a
data/026081.wav|well but this you actually add an image and to
data/027460.wav|the official tumblr account was hanging
data/013542.wav|but like 17 different people probably that
data/000783.wav|i have my rock solid plan on sunday when i'm up i'll walk away and so what i do is on sunday after that very nice dinner at
data/016507.wav|we don't got time for that so instead of five hours i'm
data/023835.wav|what he had made it had
data/008626.wav|well employees leave out of like they don't know
data/017046.wav|i just literally do make the rules
data/023695.wav|that's so funny that you're just setting
data/013746.wav|i like to hate on me when i say tesla might not be worth more than every other car company on earth combined they might not have been adding the value of three mcdonald's in the past two months maybe the stocks overvalued maybe the fact that he's constantly finding
data/010250.wav|every leech that is downstream from the
data/017897.wav|at the farm i broke my leg straight down 21
data/011082.wav|it's like i'm too quiet come on man you know
data/010209.wav|wow how could that possibly have happened oh i'm just a streamer it was
data/012188.wav|we're open seat but you need an opponent
data/004688.wav|that's that's where i that's where i shine
data/023498.wav|if the brand they lose their perceived value and they can't charge as high prices
data/007587.wav|well if anyone's there i had a blast really cool time really cool time
data/014344.wav|more people nuclear bomb of youtube is that the size of youtube is so so so so much bigger the the max cap on what you can do on
data/016751.wav|i are developed world and it's leading to a
data/001370.wav|you're my first you're the person okay you have to tell me i'm

data/000897.wav|are you just an early gang fanatic the
data/020500.wav|it over the ceo of spotify literally

data/020090.wav|do you want to sell sugar water or do you want to change the world and so he gets the ceo of pepsi to come
data/012499.wav|per night which is really high
data/019689.wav|but answering my crazy youtube request for
data/004843.wav|it'd be able to see it
data/011538.wav|the problem is the weave army grows by
data/016616.wav|yeah i mean this happened in japan but
data/007916.wav|i think almost all of them are
data/000451.wav|apple and vodka all night but i get very hungers and so at
data/011114.wav|it does keep it simple it does keep it simple all right well he says i think
data/018445.wav|you already have all of your games on steam a massive library if they could just find an easy way for you to stream those
data/003125.wav|i worked at amazon for three years
data/026587.wav|if it's a drama filled situation call because when you dm someone's gonna leak it and it's gonna make you look foolish you can record a call okay that's different though because i don't think pokeman is
data/025086.wav|to go to university phoenix often feel
data/003808.wav|one person to go to jail that goes to beat him up
data/017525.wav|were you guys to mean so now you can say yep clock

data/030346.wav|and then bam kind of go separate ways still you know off and on but she went to japan for an internship
data/009711.wav|i have yet to notice any clever wordplay but i did notice
data/007004.wav|and i was walking to my seat and one guy
data/027827.wav|but let's look at this actual company so this is
data/001680.wav|by the names oompa and lumpa
data/008762.wav|like whoa these spam bots though i don't
data/009590.wav|when the nexus dies on each side
data/032117.wav|but juggle guy that was a rough year
data/019678.wav|but it's there so if they
data/017178.wav|that i get to play it is the only benefit to having shitty ass
data/027535.wav|the stage with that because i want you to know that like even if you are
data/010611.wav|oh shoot just pretend we're in a meeting you know
data/002333.wav|the years ago yeah yeah you
data/032332.wav|and it is not a coincidence that he chose
data/027688.wav|starting with a major win for a group that needs it more than anyone else weird old white guys in politics this Twitter user
data/019073.wav|i because um if a character in a show
data/017401.wav|as meeting and that's fine okay it's popular clip
data/022998.wav|if the clans money they get a cut off spotify money they get to cut off
data/026597.wav|are in awe someone who's so eloquent at the art of sales at convincing customers to be interested in a product that it blows you away that it blows you away i've seen one of those markers today and his name is
data/012837.wav|money on this vegas tournament let's cancel it because it was like a
data/013822.wav|in the console wars okay four
data/022036.wav|at a tearful heartfelt apology immediately deleted
data/020307.wav|is for parents of kids this age it's it's clever it shows the
data/023266.wav|no you can't it's marketing you
data/003159.wav|a very profitable ad network targeted
data/000119.wav|in the world with it but i it was that was about
data/001778.wav|that's not the issue here i'm saying a
data/031593.wav|oh cool i know it seems like if you don't know what's going on it's it's just pixels bro
data/030136.wav|he's annoyed but he would be
data/001021.wav|have the same dog no you're lying you're
data/014278.wav|those things have power because that brings an entire ecosystem people
data/027807.wav|we're making a solid profit whether you had a solid fundamental business model as long as you're growing and so that's why companies like peloton and zoom
data/024649.wav|doing great we're doing great we're
data/006466.wav|if the market downturn or crash that was that was supposed to indicate
data/024690.wav|it is not financial advice do whatever you
data/020543.wav|working triple time just to get this part back to to
data/020092.wav|you do not end up getting along and they forced steve out of apple in
data/023579.wav|they were they were losing so much money on
data/011409.wav|and everyone was pissed myself included because you don't put mango at
data/027667.wav|it's from those and then get you
data/025677.wav|the shock value ad was memorable where
data/015730.wav|what does happen and i did mention this you actually tell me this is true what what everyone is starting to what does happen and i didn't mention this actually tell me if this is true
data/028325.wav|do you want to watch and
data/028534.wav|while we're we're full like we we
data/001095.wav|i made a bunch of friends i went
data/012164.wav|one faction because i was only getting the evil stuff and you know i wanted to try
data/014370.wav|the way for game developers to grow
data/026983.wav|i you know what you know i like this ad
data/025736.wav|it's the concept the problem is most of the time when i hear someone say this one's actually a pretty good commercial it's a commercial that has nothing to
data/008587.wav|and you're like okay it would be financially irresponsible of me to not take this deal even though i don't want you to own my car you are offering me such an extreme upside that i pretty much have to take it
data/028089.wav|at the motorola guy who is an awful presenter anyway the whole time you could tell that steve jobs
data/021055.wav|you can ship your pants right here
data/013259.wav|i don't really do much melee on stream but if it's really funny i'll check it out is that why ludwig
data/003848.wav|not saying i'm just saying that he has marketed himself well to
data/014501.wav|cameras weren't getting paid by anyone because twitch wasn't offering to pay
data/031000.wav|and i thought it was funny i mean
data/025476.wav|i actually made a dent in some of uh
data/008317.wav|cause the quarterly date hasn't come out yet i
data/023100.wav|what are the main things they'll do is they will rename products that have been named the same way for thousands of years
data/024448.wav|it's that shows me basically trending new commercials every week that have been
data/022650.wav|the internet and is now laying on
data/015887.wav|so we'd have to it would have to grow
data/006808.wav|play history to be a top player to be like a top top player never
data/018628.wav|the beginning i mean it's not the end it is the beginning microsoft is very likely going to spend more money to acquire more studios and more exclusives and try to get a completely unbeatable cloud gaming service
data/029181.wav|just make it all democracy and made this vote
data/027515.wav|and the utensils or hashtag team
data/004977.wav|and i only found this with
data/004918.wav|and so they basically uh they
data/031537.wav|early on right right i think basically here okay and
data/018673.wav|so they were happy it all worked out
data/020737.wav|rebrand was tone deaf almost every brand
data/012207.wav|maybe even younger he's probably like
data/009356.wav|it got a great video the video of me responding to that guy
data/008249.wav|talk about i mean we can ask him
data/018001.wav|well that's one solution we could kill everyone everyone right now i feel like to stop people
data/026849.wav|and so we'll start with the squarespace
data/009948.wav|with chance that there could be some sort of middle ground that we can sort of discuss the pros and cons of things it's either
data/025528.wav|that sony has set aside and and absolutely staggering for them 13 to
data/009950.wav|okay it's black or white yeah i get it no i understand i understand
data/017732.wav|sort of see here all this post merger stuff
data/014039.wav|they don't need numbers they need legitimacy they need people who are not leaders but followers to feel safe taking the plunge and switching over okay once ludwig has done it
data/030925.wav|it's wall and they have silhouettes of every champion so like a silhouette of pantheon
data/002689.wav|i have just picked an anime slash history
data/031374.wav|we show up to a malibu
data/007539.wav|eating my big crispy burger nice
data/024285.wav|me tell you a couple reasons why
data/025207.wav|if the for free and required you to pay a lot of money to get anything and players got so furious that the developer
data/032337.wav|one who knows the hustle knows that i have never used spells ever
data/025613.wav|the illuminati and the robot lizard people that zuckerberg is trying to
data/031501.wav|she's of uno are too much well
data/016802.wav|are entering the global economy they'll need
data/031905.wav|okay i i can tell you another
data/012934.wav|actually if you look at it nowadays social media is like the most important social media and influencers are like by
data/032272.wav|he is so degenerate to gamble he won't
data/016645.wav|where's this opportunity if you're interested in working in the field of alternate
data/023338.wav|in the million dollar contract with a brand to sponsor paul macbeth the
data/031123.wav|like the competition wasn't that fierce
data/026766.wav|it's so out of the blue but i want to talk
data/012163.wav|i tell you about the highlight of the trip for me okay because during day two i started to realize that
data/005932.wav|i say about this actually i want to
data/026519.wav|that of the proponents of nfts like
data/010184.wav|really worried i'll watch it off camera and just they'll see my reaction
data/018444.wav|the elephant in the room that no one's talking about
data/021949.wav|and i i like stressed about it and i was like what what's the difference
data/008619.wav|think more realistically they're going to make
data/003706.wav|a cool mop or you invent something that's cool and
data/007863.wav|can you sell those giant foam fingers but
data/017689.wav|what's considered a bad idea companies
data/006460.wav|i spend all the time for their artists to create the assets in their game of everyone else's blockchain items it's so much extra work and doesn't help
data/026663.wav|like a weasel or a rat
data/005377.wav|it's not my fault it's not my fault i
data/020887.wav|misinterpreting steel chats ideas for your job brilliant give me an idea right now give me a marketing idea your films i want to steal it what's your idea frames when games that's my idea you made this i made this nvidia graphics trading cards
data/016418.wav|a bunch of money is printed at
data/025493.wav|which we bought so right now he's he bought
data/022405.wav|so that's the ad but there's there's multiples they all revolved around they would get the point across in the first i
data/011415.wav|saul sick it was so sick
data/021293.wav|in the player you can just rewind live and this watch
data/001034.wav|there's probably somebody who lives and breathes
data/002068.wav|no end of an era the
data/008994.wav|it's like it's like when you
data/029834.wav|yeah he's admitted to it yeah he should
data/011673.wav|for two days two days in prison it's just as i
data/013304.wav|answer to that question you'll know my answer no i
data/003139.wav|just a few years ago when kylie jenner i know
data/014763.wav|with the person i think i brought him on stream for an interview
data/023858.wav|back off and they went back to the original
data/021067.wav|chocolate peanuts caramel peanut butter pretzels never heard of it where have you been under a rock new to me what were you born yesterday
data/007513.wav|what a finished you think he didn't finish that was the breakfast
data/030839.wav|like something about how i'm always wearing tank tops on stream no that's not why i'm not wearing one
data/024742.wav|in consoles then we added the pc to the mix in the late 80s then handheld comes
data/029844.wav|wait it was us for right when we all
data/020866.wav|the years and the reason is because of taxes
data/026495.wav|in the contents of the collected storyboards of
data/032338.wav|be which on stream the move
data/015727.wav|what piracy was a was a bigger impact it's not piracy is on the downswing i know that everybody says like everyone in my chat you know people that are
data/006614.wav|it collapsed i don't think i did marketing mondays it
data/029523.wav|the first guy to beat all five gods which yeah you you hear that and you're like okay intellectually speaking yeah like that must mean it's very hard to beat
data/000304.wav|so night one goes great we go back to these these sweets
data/023451.wav|the perceived value is what the is what the customer thinks of your product customers will only buy something if they think they're getting more value than what it costs now let's say let's say my margin right now let's say
data/028341.wav|to a kind of intense one and i can see dj we kind of focusing and and ben's always focusing
data/014065.wav|ludwig's motivation and leadership and connection with auto
data/006964.wav|probably a bad thing too um
data/022241.wav|up for me was the acting of the old man he went
data/011240.wav|in the contest for most crowns don't talk about don't bring this up
data/013524.wav|it's good energy okay that's the kind of energy you need to attack corporate life
data/006957.wav|call themselves crazy if you're a
data/024393.wav|it's too much they could have gotten a similar effect for cheaper in fact i don't even think it needed to be nicole kidman my call is a thumbs down a bit of
data/007100.wav|it's obviously obviously i've already seen
data/029030.wav|like arguing about it and we had been with the group we'd been with the girl
data/027828.wav|what the sheet that someone posted on twitter and
data/030506.wav|cause i know that it's cheesy dude
data/030126.wav|we're all the games i'll say
data/013713.wav|what i want is i mean this could also be
data/020246.wav|in my room let's talk about the three things
data/009306.wav|so there should be something how can it be gambling
data/000617.wav|about this thing and again until this point it has been honestly i'm not kidding i
data/026223.wav|owed money exactly on time with no missed payments it's it's fine
data/019291.wav|it is extremely favored over the Xbox that
data/022842.wav|time warner cable with aol stock so everyone at
data/028375.wav|it's don't work corporate environments everyone's talk everyone refers to
data/015578.wav|several started going outside again they weren't stuck inside
data/018632.wav|for gamers today is like most
data/020844.wav|as and hopefully we can talk through it in a funny and interesting kind of way that's all we're asking hopefully we'll go out a little bit more intelligent a little more thoughtful than we came in
data/014562.wav|i watched him every morning and the fact
data/015498.wav|the grow they can prove they can make these
data/004375.wav|sketch eating a bowl of cheerios while doing a backflip like that can be
data/006550.wav|move past it that being said they currently aren't so i
data/026041.wav|willpower power is the main thing that's scary about it
data/027787.wav|it out of control once that starts to get crazy the government has only one
data/026285.wav|after you've bought it and this could be
data/018374.wav|wonder whether your boss likes you on that day does it like you on that day and isn't a bad mood what if i'm a prostitute my pimp never tells wonder whether your boss likes you on that day doesn't like you on that day um is it a bad mood what if i'm a
data/032203.wav|well this has been to build my confidence
data/030043.wav|marketing monday really taking off damn
data/007356.wav|it would always play chic and then like switch whenever it got hard and he'd
data/007308.wav|and they lost they lost all their first bets but they
data/031384.wav|and he was just a delight
data/028195.wav|i don't want to be in new jersey i can't
data/007926.wav|or yearbook photo that feels like
data/009622.wav|i won the house tournament except for
data/003640.wav|out of the hands of boomers into their no it's
data/031595.wav|when i was 18 years old
data/029673.wav|in a wheelchair over there i hate him
data/003337.wav|but right now there is something and people that have taken the
data/004536.wav|well my guess that it's fine that i actually have a little bit of a delay here
data/017601.wav|i just a video example of
data/031511.wav|in person i i went to korea and was there
data/025919.wav|they did not make a big
data/011172.wav|it oh it's it's awesome but
data/014151.wav|no longer exists okay you're not getting paid and so facing a world where the
data/025278.wav|you can see the crown a very popular show mandalorian
data/022923.wav|one this idea and not a single one can
data/008967.wav|there's no i mean the contract
data/032298.wav|it's awesome let's read the comments and i would be very clear most of the comments were incredibly supportive it was very heartwarming to see after the fucking gracile that i it's awesome let's read the comments and i want to be very clear most of the comments were incredibly supportive it
data/029663.wav|but at the time i did not know what the
data/030076.wav|would you feel the no gift i was like i was like
data/009746.wav|so he can go infiltrate the gang and that would be stupid enough that
data/027950.wav|back to the wins and fails but big win to
data/027391.wav|at the game oh well then we're suing them if it's a
data/013983.wav|in salesman but nothing he said actually made sense if you look into it it was buzzwords and flair so
data/011530.wav|have you seen ludwig's youtube banner
data/006775.wav|he's funnier than my dad we
data/025098.wav|large divisions in the country that cause extreme negative feelings about one brand or the other fox at number two and then number one and i'm surprised by this but this is again this is based on actual customer interviews employee satisfaction detail analytics yeah i mean this
data/022039.wav|is different from the bk tweet
data/027749.wav|pivot towards thinking this stuff is actually cool I don't know
data/015960.wav|and i think i mean even
data/028850.wav|and like a cushion i just steal all these soft things and i build like a big
data/032208.wav|it was we were all gonna
data/007069.wav|if the for pictures pretty much ever like every smash tournament i've gone to before i hang out with like scar and people
data/028594.wav|i was stoked there's scarra at
data/000965.wav|the world tradition that's normal there but
data/014537.wav|well we got our we got a big day
data/024804.wav|is that there's millions of these people sharing their insane luck in polling
data/013872.wav|okay this fail is on arcane last week i talked about
data/026672.wav|just because people are older and more successful than me in the world of business does not mean they are smart
data/020578.wav|in vodka out of her ass how much more time do you need
data/018194.wav|one of the brands you can choose from as a
data/008772.wav|what i'm saying is if they talk to an actual
data/012108.wav|and we have to like on
data/008923.wav|we'll use it can you guys find the twitch shatter
data/003131.wav|if you're trying to join right now
data/018334.wav|not paladin's the video game no not
data/031746.wav|no period after that sentence originally
data/026900.wav|built for the memes featuring kanye
data/005774.wav|this is a real story okay hassan and
data/026783.wav|going to go up if you have to pay them raw salary it becomes very expensive so having your stock go up has a lot of
data/013267.wav|they say conor exposed al capone's tax
data/005266.wav|said that but the second like i think there was a girl in his group that
data/016465.wav|and i wanted to include them thankfully there's some humor ahead we're
data/027017.wav|i was a kid and i know that boomers like the e-trade baby but like the whole
data/023812.wav|setting up a goal that's just brilliant
data/016245.wav|who did some investigative research into the lakers social media i'll i'll let him take it away
data/019916.wav|all these full page ads in every
data/009457.wav|influencer games are even worse than solo queue games not in terms of toxicity but in terms of
data/022506.wav|i think i think that looks really nasty and
data/032365.wav|it at least one of the runs every
data/007008.wav|i was like first of all i don't drink coffee i don't drink coffee that's not i don't drink
data/000448.wav|introduces me to pineapple vodka which i guess is not a crazy
data/020816.wav|exactly a little bit off script
data/027700.wav|bonus it actually is an ethical business
data/016441.wav|people that need to pay for gas as it rises and as the
data/019253.wav|of money for this and then saw it and said let's spend a ton of money for this and then saw it
data/003561.wav|other than me so a lot of them
data/012376.wav|it's not he didn't carry along he was a
data/007205.wav|for this event and so i reached out during the event
data/029716.wav|and i think it was actually kind of dope that that's what the
data/022743.wav|what a half thinking all right

data/005462.wav|because you look scared and you shouldn't in a
data/030140.wav|i think it's part of reason why
data/030644.wav|and they get kicked out so if you get
data/023104.wav|in the five ingredients they don't change the ingredients they send to the stores
data/028178.wav|so i'm interested and i will be following up on this story of face clan's possible implosion but let's just
data/031238.wav|he was the best zerg player in history all right he was just a god of starcraft
data/027150.wav|a recession there's like no way around
data/025998.wav|it's today unfortunately our justice system found elizabeth holmes guilty if you can't drop out of stanford at age
data/026352.wav|stuff has gotten they've clearly stolen a
data/018816.wav|it's crazy and they chose the hooters outfit
data/001278.wav|it is funny that when i was a kid i would watch fear factor with joe rogan and now many years later he's like the biggest
data/015748.wav|we're going to have we're gonna get 300
data/028511.wav|one month's best work or something like
data/025520.wav|again doing extremely well with the
data/008798.wav|and thus yes yes they could um but again the way the financing
data/030389.wav|well i'm like no you're gonna ruin
data/030420.wav|and i'm talking to the receptionist at the hotel francisco he finds
data/001368.wav|i have no incentive to tell me the truth
data/015915.wav|let's get away with uh looking if you
data/009927.wav|one where i said actually unions
data/014856.wav|it was my fail i'm gonna do
data/026431.wav|say in my stream that he will actually read
data/015116.wav|so as hollywood steals everything away from us we
data/015264.wav|they they don't make a ton of money yet and so they can only raise prices if they keep great quality low churn so it depends
data/000269.wav|we all make money everyone's having good we
data/000445.wav|and then we're very hungry we're extremely
data/011017.wav|it's a really technically it's early just live in hawaii and you're fine
data/000172.wav|was a movie dude it was crazy we don't remember got was a movie dude it was crazy we don't remember a goddamn thing
data/013466.wav|thing to do oh my god what it's
data/029365.wav|of the dinner i talked to that comes at the end but either way i'm at the beginning of the dinner i order my food i think he's
data/026700.wav|is in a bad way okay none of their their saved your games diablo 4 overwatch
data/006514.wav|we can actually afford whenever you can split
data/025459.wav|how dope is that graphic design kings and queens out there get on this you could work on dozens of projects and eventually maybe
data/009383.wav|and that's what ninjas should do to i guess
data/003837.wav|at the end of the day i would say a lot of americans actually find both teams to be not aligned with what they want and
data/016839.wav|of a new planet that he can turn into warehouses that is a guarantee
data/022451.wav|text you back you'll never know what color bubbles you
data/027615.wav|direction i think twitter's had no
data/012342.wav|like a margarita kind of thing this is pretty
data/030338.wav|to that this is my dad's
data/021723.wav|we are doing it and then telling us how you
data/027454.wav|as weekend when she literally dropped the
data/012071.wav|would make jokes about how like politics was tearing our our marriage apart
data/011727.wav|okay so this is the outdoors we get to the front of this prison and i'm thinking okay i
data/028358.wav|ash bros that's what i hope
data/017890.wav|in a better brand experience at your touch
data/025762.wav|product also their name dirt devil fits
data/004097.wav|how's your health i'm fine no i don't
data/030635.wav|there's like one of these thin little dk
data/011504.wav|instead of buying a script bought like a high school
data/007731.wav|when the enron hats will ship well i'm having
data/000520.wav|from ludwig and so we go up to the
data/006009.wav|i was like a it was top 32
data/023048.wav|i mean eventually it happened what's
data/003431.wav|i the guy you just saw uh premier g
data/000775.wav|when money like they can win like there's no and it's just one stock that could be
data/005604.wav|yeah yeah so at the after party
data/010866.wav|that's actually awesome dude i would love dude that's actually
data/024394.wav|one takeaway today it's that most of these
data/017336.wav|but the beginning wave is what's fine the problem is once they get all these employees they they wield a lot of political power because they have
data/025951.wav|number of ways in the way they're
data/004788.wav|when he said this and has been aware that twitter had bots there was no
data/001695.wav|the second he gets a golden ticket they dudes up
data/028596.wav|okay so i got quite high but
data/022124.wav|these twitter accounts have no other purpose in the
data/026149.wav|in lighter news but also equally a fail uh you
data/026161.wav|we are still thriving and there was a leak this week that proves that blizzard has exactly what it takes to take back the crown and that's why my win this week is
data/023537.wav|where they're they they price it
data/026114.wav|what concessions for the employees uh
data/027937.wav|the sponsor for today's marketing monday i literally
data/000218.wav|i didn't i mean i didn't i didn't
data/013141.wav|has found it so much easier because they're already good at games they already have games and they can just
data/022500.wav|have been popular enough i think they would
data/017070.wav|at died yeah i know sad
data/026958.wav|at their money's worth uh okay okay now
data/004477.wav|really really really that's i asked
data/014226.wav|that would be watching marketing monday maybe now
data/025862.wav|are you didn't then blizzard did the same
data/026824.wav|five percent of the time i try to talk about talk about
data/016631.wav|well yeah it used to be 70 in the
data/028125.wav|he called like yeah b riley principal 150
data/025425.wav|but convenience store says and then they throw
data/031878.wav|for that world so this is a fake circle for clint sach i wish he had streamed but if
data/031689.wav|i only like um cowboy bebop
data/014484.wav|i would trust what your gut tells you that's what i
data/009247.wav|oh the little do you know
data/005176.wav|i could tell when she started that she actually
data/012810.wav|and then i wouldn't do that great and then he was like
data/025911.wav|is literally hid from the camera and they were all fired including the casters which was absolutely ludicrous extreme extreme
data/016299.wav|let me tell you the three
data/007661.wav|project just hang out with the arkham frogs you know the arkham frogs
data/017969.wav|people i like and physical activity and you know i
data/023902.wav|at yesterday i think it i think this tournament
data/023529.wav|they just make an absolute rack load of money per car and if you look around the at any brand
data/015088.wav|i mean hollywood was like way hey remember that deal we had for friends we are to i mean hollywood was like wait um hey remember that deal we had for
data/001417.wav|wacky yo yo with our blocky
data/010099.wav|if the the panel and below it you get 120 off your
data/011200.wav|what a difference yes sir yes sir
data/025672.wav|got you out of your comfort zone or one that made you feel scared those two things activated the same thing but it turns out you could activate the fear one
data/027165.wav|we afford all of the debts that it owes not just on the national debt but on social security etc is to make the amount they owe worth less so there's it's kind of a
data/014160.wav|incentives to to run a lot of ads get a lot of viewers sell a lot of subs that's
data/004023.wav|seems to be like he's very clear about what he wants and you're the one not reading the signals
data/026868.wav|it doesn't feel too cringe by the way keep this in
data/023588.wav|this one's a little more fun doing something that everybody loves doing
data/000457.wav|i passed the buzz line i'm drunk now it's
data/016833.wav|well that within our lifetimes uh space
data/003890.wav|at this and i think if he runs i
data/021241.wav|if people having fun the answer is dollar signs that's what the rest of the world is starting to see from
data/006323.wav|you think i should get involved
data/010593.wav|it's differences and we could have our one voice unite
data/002192.wav|never work a day in your life and there's
data/010703.wav|you one hundred thousand dollars to quit and buy
data/010564.wav|if anything i'm a good friend because i'm
data/023166.wav|and they add the grill marks fake
data/010401.wav|forced competition and provided a a
data/026317.wav|if they do so they created these um these
data/009043.wav|the trailers yet we can even watch it
data/019980.wav|marvel puts out more than one movie a year pixar at best is doing about one a year marvel's cranking out two three
data/012955.wav|really time consuming and not only does it cost you money but during that time you could probably be working and making money so you're
data/016443.wav|are you know government assistance or relief
data/032294.wav|it but but you know if you put that many hours into some you feel a certain sense of as i think blizzard called it
data/014464.wav|as deals i don't want to comment on those
data/012725.wav|i lived in germany when runescape was big like when it was not
data/013759.wav|for reportedly making oh my god it it
data/008556.wav|you know like profit loss revenue and in that report they say they estimate they have about five percent of their users as bots which is actually a really high number
data/032305.wav|the showed off that i had done something that's possibly even harder i had beaten every single boss in the hall of gods on radiant difficulty
data/019556.wav|if i could interview king delroy
data/008052.wav|glad you're caught up bro hey watch out for
data/000812.wav|it was that go is the worst outcome
data/000356.wav|and apparently i mean it turns out it's
data/012141.wav|and i started to pick all the evil options like the
data/001841.wav|new map stream i did it yesterday i got a world record three times in one day on the new map but
data/012099.wav|it was like an older kind of
data/013382.wav|i experience on every flight recently
data/023504.wav|he spends nothing now this is on
data/020264.wav|we forgot to include anything that reminds you of a product so they just take
data/022187.wav|i've mentioned this before so there's an art to using puppies and dogs in advertisements okay
data/008298.wav|the best mental space you know it's not
data/022788.wav|that's terrible but if you buy a company that
data/001648.wav|put this back there it is it doesn't look happy to be in it but it
data/002757.wav|work uh to get you paid out
data/001999.wav|like those type of quick serve
data/027086.wav|let's just get all that fun stuff out of the way all right we good are we
data/030188.wav|hundred bucks on it and the thing was climbing up that rope is already hard but if somebody next to you doesn't want you to
data/009820.wav|good news american car sales hit five percent
data/022696.wav|if the one hundred million dollars this year and so now the ad sales team at
data/020793.wav|is that no matter how far down
data/031460.wav|appetizers ever and they're like asking preferences and and making it was just going crazy says is mia hanging out appetizers ever and then they're like asking preferences and and making
data/005617.wav|he lied way more than i thought
data/003287.wav|we've been seeing and he's got a good correlation here i'm
data/020762.wav|so many hearts will get crushed so many people's lives have been worked to the bone to try and win this award but only one man or woman did it with the poise and grace and tact necessary to be this marketing monday's man of the year that's why the award goes to travis scott travis scott is the
data/024366.wav|it's expensive ad ever made and it's not
data/029231.wav|what yeah just like stand there and like pull the curtain open and then he walks out onto the stage okay and then
data/029412.wav|paying the bill so like i finish the call i go out there and i just put my check on the thing and i remember i was just so
data/011964.wav|hey are you it feels like you're allied to the first order do you
data/005627.wav|at all since then and he came to me and i don't i
data/030435.wav|with that that i got engaged
data/020163.wav|it's true that the this could only have
data/023354.wav|sustained public pressure and a leak during the epic games trial that
data/009264.wav|i think always great i just thought it felt like
data/010103.wav|so it's easy recommendation for me check them
data/032310.wav|the whole thing was planned ahead of time i had been grinding
data/018943.wav|i ready it's fine dude do you know how long
data/025297.wav|by it it is like a thing that is a requirement to doing business and that mental switch has been huge for netflix because they just don't lose customers they they they mostly just
data/000340.wav|not a big deal not not a big deal not a big deal not a problem but apparently and luckily this was near the end but apparently it
data/008566.wav|actually specifically are not saying any hard numbers they're just saying i'm trying to figure out what's the exact phrase they're using it's it's a very funny phrase because if they say
data/024390.wav|and apparently this short cost almost as much as the
data/004826.wav|and what was even better than that is that immediately following this
data/009770.wav|it's about learning today's about expanding our
data/014448.wav|the recording industry and legal and they're both gonna end up handling
data/030473.wav|it makes sense like it would just i have to do it today i'll be honest with you all right i if i can talk to you know a thousand people
data/030247.wav|the folly of youth i just sat on that
data/008020.wav|like the the real freedom of breath of
data/004088.wav|dream during your lunch break so us est
data/025176.wav|and i don't want my mom to look at it so i softened your
data/031697.wav|we're going to pretend that it's a real
data/029075.wav|i know i know all of those emotes like not that i know what they are but i know what they're coming from too like
data/030599.wav|the first place i'm also banning because you
data/022976.wav|multi i mean apple has more money than epic made off fortnite in their
data/029568.wav|we used to say stuff like we we've kind of made that there's kind of been that narrative for so long but it
data/030296.wav|i love marketing monday and i just get up
data/021911.wav|manually push it basically he talks about you're grinding the flywheel to
data/002244.wav|why doesn't tesla advertise tesla advertises just like anyone else
data/029657.wav|if the was game plan he's like okay okay so yeah
data/015046.wav|it's more and more for netflix to send out these dvds at the same time broadband speeds got less and less expensive and
data/031827.wav|are the big hot tub streamers but i
data/002562.wav|you know how the game goes
data/022965.wav|it's actually just the fortnite company
data/027785.wav|calling at once the real cause here is the following inflation is that all-time highs it's it's spiking and not slowing down because in
data/030330.wav|who knew i would be uh putting
data/023531.wav|they have raised the perceived value so high let me see
data/014030.wav|and is now streaming exclusively on youtube gaming and that means the war has just begun because ludwig is not
data/019501.wav|if you ever wondered why you know like um you'll be watching a
data/005966.wav|the i mean it literally is the reenactment of that
data/018749.wav|at this let everyone know that you had the new file they didn't
data/031452.wav|and for that we respect the king he he returned
data/002815.wav|as to him on his hands and knees at a party begging
data/009006.wav|up the way showing what he was thinking and doing and what he was saying in the text and
data/021758.wav|idiot for sure solidad let's put it up
data/007756.wav|that way he can still be fast in his
data/019747.wav|and then it wrote the song the song
data/011464.wav|check it out and i would check it out in the dark i would like lay down i
data/016960.wav|if you want to transfer any of your current stocks or or money from like a bank to
data/021955.wav|but the unique thing about amazon's
data/020946.wav|make money and then like a month in
data/024786.wav|well for stardust it's all way
data/017411.wav|but if you zoom out on a larger level it's a little bit unfortunate that i you know i don't even have my own picture
data/020810.wav|well today i'm finally doing something meaningful with my time wow
data/019540.wav|do that i am going to have to veto i'm sorry boys your votes are in and i appreciate you putting
data/017993.wav|with oh yeah for sure he actually bought the studio as far as
data/024915.wav|that gotcha games rely on because once you've
data/004496.wav|hey is there any chance you could wish me a happy birthday it's not my birthday but i'll
data/013816.wav|she's again just dominating this console war the console war is making both sides have to make extra money by dumping it on pc so both exclusives are coming to pc pcs
data/022409.wav|they managed to keep their logo front and center for the entire thing it's 60 unbroken seconds of using a
data/009687.wav|or payment locked in probably more than
data/020689.wav|indie game thank god they didn't
data/011568.wav|i got this watch from i watched the movie fracture with ryan gosling
data/007755.wav|that i was the fastest man alive that could smoke usain bolt
data/015999.wav|with the competition once one of them wins or
data/015587.wav|and now as of a few months ago roku bought the entire quibby library
data/030002.wav|with the lifetime of your stream and then in the
data/005309.wav|do it because like you know i don't want i'm
data/019324.wav|well class there was compute you some douchebags there was pear tech
data/019087.wav|at the joke this is funny and i think when they
data/014792.wav|there is a panel below the stream that you can check out we
data/022077.wav|engagement even if they both have no followers an example tweet
data/006556.wav|one thousand dollars that you don't have with buy now pay later you still have to pay i think you're thinking of the buy now
data/002261.wav|i can't believe it you've been following
data/002907.wav|watching in a different home and uh and if you you
data/015639.wav|in the shows on twitch that and star trek fans i actually
data/022677.wav|in dollars for a lot of furry porn that's that's essentially it so
data/001386.wav|like there's not that many more right it
data/017786.wav|and post purchase after you become part of the mango nation
data/008124.wav|it's one of those things i don't need because
data/032061.wav|looked over edited you know make sure
data/032331.wav|there is zero chance he completed whatever had not finished naga forestry with his there is zero chance he completed whatever he had not finished in hog before his
data/008820.wav|and there's a lot of people that believe that if he just goes back to basics and
data/024006.wav|true to the matter is all of the matter is
data/023102.wav|as the red snapper and they now sell it for twenty four dollars a
data/007180.wav|so i messaged him again over a year ago when i saw some highlight clips from a tournament like a small tournament in
data/026581.wav|so much less of a story if you
data/001714.wav|and like have dark thoughts at night read roald dahl's other works read his short stories roald dahl has like oh assets
data/005337.wav|when i was like yeah you get out of
data/024830.wav|you should be able to spend your money over and over and over again on a variety of
data/030208.wav|we're shoddy battle matches so many times that
data/013708.wav|gimme company that's not roblox because roblox
data/013269.wav|i've never heard anyone other than you right now say that
data/027430.wav|affordable housing we shouldn't have rent control
data/013436.wav|that sounds cool as hell god damn i love
data/030336.wav|yeah this is this is like
data/029366.wav|no problem then the middle of the
data/002055.wav|somebody heard it she basically said that she changed her dating app to say i
data/002964.wav|yeah dude everyone knows the name sierra 6.
data/021908.wav|it started the most important thing about a flywheel
data/024871.wav|that is the idea that people are more afraid of losses people hate losing more than they love winning i explained
data/021973.wav|and i think this is the right lesson i'm just not sure that jeff bezos really took it his grandfather told him jeff one day
data/027635.wav|so i was wondering how did he get this money like how did he how did he get the
data/032404.wav|in freak out and then you give it twice
data/021402.wav|what a bunch some smart guys bought a bunch and wall street bets picked up on that and they started looking into it and they started realizing this thing is so over shorted there are so many
data/008329.wav|put some vaseline on it to blur the edges
data/003760.wav|i have to get rid of that
data/025345.wav|well i got this guy i stole this from the set
data/017944.wav|screens is a big part of food brand value in general you know
data/004930.wav|if done that so today i mean even with the deal being considered a go until today this stock has been worth
data/008227.wav|into recession this is the best case scenario by
data/013916.wav|i don't know how many of you guys know about this but i'm sure based on demographics a lot of you do are you aware in my chat of an app called klarna who here knows about klarna
data/022464.wav|and the air max souls makes it easier to begin your jogging journey they just associate their brand with the beginning of a
data/025485.wav|i think the current stock market is at
data/026486.wav|already learned this lesson so they wasted a absolutely absurd amount of money
data/000823.wav|during today's stream i will think of other
data/001600.wav|like people have been trying them and enjoying them and i think i think if it's not a fight like if it's within what makes sense for your finances um i
data/028214.wav|oh you liked brood war oh you
data/025966.wav|they would say hey we don't pay more than anyone else but
data/021790.wav|it's a nice break from all the other
data/026698.wav|they lose all of the viewers of course because it's on youtube now it goes down like
data/014158.wav|courage resigns okay they start go over to youtube
data/022140.wav|my keyboard and then i wrote the whole tweet and then it was late did he put the
data/015813.wav|i guarantee that netflix disney amazon they've all thought about paying an influencer to make a show it can be cheap
data/022223.wav|at right i thought it was strong i mean i
data/020038.wav|with doubleclick is in case you're like
data/023826.wav|hell yeah said i'm not leaving without a
data/003081.wav|they were just having a lot more economic troubles inflation's
data/019761.wav|well a little bit before we begin about why this stuff happens it's
data/021500.wav|back to zero this is not going to
data/013739.wav|in lighter news but also equally a fail
data/030859.wav|i remember the good times just give me give me tier three i'll
data/008761.wav|my twitter bid succeeds we will defeat the
data/005374.wav|i was waving at you and then he starts telling everyone around the worst possible outcome he starts telling everyone around dude i was waving at this guy and he keeps
data/015166.wav|dollars to make which again is within mr beast but in fact i think mr beast probably spent more on his squid game per episode

data/022432.wav|i mean it was like cutting to the core of branding they were just like these guys are nerds and losers and we're
data/016207.wav|he's got a sick only fans
data/023306.wav|wait no one really cared and it faded instantly and it was
data/026717.wav|what access to the great ip okay there's there's starcraft
data/014302.wav|if you are even even an affiliate even small streamers can pick up a significant portion of their income from primes
data/028656.wav|you want to look around you want
data/019507.wav|if the throughout you know it's talking about
data/019143.wav|or in person the top comment the tough comment at
data/015177.wav|paramount they're all bidding the same content in hollywood okay
data/020089.wav|we've pretty well it goes public and it's worth a billion dollars and he realizes he's not cut out currently at his age he's not cut out to be ceo so he goes to pepsi and he tells the ceo
data/011593.wav|be watching the end of this show if they
data/017825.wav|learning a lot about amd drivers right now let me tell you i am not happy about them that is the post purchase experience it is one of the things i think nvidia has over invested in and it's made a big difference
data/028001.wav|if they paid a lot of money for they paid many many billions to acquire
data/003510.wav|considering that you studied this more than us do you think about
data/001245.wav|what would you do if you saw me on your shelf and i looked at you
data/020174.wav|it's still up obviously deleted that is so
data/026747.wav|more question people asked a lot because
data/027951.wav|in the public let's go to a fail now that of
data/009743.wav|john travolta is an undercover cop who wants to like infiltrate a gang so they they arrest the leader of the gang and then surgically cut his face off
data/024204.wav|how much it actually hurts let it happen and if it does hurt then they'll spend government big bucks if connor leaves it's over for twitch of connor leaves twitch twitch they how much it actually hurts to let it happen and if it does hurt then they'll spend they'll spend big bucks if conor leaves
data/019959.wav|it's office that captured the imagination of kids everywhere that were selling a ton of merch these movies had cult followings but they didn't do the same and
data/026335.wav|it conveys that they're worth the price tag second thing on the purchase part of the
data/000651.wav|i think even though we weren't youtube ballers i guess i mean i
data/026235.wav|and it's a big problem and so i just want to make sure that this branding does not fool you these things are essentially debt on training wheels credit cards they will give you as much money as possible and lock you into
data/027026.wav|what are the most lazy budweiser ads i've ever seen
data/028419.wav|he became a colonel and a commander and uh he

data/028006.wav|as improving rapidly because they see the
data/005004.wav|the the retaining talent so those are three outcomes i don't know which way it'll go i honestly don't i think in a normal world based on how things have normally gone and on the spirit of the law the more i've looked into it the more it's like pretty obvious he just made a bad call he made a bad business move but he signed on the dotted line and
data/012197.wav|anyway she does she just lets

data/019652.wav|at the one and only sweet i see
data/019557.wav|it just hear what was going on in his life when he created the autozone
data/011545.wav|multi pleasure media and uh pretending that any one of them
data/009003.wav|so it's kind of it was an
data/024835.wav|the meta in some way so that different characters are more valuable so that somebody that says has a perfect
data/030731.wav|the fiance's name okay i'm sensing a pattern yeah you got that one ari i think
data/020492.wav|and i think that about covers everything they've made up to cyberpunk i don't know if you're seeing a pattern but this has become one of the most valuable game companies on planet earth one of the most respected game companies on planet earth all off of one
data/000560.wav|we're all doing great and on sunday we have these new watches
data/026483.wav|unfortunately what they did not understand is that buying a book does not give you the rights to the intellectual property i have purchased all
data/016692.wav|the first released the first people that made the simplest apps like fruit ninja made
data/011920.wav|about just doing luxury stuff it's like about a
data/026201.wav|i that's what everyone tells me i had to
data/021622.wav|up until up until this point i'm really on board
data/016582.wav|blowing up it's doing incredibly well
data/029811.wav|full of play of everyone else is so good yeah i just bobby i i just want you to know like because i
data/017397.wav|at for clickbait if any clip gets popular anywhere and so
data/014911.wav|he must have made a lot of money off
data/018106.wav|well like it i'm not having fun
data/027197.wav|invest in stocks crypto anything anything
data/010497.wav|i thought the movie was like it tried to wrap up
data/001858.wav|in two weeks of back and forth
data/022734.wav|the fired money lost left and right no phone
data/024671.wav|sorry brother anyone who tells you they know
data/000383.wav|it specifically i remember we were at a table we learned a brand new game called
data/027368.wav|it tells me they understand it so he said we're always looking to improve but in our game specifically hardship is what gives meaning to the experience so it's not something we're willing to abandon at the moment it is our identity and i think when you think about that
data/026051.wav|and unfolds over the next decades the pipeline is there and ready but kids are gonna need tech education because alexa this is real this is actually i thought
data/024177.wav|youtube is is playing a game here where they want to get a lot of people they're
data/012619.wav|is there were like talking about galaxies they were like talking about galaxies
data/011662.wav|and more importantly if i talk about
data/007679.wav|it's a big win got a
data/004151.wav|this side of it i'm like bro i don't want to do that
data/028291.wav|and he has no concept of decorum so let me give
data/013580.wav|i have to keep in touch with these things i
data/022062.wav|i can't wait to get out of this stub sucking
data/005757.wav|and then he just sat back down he's like no i wasn't leaving i just
data/020532.wav|i'm worried about what do you see here this is
data/016041.wav|i might not be live for a few days because i
data/011592.wav|kinda wish they just didn't use it and then i saw then i saw a tweet and the tweet was like
data/014582.wav|it's of dollars here and they're not worried about looking like they're
data/029250.wav|i tim a a dash j and that double
data/017197.wav|i i'm pretty much fully recovered i i don't think i have any lingering effect i
data/031515.wav|in a point and then we send another guy and
data/013065.wav|his business lived or died based on knowing it
data/022152.wav|no you're wrong but really you're mostly right but
data/003316.wav|i'm actually being serious for a second not
data/008846.wav|if he's got that maybe but he has shown no evidence that
data/015186.wav|this is how much they're spending next year okay nobody
data/003576.wav|if i ignore it it won't it won't exist i like the idea of like
data/012307.wav|now i'm sort of like able to play
data/031395.wav|six good signatures from nvidia i
data/016773.wav|if the for our demographics so
data/015068.wav|we didn't didn't know the value
data/006545.wav|the loan sharking and debt to average people has always been a very profitable
data/021676.wav|where's the cringe you're giving somebody adds
data/003376.wav|during the moscow open yeah during the moscow open yeah i think there is a let me find the video
data/026839.wav|a lot a lot of crypto you
data/007064.wav|the amount like five minutes ago so rewatch it you know
data/019674.wav|the first one did well and you
data/000102.wav|i get to a year you didn't make it you didn't make it i
data/010847.wav|who's the most cringed champ it's false
data/020356.wav|i can fit the bikes in the back i did that one time literally one time if i actually put the bike in
data/016254.wav|into score tweet from the laker social media
data/028308.wav|he you know dj wheat's an icon
data/013338.wav|one package of every kind of oreo you know the double stuff the triple
data/001619.wav|well and chicken nuggets and then you add one factor meal that's not
data/026158.wav|i just a week ago uh if you
data/020255.wav|we're all a little more likely to think
data/026405.wav|then having again a better advertisement
data/022592.wav|you get a totally immersive experience
data/022623.wav|he they were looking for someone to be the role that i wrote for angry gamer
data/004111.wav|you know and then okay so
data/012929.wav|we do social media well instead of
data/031109.wav|it's one of those things where luck meets opportunity right like if
data/028958.wav|on a trip to japan or they
data/003434.wav|later this year i think in october and at that point he's going to push for an unprecedented third term usually they sit down after two and once
data/024806.wav|and guilty of this i have spent hundreds of dollars before i had any back when i was
data/016072.wav|because i don't even know what that means
data/025819.wav|this is in my mind far and away the best video game film or tv adaptation ever having seen i think all of them oh yeah
data/010203.wav|for it is it is i
data/002592.wav|simple question with a simple answer give me head
data/029831.wav|in the video for you i
data/013248.wav|that kind of connections around twitch you don't want to get yeah you don't want
data/003429.wav|one china policy we don't talk about it and we don't really push it they don't push it and nothing happens and
data/022380.wav|it's probably less scary to jump from this height than lower if you're this far up it just
data/015646.wav|so again they are also in trouble peacock and paramount plus are both in deep trouble going on almost the full
data/012380.wav|and for the big finale which is like the end of saturday night that's like because sunday was only half day and
data/015589.wav|watch chance the rapper's punk show outside of risky reels which was until until recently the only place you could watch it you can finally get roku tv and watch it now i still think they've probably overpaid
data/000325.wav|it's like you have an actual gun and you can move it was pretty sick it was it was like one of the better vr experience i've ever done because it feels really cool
data/015321.wav|and you're using one day shipping that is important to them and they'll give you
data/011970.wav|it's like do good things and then there's the first order who
data/001699.wav|the triple shifting at the laundromat and then the second the kid comes home with
data/026921.wav|would have been a little odd right to include a scene in the middle of a
data/032276.wav|so we get the entire crew and it becomes like this story it's like for slime we're
data/027961.wav|go on is the movie event of the millennium and so director louis
data/000561.wav|we've got tons of money in our pocket we got great food we had a great night everything is good and then we get a call from the the vegas promoter who hooked
data/004419.wav|rub daddy and did the pitch saw my stream or the video reached out to me and wants to be on the broadcast which is awesome which is really really cool
data/018747.wav|spending less money on the phone and from the back no one could tell it was the new one you couldn't flex okay and so apple solved this problem with this
data/005976.wav|i knew he was like i've played melee with
data/003769.wav|i think is the root of every major problem and
data/008601.wav|that like helped their case in the
data/027294.wav|it's a rite of passage in a way
data/013179.wav|i can't show it on stream i'll
data/003841.wav|if the to appeal the values that hit bull
data/024499.wav|sorry it's not close epic games got
data/029605.wav|there are no one if you're not even if you're
data/006235.wav|millions millions that is another thing that's that's the problem because you're not sponsored the millions millions that is another thing that's that's the problem because you're not sponsored to play so you're not getting any money
data/025870.wav|that is like a 2002 way
data/011831.wav|it's a big star wars fan and we needed a two day
data/017727.wav|and beyond the clock that people don't think of as much but they have a much bigger impact than spending extra money on tv advertisements these things have done more to market the product than that
data/032046.wav|know that i've seen his set
data/000588.wav|everyone's incredibly gifted and so right before we go in
data/024554.wav|if the thing apple is going to appeal this i
data/032429.wav|so i hope you take the lesson from this
data/001050.wav|while the old had to remember when we did dota
data/005241.wav|you know no big deal and i
data/015010.wav|it competitors all with billions of dollars and tons of content are showing up to the battlefield first up we have the lion we have the
data/009697.wav|is as easy to flow off the tongue as it was
data/006217.wav|if i don't make it by tuesday i always
data/028929.wav|last thing i remember is i wake up i wake up
data/016932.wav|this possible by the way even if you're not going to work in any one of those industries you can still see price appreciation and value appreciation by investing in those industries that's
data/020681.wav|in the chat i'm seeing among us in the chat you're all close but this award goes to
data/018157.wav|is that what you want do you want
data/030874.wav|are you high this time you
data/026003.wav|your fake blood testing nationwide deliver everybody false positives like false positive hiv false positive cancer false positive for a miscarriage and then if you can't do all that without going to jail what happened to this country
data/031932.wav|work kind of making fun of it to be honest and as we're getting close and this i didn't really know i
data/004961.wav|and i'm very glad that i sold when i did
data/021907.wav|i think about this flywheel and if i get
data/022189.wav|the advertising brand that has figured it out the art the most
data/032160.wav|why money if a 12 comes up so those
data/005987.wav|at the game pops off he
data/005616.wav|i do apologizing for it uh understandably
data/022688.wav|we don't get it we know you guys you tumblr you guys are hip we're going
data/014658.wav|i work in supply chain and i would love to know how marketing factors and issues other than business functions in other business functions

data/028992.wav|the carson beats me in a fight in hand-to-hand combat listen i'm not the biggest
data/028968.wav|ways i can get a pl
data/012721.wav|you know of my youth one summer was lost and my people lost way more than that i got out only because i got into something else i

data/008429.wav|suspicious message from the veil i created
data/002932.wav|not one and it just it was kind of mid it
data/012249.wav|walking around the ship there's always some stuff happening what was really cool was that the actors would talk to each other even if nobody was around i saw this on multiple occasions where you'd walk in and you could hear they stayed in character talking to each other so like you could seamlessly join a situation like like you'd walk into like around
data/006840.wav|fucking gets a regular when i'm watching you
data/028119.wav|it on the nasdaq you could go into your app and trade phase stock that was the
data/020530.wav|i guarantee it they'll do everything that kind of chug away this game until i guarantee it they'll do everything they can to
data/032263.wav|i called into the gambling gods i don't

data/002081.wav|state your hands and you could say oh it's i got i got a i got the
data/026513.wav|some of the more egregious crypto ideas comes from gamers
data/021975.wav|be clever now jeff bezos likes doing hard things i don't think he ever decided to do that the last thing i have here is his piece
data/005451.wav|jean jacket from target this is totally that's a discord shirt
data/003588.wav|it's like the great reset in the ryan
data/026748.wav|because people don't necessarily follow this stuff why

data/008770.wav|of battle elon musk may have to complete the the experts say you know a lot lot of stuff lot i basically every different source i'm saying is if they talked of battle elon musk may have to complete the legal experts say uh you know a lot a lot of stuff
data/024546.wav|keep our platform strong and like pay
data/000162.wav|really funny but we move on because he's a little bit
data/024774.wav|and they said quote they only think of
data/021483.wav|but the thing is these short sellers the contracts they have all had the stock at like
data/028536.wav|it's a place called tax ninja dude it was and i emailed tax ninja and i remember i didn't know what to say
data/029336.wav|the loser like i'm just not i'm not coming
data/025722.wav|well i'll be honest with you so what i'm seeing
data/013690.wav|the and engineers in a giant office expensive in san francisco and adds no features the biggest thing they've added is like a
data/005403.wav|are doing it but i don't want to put any work
data/025560.wav|the were immediately quitting because they found out how
data/023289.wav|and it was required that during all interviews two bottles of coke be placed on the stage next people as they're being interviewed
data/031216.wav|campaign slogan i forgot exactly what it was but i remember it was stupid and the kids that were voting thought it was funny and liked it so i knew
data/023259.wav|i told you that all of these waters came from the same garden hose
data/031547.wav|putting their base and you do a bunch of damage he built it he dropped
data/030564.wav|is that you kissing her it doesn't even look like you that's me
data/023959.wav|people think it's bad so it doesn't work maybe canada has found a way to turn
data/016512.wav|i like a shirtless jeff bezos on his yacht in
data/030922.wav|the main reason i'm losing actually is the
data/018402.wav|what you gloss so quickly i wanted to see
data/029174.wav|like a third of the entire website was twitch pokemon
data/023671.wav|in the drywall won't stop screaming at us i
data/005705.wav|but we actually got to talk
data/026271.wav|look at it this is how much apple spent on advertising less than a billion dollars versus samsung
data/027850.wav|if there's entertainment oh man that's that's
data/017529.wav|we'll think of marketing a lot they only think of commercials what is marketing outside of commercials okay what is what are the other aspects of marketing that help build a company's brand other than just
data/004211.wav|just a minute probably in three minutes we're
data/021372.wav|i'm going to give you this stock
data/002335.wav|same old nothing new hot tubs times
data/022344.wav|and it made me think of all different ways you can use social media that's not boring another thing about this is like
data/004500.wav|yeah good i got a better idea
data/013130.wav|working meetings was there anything worth talking about ipso facto r e
data/003149.wav|let me get a nice picture of sad zuckerberg oh yeah now that's a sad zuckerberg oh yeah yeah this is a good
data/008621.wav|which might be the greatest outcome of
data/018161.wav|it was really testing me as a man i'm
data/005042.wav|of money from burger king this is actually
data/003432.wav|gets re-elected to a third term i
data/007047.wav|say happy birthday king happy birthday pingu
data/004461.wav|in the world created by george

data/012806.wav|and and you know i i was doing all right and when i was on this team you know i
data/015093.wav|at once okay all of hollywood started waking up and saying hey you better pay us like
data/030226.wav|two different races there's a different race where there was a ground slide contention where i made it to the bottom of the slide and he touched the ground first that i think will go down in history as one of the great debates of all time the the pace yourself story was just a pure win by him and i i give him credit
data/005329.wav|you can just watch the four seats
data/004268.wav|don't worry about it don't ask
data/027570.wav|with all that brewing i think twitter
data/002152.wav|i am not in conservative video
data/005470.wav|the to jump cut i was at fourth of july with my family i went to see my family my
data/026504.wav|this week the big one was troy baker who's like a very very beloved voice actor who said
data/014867.wav|with everything we love is gonna

data/015081.wav|people still use dvd rentals dvd rentals were still
data/020329.wav|five as in a perfect ad i do not think this

data/007551.wav|over and over come phantom yeah yeah
data/030086.wav|is are like busy the day it
data/016128.wav|thank you for supporting and uh and i'm
data/032177.wav|with chair eight times okay now this is where either the worst or the best thing happened to
data/010524.wav|well we'll talk about it you know it's
data/002496.wav|deus ex invisible war the game itself is pretty cheeks it's pretty bad like it's
data/018694.wav|generously i believe about this much as a company let me let me let me explain why i'm talking about this okay microsoft as a
data/016483.wav|well you know he wasn't a millionaire he wasn't uh
data/012401.wav|the the die they warned us that like if the red alarm goes off it's part of the immersion because otherwise you'd be
data/021691.wav|is more proof to me that i'm right
data/032190.wav|if the the phoenix suns because my
data/019779.wav|they lied they openly lied dude they
data/001377.wav|if people are truth tellers around here
data/023973.wav|it's got fitness stuff it's got cooking stuff it's got comedy stuff and most importantly it's got no users
data/027373.wav|with a company taking home a rare double trophy win and a
data/022137.wav|i to write them get them approved by like always different teams and then set up the sending it was it was really terrible it's a it was not a fun job and i was tired and i was i to write them get them approved by like all these different teams and then set up descending it was it was really
data/007491.wav|hold up a big circular plate i i really don't know what it was why are those balls named the same thing
data/006110.wav|okay he pops off all the time and so if he popped off this hard for a
data/027526.wav|what's the equivalent to tesla they spend 625
data/007089.wav|or character okay people generally don't like chic players and in the history of melee all the way back to the beginning at least like since ken you know since
data/010509.wav|not all the fans right i mean you
data/016415.wav|benefits extremely because what happens is let's say there's a let's say there's only a million dollars in existence and they print four million
data/021332.wav|it's a human response to ever increasing isolation people need to belong in a group they need some kind of human connection and i think i think we're in an era of of really extreme profound loneliness so and also
data/020384.wav|they're making fun of nostalgia and commercials and they do it and then they
data/027312.wav|they benefit from brand wise but isn't
data/022433.wav|to you and these guys are cool and young and
data/007168.wav|soft you know open but i do think that
data/000332.wav|anyway anyway it's it's it's fun it's
data/019576.wav|the wouldn't be fair cause that chocolate
data/026066.wav|this is the last 10 years they've gone
data/006981.wav|anyway it's about to be sincerely it was it was sincerely painful
data/012745.wav|is that you the legendary number one in
data/017013.wav|i haven't seen it i'll watch it literally
data/009322.wav|and i met a lot of
data/000012.wav|i think he just looks only at me and everyone else
data/004037.wav|it should be on the vaude channel
data/016043.wav|real ones remember real ones no i did a family stream back
data/015262.wav|then eventually this debt is going to catch up with them because they're not

data/029698.wav|wang friendlies and i was i was like taking some
data/021368.wav|this is ludwig stock wow he is worth a lot of money he's probably
data/019832.wav|but you probably won't be shocked that this
data/007460.wav|what what odds would you give it though like
data/013492.wav|she wouldn't have said yes to marry me there's no
data/023670.wav|they have no excuse for not responding
data/017460.wav|at the great success despite kellogg's going through

data/014841.wav|it was hotly anticipated and then they announced
data/031342.wav|and my dad is there and instead of yelling at me for a day he took the whole day and he took me to things to get my mind off of it he took me to the coca-cola headquarters museum
data/012580.wav|the problem is this thing doesn't expect you to have more than like three referral stocks so you can't mass do them
data/004900.wav|and you become a member of the board but
data/011947.wav|his name lieutenant croy here by the way i
data/031514.wav|it's like you send out a guy and

data/016459.wav|i don't know his last name but wayne offbeat also by the way
data/031975.wav|we might not know this but ludwig actually used to run and this is how i think this is kind of how you sort of start in the community
data/008246.wav|and living off of jimmy john's and living off of carl's jr and helped me get a
data/017884.wav|i think purchase and post purchase are the
data/016439.wav|it of course would be a
data/028685.wav|talked about it on chameleon day and we got a
data/006051.wav|you know what i'm saying it's like it sounds it's crazy it's it's
data/027359.wav|with the related for from software i think the brand essence is that
data/022750.wav|in two years on a bunch of shitty phones that didn't sell and that is why it is in my top
data/023398.wav|brother you've got a future in marketing
data/024505.wav|i have everything they sold every v buck sold
data/020168.wav|their latest product a new belt or
data/000329.wav|actually moving up but like in the game you stand in a square and it feels like you're moving up
data/011617.wav|so i thought all i have is basically the weekend i have like friday
data/003004.wav|what we have to go like she can see something and then when she does that everyone it was like a pin drop everyone sees her and they freak out they fr right
data/010081.wav|it easy i think if you're
data/009801.wav|yo chemicals and glass in germany could
data/018481.wav|if the pasta straight from chef ari
data/007115.wav|it has been delivering me game of thrones
data/009140.wav|the video and then i released this one after
data/014526.wav|competition breeds excellence and that's exactly what's happening here that's not a trump quote
data/012392.wav|so it's the final day and we've done
data/027744.wav|hatred of Apple they don't like that
data/012426.wav|wait first of all here's the
data/014129.wav|mixer was still small it didn't change anything
data/016201.wav|it was like it's like it's like a
data/018879.wav|if the beginning of the ad were real problems that a kid
data/012364.wav|like we had to go to the bar at
data/018255.wav|animals always a good way to get some
data/009501.wav|some of the best skill expression on the champion and that was really nice
data/031793.wav|it was like the normie group
data/014163.wav|it's like hey we'll give you a better
data/028179.wav|just say all things are not phased up
data/014931.wav|to marketing monday on a wednesday today's topic the streaming wars and i'm not talking about the ones where youtube buys ludwig or dr disrespect gets banned i'm talking about the ones that are about
data/018095.wav|no time for women only time for pepsi
data/023862.wav|an attempt to get people to talk about coke zero sugar the truth is if they hadn't changed the formula and just rebranded this wouldn't get as much discussion and people now want to try the flavors they want to have a stance they want to say what's best the whole thing to me feels a little more calculated this time around wait i gotta go
data/024682.wav|in millions if i bought a million shares
data/009784.wav|is collapsing but germany being in bad economic times has never
data/015635.wav|as long as nathan stands wants to scam the world by watching survivor episodes live on twitch openly
data/021946.wav|i was in a meeting at twitch and i was
data/004773.wav|one thousand dollars a share but immediately after announcing this acquisition
data/015991.wav|fifty bucks a month i am getting like
data/030310.wav|okay because i was equal to the best man in
data/009240.wav|thank you for the uh couple months we're
data/032279.wav|one last try everyone rejoins as we walk through
data/009073.wav|i love you hello how are things in
data/007002.wav|but i also got people coming up to me and handing me things and one guy when i was at the when i was
data/019450.wav|see before but it's really important most people seem to think that if an ad doesn't get you to buy the thing immediately then it has failed if i watch a car ad and i don't go buy a car that ad failed
data/007699.wav|put you in a box and you're
data/025959.wav|when you're when your company has such
data/026749.wav|there is no world where microsoft
data/012228.wav|of me thinks about it he looks at me thinks about it he looks at me he
data/007379.wav|like that was the easiest way to know mango being
data/024216.wav|what the marketing monday and the marketing
data/006893.wav|with the maker that i used religiously
data/027999.wav|and a surprising first of the
data/015903.wav|if you feel like you have to have every piece of content from every platform
data/023496.wav|e limits their sales they try to keep a few amount of cars going out because if there's too many ferraris if their
data/009381.wav|one hundred percent it works every time without fail
data/001028.wav|like they just found out about it there's like a hyundai plant where they're just processing sheet metal with like 12 and
data/006467.wav|okay that consumers were not ready to spend
data/027300.wav|in the media so when a big thing comes out that we can all sort of
data/012870.wav|i didn't do the intro i didn't do the
data/031586.wav|it was like that it was everything on
data/015115.wav|figure it out streaming but we don't own anything
data/030619.wav|and then i got to the house in germany and i plugged in my
data/010896.wav|we're all company hello fresh and minions have partnered up for what is called
data/028777.wav|it will probably wouldn't even give me the job i was making so little that like they would think i'm not serious
data/011856.wav|the bunk bed for no real reason
data/021827.wav|well dragon hoarding amount of wealth that i do not support so if i highlight a few things that i think he's done right or has good ideas on that should not be considered a
data/025707.wav|well lit and delicious and have good food inside and he
data/020769.wav|love the brands love every single one of
data/014128.wav|ninja and the numbers didn't go up
data/016563.wav|what people earn by about 10x
data/002571.wav|very awkward okay but now i don't want to do a pity
data/003421.wav|will china is trying to isolate them and downplay it in preparation for
data/007655.wav|and then i'll finally reveal that video we just
data/009104.wav|cream in the middle of the book
data/030847.wav|it's a video it was it was in my most recent
data/030559.wav|but as i said i told the story out of
data/025603.wav|on valley explosion were facebook amazon apple netflix
data/006459.wav|it's already been discussed to death in the world of gaming industry nobody no gaming publisher is going to
data/015084.wav|we're getting both in one and they left netflix and
data/007468.wav|we're at a place called original joe's which is
data/009187.wav|cause i upload almost every day so it's pretty
data/025251.wav|mario movie and i will just play my new
data/020058.wav|youtube was its own company it
data/026179.wav|and you were like who are these people who are these absolute peanut brain idiots science has figured out who it was
data/032428.wav|and the horse you rode in on bro i don't grind for nothing and i know you're a viewer because you literally have watched every single one of my vods apparently
data/007761.wav|the the shower i put on my public hoodie i didn't put on
data/030047.wav|stanford thing yeah the stanford prison experiment you know what that one was right where they gave the students power and the other students were prisoners and it turns out
data/011905.wav|it added to the immersion so
data/007160.wav|everyone's got and also different parts
data/007075.wav|what you gotta take it while
data/024489.wav|be on the side of trillion dollar apple or on
data/011552.wav|with reason and with logic okay and maybe you
data/017796.wav|want to keep it going and then finally he competes
data/008382.wav|because i want to do today obviously i want to talk about what the
data/005261.wav|you know something like he's just saying
data/012807.wav|it was really good at like
data/010168.wav|at the first three times like it didn't do anything right like like
data/019888.wav|but this person said it it's
data/013426.wav|if you are a bigger five nights at freddy's fan and you want
data/006251.wav|if the thing i guess this is it
data/001819.wav|but visionaries is like it's too
data/026782.wav|api to take because they know it's going to
data/027851.wav|we we get to learn from it right yeah it is entertaining especially when this guy's
data/002645.wav|some someone the next person will win something you will be the house i will be the player this is how we're gonna
data/029616.wav|i feel like what i feel like both of what you're saying i i see both of what you're saying
data/026630.wav|on hand to all cash buy
data/028587.wav|are you ready to be shocked and
data/009135.wav|i literally said that and then
data/017258.wav|this is a fail america let's get our priorities straight okay
data/000927.wav|what do you want you want twenty
data/005743.wav|it's almost like he was built in a lab to be a good just chatting streamer he
data/004684.wav|that it's almost an advantage then it's almost an advantage
data/012950.wav|is it worth doing marketing postgrad in
data/029690.wav|for him if i win you go to evo
data/017775.wav|does sound effect when a sub because i think
data/001288.wav|that's good you know what though i think i mean literally i'm
data/000990.wav|it seems to have a birthday all the time it's like what when did that become a thing
data/008354.wav|but the problem is biden was going to go
data/020389.wav|i have notes or like i have
data/010552.wav|the through it league of legends is an addiction and it's
data/022952.wav|read some of the more recent emails
data/006279.wav|evan gao is auctioning off that poster of my dad that
data/003551.wav|i don't like it personally this is my opinion but i understand it and i don't try to like shut it down i just don't
data/020322.wav|well he drinks it i mean he disappears he disappears into the role
data/013815.wav|so the real winner here is
data/016569.wav|the system there's never been a better time
data/013530.wav|she would wax me in brawl yeah she was she she would wax me
data/023716.wav|that's good that's clever that one
data/031240.wav|and the hotel they had us stay at
data/020538.wav|which bulk of their interest and fan excitement in the first week and they've blown their first week
data/002957.wav|with the conversation which is like wow so it's not a great look for their first big pivot into into the new style of
data/028941.wav|six months i lived there but i
data/016223.wav|i think let me get my song ready here
data/024879.wav|actually think it's worth they all said five bucks seven bucks ten bucks once they
data/013631.wav|if the these wars so we're talking about actual streaming wars so we're talking about
data/004064.wav|it really depressing robert stack unsolved oh it's like a show unsolved
data/021007.wav|i hope this guy got fired i pray this man was fired oh money you spent on this was a waste
data/005157.wav|she did as good a job as she could do i think based on also
data/012337.wav|if the the grabbers for you and it's like
data/029057.wav|and he gets in his car and he drives away and that that moment i realized he was
data/025883.wav|look at this face by the way this is the face of a man who's got a phone both of these companies had
data/003265.wav|well stock you just walking up to the counter at
data/013607.wav|well he's like no i got
data/015532.wav|technically it's worth it okay because if you like ted lasso and it keeps
data/007281.wav|he was yeah it was incredibly hyped so
data/001187.wav|worth checking out the panel's in the link
data/010794.wav|ironic i think i think they could get
data/019103.wav|which is exactly why we have to talk about it it's a tough conversation but i'm glad we're having it
data/016368.wav|wanting to prosecutors he had none
data/019328.wav|at the eric literally barely even show up to class dude eric
data/022494.wav|if the video that i wrote and starred in uh for
data/024565.wav|hard to enforce it would take like you know a big team that apple doesn't want to spend and like a lot of auditors and
data/018624.wav|in all the investors were like whoa you're spending two billion dollars on
data/000227.wav|again we we have you know big ideas together this group and
data/006068.wav|what the games he wants to get better at the games he's always laid back
data/007305.wav|these are all the children back there that i was farming for cash and
data/001547.wav|hello yeah hello hi hi do you want to do a quiz question for
data/013964.wav|the disadvantage is that for that privilege of putting you on training wheels they
data/010016.wav|it's in the very video we're talking about yes i did i
data/012921.wav|and like what does that mean for money like
data/009066.wav|maybe it's this oh yeah yeah yeah wait no there
data/014567.wav|chunks and it works all weird why is it
data/028529.wav|so i go it's by the way it's like the end of tax season this was for previous years taxes but
data/013341.wav|in our main cupboard i put them in the bottom cupboard and i ate a couple of the first box of regular oreos and then i forgot about them and that marketing monday idea for six months and then all the oreos were uh soggy and
data/015645.wav|when streaming war and that's not big enough to justify the cost of operating service
data/019419.wav|in a few seconds right after you get some water
data/006549.wav|and then it's a fail and i hope that people um
data/005581.wav|and every single person comes back later and they're like
data/010692.wav|that's i don't i don't like actively not care it's not like
data/020966.wav|well hello hello hello hello today is marketing monday we have a good topic for you today it's not the one that you expect but it's one you'll
data/019046.wav|it wouldn't change your interaction i'm
data/023660.wav|i put up zero dollars and made 129
data/014253.wav|and we can handle it but i think what they don't realize
data/012040.wav|so powerful in the force so he turns it off
data/018498.wav|this is a flex this is
data/012673.wav|i wonder if i should play it i think the problem is i have to play
data/007749.wav|get a foot race back when he had like
data/000671.wav|and this happened again and again and again and again and again and again and
data/024760.wav|in a billion dollars in like its first year of play what makes it a gotcha
data/024100.wav|the fail let me give a fail to every other
data/031358.wav|what you might as well like your life's
data/009177.wav|at all those streamers and hung out with
data/013236.wav|have you seen episode six of book of boba
data/023927.wav|he could he's using his face he
data/028787.wav|but i get through it i get through it
data/005934.wav|at typing up this is the
data/032180.wav|it's saturday the accountants of the palazzo casino will remember bloody saturday for days to come because i came back swinging i took out fifteen hundred dollars and i came back
data/004885.wav|what the companies do not apply to him and especially with the twitter thing it seems like he feels like the law and contract law does not apply to him and he may be right listen
data/026594.wav|ninja oh let me give you a win okay
data/023478.wav|and through advertising that's why they spend the most of
data/022989.wav|it was the very beginning of the app store and they found this email where an apple executive was talking about hey look at this some games are starting to have a healthy
data/021757.wav|all i want to do is say hey
data/016246.wav|with the graphic to tell the rest of the fans if
data/024090.wav|this could work pretty well and again
data/018992.wav|i mean and quickly within six months
data/012517.wav|his first year or whatever and they're
data/000527.wav|with the piano and there's three boxes on the pool table three nice boxes now let me give you guys a backstory here
data/030941.wav|i love with yeah yeah i'm sort of a hardcore fan but i guess
data/007528.wav|it's a bit and i went over and again this guy
data/020586.wav|deus ex gamer i love this game there's a lot to like the stories are really fun
data/001628.wav|i'm pretty sure that's been like five ludwig titles anyway
data/011090.wav|sphinx man and i can't find his name what was his name
data/028410.wav|in front of all these people take this
data/032220.wav|now we're even on the weekend whatever we can't get
data/026500.wav|smooth sailing all the way through and it makes me makes me happy
data/014233.wav|we starting on twitch and being homegrown and then
data/029247.wav|as the honor and simple work and then i think on my stream we became fixated with the idea of trying to set free
data/031288.wav|just go and i swear to god i got out i got out and i got away with it and so
data/011051.wav|all past two weeks i'm looking for
data/016215.wav|there's no information that i can
data/005810.wav|obviously he made a mistake obviously
data/031459.wav|vegan um egg rolls or whatever
data/012887.wav|was probably a waste at least for sophomore year
data/010012.wav|description and it was like this guy is literally pay the musician
data/008814.wav|will be hurt and if that's that's part of it i i i
data/015418.wav|what disney let's talk about disney um
data/004267.wav|in between they're like a metaverse token
data/006334.wav|i recently i have an interview tomorrow and feel really good about it it's an interesting phrase because you
data/016573.wav|cyber security is getting more and more and more important it's an exponential increase because the risk of getting hacked is now incredibly high and the damage is incredibly bad for your company and so companies are getting more and more scared about
data/011294.wav|i don't but i don't know what this is and i don't know how to stop
data/006906.wav|full of free snacks full of free drinks i had a
data/032103.wav|i think he realizes that it has no ending and no point so he pulls the
data/016959.wav|at the fractional shares and the oh also
data/006023.wav|for like nothing can stop him he could be
data/017006.wav|not a huge one but a good one i think it's an interesting one i think it's
data/007255.wav|this is not a cloud nine
data/008023.wav|it's like what it's like before i played skyrim as a kid what i imagine skyrim would be
data/031801.wav|him out of nowhere showing up amaranth
data/028816.wav|and i was barely above what i was making but also i have almost no expenses and let me be clear the twitch office in that first year
data/014579.wav|i pay creators to leave they do it now they
data/001900.wav|it's not a big chunk of my income on twitch but i i think a revelation that maybe i
data/006718.wav|are you talking about and he was like no
data/010807.wav|we're like you have to watch more bs2
data/017932.wav|do it really well and sometimes they're doing
data/000420.wav|the specifically because he started to make fun of me and us he made fun of me
data/008388.wav|so i read the whole thing it's i
data/022879.wav|was full of children screaming basically over discord they played travis scott tunes advertised their youtube channel
data/020414.wav|flash forward 20 minutes and this
data/007538.wav|my burger i'm sitting right next to taffo
data/020483.wav|what you all know and love the witcher 3.
data/025984.wav|a company that hit the ground running in
data/024341.wav|why they should care about your company dude this is so up your own ass at the
data/025285.wav|are going to do a million things on this
data/024131.wav|why does every like did ninja
data/027932.wav|thought about it more and it really is a win because his employees who are now down
data/028612.wav|upon joining twitch this is all story
data/007966.wav|with some you know the hardest part for me it turns out is not really the topics
data/016142.wav|in monday baby got a big one
data/030392.wav|he's got like the mask and the face shield and i got my mask and we can't really hear each other that well and i lean
data/015413.wav|word of how they could get you they could
data/018308.wav|and gave the previous ceo a
data/018459.wav|who uploads twice a day every video gets
data/007836.wav|because what i was saying was funny and i don't
data/001842.wav|it is now down to a very absurd time i think it's down to
data/030938.wav|get another strike what were you playing that would
data/020031.wav|why google for 50 million dollars which is
data/011399.wav|i need to explain i got some pictures i got some photos and i want to walk you through it and then we can decide together whether or not i lost five racks
data/015138.wav|okay the average person doesn't care so your
data/028516.wav|if the face jail time like like the
data/004398.wav|in chat by the way everyone
data/019249.wav|that people would take pictures and download
data/004152.wav|think elden ring to play so it really is a
data/032327.wav|getting some of this stuff they cannot imagine that anyone else could do it anyone who has completed both knows the
data/025885.wav|was revealed at blizzard the immediate
data/010670.wav|now in fact i think here's the options i
data/031990.wav|you guys know blur from losing
data/022687.wav|be hands off the first thing she said was
data/002306.wav|right now even though you guys already know the bit it'd be
data/024266.wav|i feel like they had this whole set set up to do a matrix parody the red spoon red dress the agents and the thing
data/005803.wav|it seems like you don't care at all about the
data/014449.wav|a little bit safer on youtube youtube just
data/024187.wav|to start negotiating a better split and i
data/017371.wav|it almost pains me to say this but thank
data/031544.wav|then that happens now to explain what happens there this unit is called the reaver it's one of the most expensive
data/013948.wav|buy things more than they think they can afford and their paycheck comes around and then all of a sudden they are on the hook
data/005175.wav|oh i think my the big reason was
data/031833.wav|the hype slash fortnite i get it we all get it people that vape people that had more sex than me okay i get it but
data/025399.wav|what i would include this one this is a win no
data/017915.wav|allegan clapping and clapping and screaming and

data/005134.wav|on the menu i think you're thinking of
data/026198.wav|i crazy dude you idiot how do you understand the deep themes of this six hour epic

data/018069.wav|i think i'm learning so much about how the
data/001134.wav|that is just probably not solving
data/000768.wav|it's melee you have to find your champion so anyway i don't know it was just an idea while drunk i wasn't
data/025710.wav|i hated it i thought the ending was so bad you could you had a perfect opportunity to like make
data/030289.wav|sir boys what's up boys what's up
data/017760.wav|if you guys know that you know i generally will get more viewers than mango but mango has always sold
data/018278.wav|the toyota corolla is just the car to get you from a to b when a
data/009344.wav|she's actually yeah she just kept
data/024615.wav|in the past five years has been china recently
data/020904.wav|well all right now someone in
data/004040.wav|and i and i was sick
data/007889.wav|random equals funny i feel like everything he writes is so important it's scarcity
data/023911.wav|more views because of this you know i
data/024661.wav|what's more scary is that on our side our stock market is at absolute record
data/004695.wav|but we have to talk about some stuff we
data/008164.wav|and so i gotta i gotta practice and conor is a
data/014933.wav|we're talking about billion dollar deals we're
data/019728.wav|there are certain things you can do but first of all asking
data/008432.wav|to take all my previous titles and auto generate with an ai new titles does
data/025925.wav|wheat today valve has a multi-decade head start on competitive shooters
data/010112.wav|i have a video on napoleon's masterful greatest battle at austerlitz basically the best battle of his whole career that i've always wanted to watch so i'm gonna watch that i want to see how napoleon sort of made his
data/007292.wav|you get it though it's fine it's fine it's okay
data/008275.wav|good that was so cool so
data/004232.wav|because i had so many videos
data/012028.wav|it's like okay you have to hold here
data/010839.wav|it's not a great viewership game or you know it's tough to understand i'm going to grind it and i'm going to get good at it and i'm going to give my team my all
data/031939.wav|if people start to get mad like people sitting in the front like in in
data/015566.wav|i pick off the carcass of the dead and actually make some great profits
data/024401.wav|what the next week for a new marketing monday
data/021804.wav|i'm just gonna go buy a
data/024625.wav|to me because a few months ago we did an ad review where we watched the commercial berries and cream berries and
data/013166.wav|reacting no no sir i got named i got named and shamed
data/029661.wav|it's like what are you talking about now
data/020009.wav|much money 30 billion dollars is so much
data/031935.wav|is this the same block like the limo drivers just is literally just taking
data/016242.wav|i will start off with somebody who is contractually contractually not taking any else that is part of their contract to never be associated with an
data/026207.wav|and it's it's not the world's greatest experiment experience and for sound so we hooked that up to
data/002403.wav|you know what i'm saying east coasters just different dude i can't
data/011484.wav|it's an interesting story and when things feel better it's going to be a fun tale to tell
data/020704.wav|as whopper how did this win so many awards this
data/009256.wav|the with the nine months dark crescent over the two
data/027698.wav|from signing up with my code
data/001575.wav|yo yo how are you doing i'm doing good how are you i'm doing well
data/028373.wav|and whoever lasts the longest gets
data/005686.wav|i did not know because again going into this the only interaction
data/020300.wav|another thing you could have done is have mickey put the hat on his head mickey's
data/030885.wav|what got me sick is i think
data/021795.wav|in kansas all are more than welcome it's no secret the middle has been a hard place to get to lately
data/019481.wav|you think that'll chart chills bro
data/012340.wav|they don't make any sense it
data/025562.wav|john deere hopefully will have to actually negotiate with
data/009419.wav|his keyboard soraka can still die easy clap
data/012279.wav|this guy is definitely a lud bud
data/007135.wav|or mask and the guy's next to me
data/012822.wav|i am going to vegas they got us a suite i'm
data/025644.wav|and i've also been critical of nintendo for being way way way too lawsuit happy
data/018952.wav|but the problem and this is the bold take people said all the ads were annoying
data/015981.wav|a start making a lot of money that's what amazon did
data/017408.wav|they couldn't even get an image of me they just found a different white guy
data/000186.wav|never seen the hangover that's actually
data/024586.wav|the conscience and the judge said this is a billion dollar company and a trillion dollar company with a business dispute none of this involves the conscience
data/026719.wav|it's console wars video microsoft is a when it comes to gaming is a game
data/026894.wav|all mexican avocado imports are banned that is that is a bummer i'm sorry
data/025102.wav|people a lot of trouble i guess if all people know about it is that
data/026124.wav|welcome welcome to marketing monday but first we open as always with some wins and fails in the past week of business
data/024016.wav|but if they don't pay out if you miss a payout that's when you lose everybody if twitch stopped paying out top
data/017994.wav|yeah i i i don't know how it's
data/020512.wav|runs surprisingly well on current gen consoles this is 19 days ago
data/031363.wav|ryan seacrest with a spray tan i had a pretty fun birthday and i'm here to tell you about it
data/009714.wav|what if i give you a counteroffer i don't play it man i do exactly what i plan
data/015455.wav|in service to give it to give it uh
data/023307.wav|just smart and so many people think of how dream
data/031479.wav|i was like dude it is absurd how many millionaires there are just secret millionaires they just cluster in certain
data/024541.wav|so for example like if you want to subscribe on twit like if you want to
data/012990.wav|if but it's just like it feels
data/010265.wav|as a cooking show at the same time
data/010546.wav|okay well there's the okay there's the cutie from league of legends that i know okay there's the there's the league of legends coming out and
data/001531.wav|fair so i need to open up it okay um okay
data/010200.wav|water dripped down my pants or something or
data/001481.wav|what if there's a question oh i've got a question ha perfect i'm
data/031471.wav|with any way it was a fantastic weekend i only
data/008650.wav|rarely has to deal with money amounts this big the
data/004226.wav|it's not like a big deal it's not like if they did it like in the height of
data/005759.wav|it's impressive to be honest he
data/018792.wav|i will give you a rating get ready
data/013107.wav|a little late sure sure okay i wanted to eat dinner with ari i wanted to get all the tweets ready did i do both these things
data/006894.wav|where did you live in sff i lived in
data/018318.wav|and the founders and the employees make some money because they can sell their
data/011560.wav|i haven't watched the new batman i was
data/019050.wav|because there's so much more coming i decided i've
data/025859.wav|access you know that's your reward kind of deal now my editors will tell you i'm all for paying exposure
data/004787.wav|from the first tweet that he just
data/024908.wav|i couldn't fit these on different slides i
data/031608.wav|sleep on the floor like they just play
data/031751.wav|what a golden graham is and we would all know
data/004732.wav|around okay enough tomfoolery we got a big piece of news today we need to talk about it and it starts with this guy
data/027883.wav|it's like clearing the underbrush out
data/031901.wav|be a good friend all right
data/023071.wav|so the marketing in fact in food has gotten extremely good for example if i were to buy engine parts okay those are very specialized i
data/025701.wav|worry about games and guess what even though kevin butler is probably not the best pitch person these ads did phenomenally it turns out that the weird the
data/028127.wav|already listed publicly so they just merge with phase clan and become
data/019529.wav|come back to my discord i know she left but just like let's make it a clean break i gotta say the one thing that makes this ad so good is how cute they made the dog cute i said i didn't say sexy furries i said cute
data/025867.wav|but he talks about how blizzard tried to fly out scarra toast and a
data/011633.wav|or cruiser if you guys don't know about it disney
data/006696.wav|people were like messaging me like hey
data/029446.wav|the boss is like no no i
data/000357.wav|we incredibly incredibly fun and very competitive and we're drunk so
data/014694.wav|i'll give two shits hey one thing mods can you be extra harsh
data/012124.wav|i of together but we already know
data/031366.wav|significant others rochelle ari and cutie cinderella did a little triple date
data/015200.wav|and audiences are still watching them it was
data/024840.wav|it's a new champion that champion generally is
data/013890.wav|you idiots how do you understand the
data/027167.wav|the value of my shiba coin yes so
data/028819.wav|was like paradise the twitch office had a gigantic wall
data/009360.wav|that's what i'm saying end of the day
data/025342.wav|asked me the night before the stream because
data/031581.wav|the army with an ambush in the middle of the map while it's running back home
data/001988.wav|it's a very easy business to set up and run and so everyone wanted to do one and then
data/025441.wav|the world but coke did one better coke
data/028128.wav|at way you can skip all the red tape and instantly go public and that was
data/021806.wav|was created for this ad specifically preach corporation
data/014329.wav|a very smart man at netflix who is now the ceo reed hastings
data/009476.wav|a little bit worse as tyler picks up all these minions worth noting tyler also has the
data/001567.wav|i guess he didn't even do obama or trump that was shocking he did five presidents no obama or trump giga chad challenge
data/011456.wav|i am not a big simple plan fan i don't
data/014876.wav|i think the executives on the xbox side kind of get it i think they understand where they're at and how they can keep growing and they keep doing
data/030302.wav|it'd be my best man because he's sort of everybody's best he's the best
data/020450.wav|if all time and i think when you promise somebody this and you give them this there has to be a reckoning there is a problem that is how you get that is how you get this the
data/015221.wav|and it's also why if you're if you're someone who's
data/009489.wav|the shopkeeper will stop accepting gold
data/018475.wav|and microsoft watched dude bill gates
data/029117.wav|i got this like trial by fire start out and then on my day one of the job the biggest thing like every monitor at
data/025663.wav|the monday today's topic is the scariest spookiest ads
data/026396.wav|we're just marketing that makes you feel more part of the apple ecosystem once you buy an apple product you get access to the blue
data/007321.wav|which i think was like five to one or
data/007265.wav|i got photos of it all right we're back
data/026191.wav|and i would have given him a win but unfortunately when things do well in the gaming industry
data/031063.wav|and then i met him in person
data/007034.wav|it is awesome because i really cherish
data/001734.wav|at the back in those days like they don't know
data/000256.wav|there and like i love these guys and they all surprised me i
data/014143.wav|at go to youtube go to go to facebook go to mixer and around the same time mixer implodes and dies so that's another big spending competitor in microsoft
data/024917.wav|the bad luck out of the way now the good luck is here and that is of course not how it works it also applies the sunk cost fallacy sun costs the same thing so
data/016101.wav|am i what am i what's happening here so in conclusion is
data/002603.wav|of our heads and you got tails it's not morbius god
data/018244.wav|it is stares at him he just stares at him he just looks at
data/027222.wav|hold a screenshot of horizon zero dawns
data/010300.wav|seen him by fall guys not once now i
data/000231.wav|if usually at craps if one person wins
data/005637.wav|he wasn't like that around the school stuff because he literally everything
data/002824.wav|as business reasons to talk about elon musk
data/016320.wav|about a mcdonald's mascot not the one you're thinking of the moon one that we talked about mac tonight now
data/014693.wav|hey you build a server you
data/022468.wav|all the time i'm gonna show you one more that i found to be super impressive only because i've heard the marketers that
data/030499.wav|and then i say this is my line
data/021057.wav|yeah ship your pants billy you can ship
data/023573.wav|i think about it my final example is when you go too far with that is
data/002312.wav|let's see what we got here on the stream
data/006277.wav|let me eat as much as i can
data/014412.wav|for youtube is technically just so much better but that should be
data/004356.wav|i know you want to just type in the chat
data/006800.wav|in the text to say you got this king ludwig shamed me in the night
data/008684.wav|if the people that have done m a uh
data/000005.wav|you were like five or six red
data/008677.wav|five plus years twitter has had over half its users be bots and then it's been lying to every advertiser that
data/025296.wav|watch the show you want and then cancel but with netflix people consider netflix to be like just like electricity water netflix you just have to have it either you have somebody's password or you buy
data/014363.wav|in the united states and disrupt these guys but for now it's only these two and
data/018759.wav|with sony and microsoft so i think i talked about this
data/008496.wav|lawsuit by twitter to elon musk i read the whole good
data/025153.wav|get a taste of the new flow this is so weird because
data/016903.wav|worms this could be uh coaching this this
data/026138.wav|and i again i don't compliment roblox on much
data/030841.wav|the spartans very cool do any of your co-workers know me
data/030757.wav|so when i was at twitch i tweeted this
data/025223.wav|that was honestly more of a fail but
data/006395.wav|speaking of corporations doing the right thing i want to give a big win to companies that really believe in their employees that
data/009297.wav|just go and a bunch of games i put money into riot
data/010892.wav|and i'm going to reveal what i will be wearing and doing
data/014177.wav|to informed so i will just say obviously
data/022473.wav|actual problems that skaters faced what
data/015745.wav|another have to start like lying or being shady about it they have to start like lying or being
data/020096.wav|which is like the genius thing to do in your off
data/002638.wav|do something and then i spend money on it there has to be some kind of game
data/019380.wav|i had an excel sheet showing what all
data/030688.wav|well out of it because it turns out the prize was
data/005409.wav|so it's got me thinking about you know what i can learn anyway
data/002063.wav|it's okay this is okay this
data/007426.wav|insanely impressed by his edge guarding but you know as as confident yeah that was
data/017707.wav|the have used it to a friend in the world it is one of the greatest measures of brand
data/003430.wav|which can moving on but it's always been a powder keg and it's seems clear that after
data/012844.wav|like the lowest point of my whole life
data/007149.wav|should proclamation yeah what similar struggle right
data/001167.wav|i can talk about them because they're defunct back when i lived in san francisco proper i would order sprig every day until eventually they made me the
data/012353.wav|the money's worth so i tried everything
data/025454.wav|it's a few minutes before this segment for the youtube viewers a few minutes before
data/021965.wav|what can get an amazing combo video
data/024959.wav|it's basically what i got for today
data/011861.wav|every time you go in there
data/028435.wav|if i just started rapping i would have been yellow wolf exactly
data/019828.wav|of no man's sky it's really long so we can't watch
data/008964.wav|million dollars on twitter that's what it
data/026734.wav|like they're gonna have to give a huge cut to
data/006164.wav|whenever i play that fruit matching game i just alter
data/023026.wav|which is not really a bad thing but they're kind of trying to scare the judge and scare they're basically
data/015121.wav|from minute one it was the first time people had done this you
data/012928.wav|and people to see whatever your marketing
data/016558.wav|the world to determine how these things play out the technology doesn't really decide whether it ends up good or bad it's going to happen
data/026169.wav|i yeah i was i was i was uh
data/013387.wav|i get it but that being said if they're
data/009366.wav|wait they're getting into it i wonder if on the side of team ninja so team mr beast won the first game
data/016546.wav|and that's sort the theme of today esports going up let me show you another one ah maybe to notice hopefully i and that's sort of the theme of today esports going up let me show you another
data/029331.wav|the guy he's like look he even got
data/013290.wav|means you have invited me to the wedding and i
data/025269.wav|the main thing and i'm going
data/026270.wav|it does not support that line of thought
data/015011.wav|and the king of the jungle we have netflix okay and i want to play a little sound that i had quack pull for
data/022864.wav|idiot in wall street history if you had just
data/005385.wav|and your fingernails my problem for me is that it took a long time and you know i don't want to drive to a nail
data/019884.wav|believe me but in this game
data/006558.wav|which is the pay later where you have to pay later
data/014692.wav|is your server so true king so
data/024550.wav|you are legally allowed to have a button that says a button or some sort of
data/008347.wav|the president will come to your house personally and give you
data/022059.wav|i thought this is a good ass
data/009205.wav|there are some games where you can kind of like play a little bit watch a little bit and get better starcraft's one of
data/003373.wav|is because he got out just in time
data/023586.wav|i think it's a good framework and
data/019740.wav|was our bars i thought our only defense
data/011253.wav|when robin one of my other roommates when she first moved in she did a
data/005767.wav|i think he knows what he's doing i think
data/024315.wav|i wanted to know what he was what is that it that we're doing you know it's just so weird
data/009201.wav|your friends that's such a rare example
data/026601.wav|every thursday on nickelodeon milo the beloved head geek at a popular strip mall comic
data/021773.wav|trailer as a horror film because what
data/017659.wav|the the renewed focus on packaging apple has an entire division devoted just to
data/010565.wav|you thought you were my best man you cutie cinderella we're under the
data/028209.wav|to uh to make it happen yeah bobby bobby
data/005390.wav|your nail art into an nft
data/005371.wav|wave back that guy didn't wave back because i knew he wasn't waving at me and jarvis
data/008305.wav|so i'm gonna call my my boss fish
data/015053.wav|and they had a key advantage they were a first mover so let's one second
data/000627.wav|profound you know i was like
data/025642.wav|if you guys know how i've been uh
data/005093.wav|posts per day like the rest of us
data/025826.wav|it will not be drawing me back in to play ranked league of legends that being said i don't think these
data/026471.wav|i thought about nvidia just because i it's my work
data/003869.wav|here's a chance biden doesn't run again i think there's a chance biden doesn't run again
data/026655.wav|a fraction of a share and if amazon goes up
data/021652.wav|i legends let's do this they reunited him holy
data/004259.wav|okay how about step one all chinese computers fortnite pre-installed free v
data/020749.wav|random misinformation then they run outside and
data/006475.wav|it's they mentioned this article a mail carrier wrote it that
data/007505.wav|here i'll make it better for you and she
data/009538.wav|no a little bit of trading but we've got
data/019277.wav|right around here when their biggest and by far most hyped and most important
data/013493.wav|with the a ring on it
data/010299.wav|yeah it would be awesome to ask northern lion i don't know that if he's available
data/024432.wav|it set up to where the main walkway angle is where you see it most beautifully so there was a good one
data/012828.wav|right before the tournament by the way it's crazy because nick allen a guy that i'm friends with that guy was
data/026611.wav|i get dunked on social so they always pay so you know they're probably not going
data/014358.wav|right now they use like instagram live who's
data/002827.wav|first phase of this battle was what time the the the court date would take place okay twitter wanted to happen as soon as
data/024275.wav|they just throw in this random singing scene that's
data/021104.wav|i like the most about it
data/027823.wav|it's a risky thing because a lot of these companies are not good let me show you an example
data/008022.wav|and i'm just i'm just really
data/028145.wav|on that is not a business worth one billion dollars i know
data/013852.wav|if the threats and this includes all of us as gamers every threat
data/001754.wav|was very very dark so anyway i recommend uh
data/003101.wav|twitch streamers not youtube streamers twitch streamers you know why because we
data/029773.wav|and android win doubles and they get
data/028140.wav|which was awesome but unfortunately they actually
data/010106.wav|or saturdays and let me just confirm confirm
data/023294.wav|five billion dollars in value and of course everyone wrote four million articles about it oh my god oh my god it is a testament to the power of
data/017870.wav|if if there's someone who's still good
data/019780.wav|they cranked up the graphics they ran it on
data/028459.wav|well the me because i'm 12
data/030415.wav|the photographer i literally don't have one anymore i
data/017018.wav|without warming up first shooting around okay it's but it's even more difficult
data/029249.wav|we were going to try to release him from the box
data/028220.wav|we're gonna get good at melee
data/013351.wav|how do you talk to people in real life that's insane you see a water bottle
data/024149.wav|in that time was kind of the worst time to blow up if you wanted to get a big deal so it kind of felt bad for someone like i
data/017793.wav|megawatt mangled banger mango had mango banger mango
data/015649.wav|not working so far so those are our key competitors let me let me take a final stop here and figure out
data/028722.wav|it's like real journalist it's like wall
data/026131.wav|and it's a guy who's been
data/005652.wav|that i'm sitting next to misskip
data/020980.wav|and they review consumers and i'm like damn that cannot be the funniest thing it just
data/026939.wav|everything mentioned in this ad is a real massive problem happening right now for people buying homes buying homes
data/014668.wav|new dictionary and then you said zero percent
data/027200.wav|we can also follow a lot of acclaimed investors and follow their moves you could follow for example kimball musk and sell tesla when he did and most importantly for me that makes it stand out from its competition here is that
data/016270.wav|i can't believe it you think the leader
data/023494.wav|technically all months at ford are truck
data/031652.wav|it properly and so my arm gets tired and he
data/002464.wav|like extreme purchasers and they would categorize people in that and they made
data/005621.wav|at all i wanted was for a friend of mine's
data/021197.wav|and so we're getting space jam
data/026040.wav|with the world's largest private employer by
data/017131.wav|that'd be the slung what a beautiful song what a
data/027964.wav|if the for fast fast and the furious
data/028493.wav|why don't get yelled at but i
data/022956.wav|battle passes and skins so epic games is a lot of things they run unreal engine they did fortnite they have the epic game store they have rocket league
data/019375.wav|the travel company to the laptop company in every market okay we put a laptop in every pot
data/014399.wav|is vaude easy easy access to
data/004101.wav|hey dad when do we start when i feel like it
data/024920.wav|and you you want to follow up that you
data/023248.wav|i stick to my tried and true chipotle
data/026796.wav|if the the government is um
data/026366.wav|it worked quite well because when people spend a lot of money on a product the fact
data/016755.wav|the off a cliff and we're going to enter a realm where there's a lot of old people and not enough people
data/010743.wav|there's going to be an actual fire here and i'm going to roast the live and this clip is going to be so ominous
data/004481.wav|that is an interesting line of thought is
data/007596.wav|it is after all a targeting tuesday let me change my title
data/016224.wav|i think you're actually you know what we should
data/003656.wav|running grandchildren of wealthy families generational wealth is the
data/020051.wav|so if you get a chance it
data/031394.wav|quit his job but before that he was making
data/001431.wav|let me get the music okay yeah i will tell you i was kicked
data/020888.wav|like that down in my phone and bring it to a pitch later i would never open up my notes app
data/025400.wav|no commentary necessary let's all watch this and if you think it's a win spam w
data/017603.wav|you can't do all of the things as well as everybody you can't put all your money in everything you have to
data/022348.wav|it's like and this my friends is what it smells like hi there i'm
data/027557.wav|i'm trying to keep it simple if uh one
data/010822.wav|or balloons or it's fall guys those are my options
data/026996.wav|in dollar ad costing them tens of millions more because everyone that signed up
data/009601.wav|is not in they will lose wholeheartedly
data/024180.wav|million plus at me then i would never do that okay
data/014178.wav|the things i mentioned about these still how true
data/013418.wav|at this and it says cuck-e-cheeses
data/014996.wav|and sports used to be the one
data/022191.wav|come home buddy you and me we were made for love
data/025610.wav|is now alphabet so what does that leave us with
data/010844.wav|the blunt rotation bro you want
data/007289.wav|and flick off not the crowd
data/009295.wav|our wallets even if we don't use the loot boxes
data/017379.wav|spider-man alone was by far the most successful movie of
data/013274.wav|wait for prime it's sad but true
data/001905.wav|it's like twitch has paying subs like i have
data/009089.wav|it's been way way way way too long it's been almost a thousand years maybe when the next rts comes out i'll
data/007603.wav|so i could tell hilarious stories about them but
data/000700.wav|one of my oldest friends i've actually known him even longer than stan's this
data/028715.wav|i was trying to impress him and it worked and he was interested he was like hey tell you what well if you're press how about i see
data/025488.wav|if the stock okay but there's a
data/000026.wav|hit him with a quick little w yeah i
data/020463.wav|has shed over 30 percent of their value
data/001781.wav|as with any other employees you understand me higher yeah is that mr wonka
data/019244.wav|what are the what is the advantage
data/014848.wav|but they already function in the same way and so adding this extra layer of needing a crypto account on top of it and and making games about monetization basically for the developer i mean
data/015654.wav|you know there's there's there's money and there's that
data/013207.wav|it change being unstoppable that's going to kill the mood i i know i told you
data/029220.wav|i you do it whatever you need brother i'm
data/023030.wav|what the fever is going around i'd like to stop to a second and i want to sue twitch
data/004426.wav|it'll be on saturday i think it'll be dope it wasn't a vacation it was a
data/015771.wav|or on hulu that have been there as part of
data/006815.wav|on prime the boys season 3 watch party
data/004858.wav|company especially ones that had their stock dropped
data/002784.wav|your question i wouldn't answer anyway but you don't mention your question so it's
data/020557.wav|so far is number one most
data/015065.wav|so they got friends they got tons of movies they had basically early netflix back in
data/013365.wav|at best tweets so here's what's different
data/008615.wav|we bought it you know you wouldn't give a
data/031662.wav|this was like a tiny corner of the back of the event hall it was like massive starcraft stage massive counter-strike stage and a tiny
data/017341.wav|i have worked for amazon at some point including myself by the way i have
data/011214.wav|you're not in arizona right now
data/017612.wav|schools of thought okay they created
data/029039.wav|well he weighs more than me stronger than me would probably beat me
data/023914.wav|which is a cringe thing to say
data/019872.wav|every year to add new content it has 20 years of content
data/020608.wav|it sounded studio quality too and that
data/020892.wav|i want a quarter of the time let alone make decisions and learn robots follow their faces when
data/018817.wav|i was very successful on my on my scale it
data/021294.wav|we'll see that and do nothing as they've always done i predicted
data/024323.wav|so bad but if you are if
data/011370.wav|alright let's go that's my favorite glorketer
data/021880.wav|in cars in front of him
data/023110.wav|the one i want to talk about the most the most sneaky is for a long long long time we just didn't give a
data/017586.wav|as keep their value longer than other cars and because of that this this amazing
data/017352.wav|i could not possibly cringe any harder midlife crisis without saying midlife crisis
data/016592.wav|it's a genius idea they just made like
data/030154.wav|he won game one i got a pop-up
data/009930.wav|about the wedding and the answer is yes he's
data/027483.wav|bottom of it and explain what it means for twitter how it came to be and sort of what's what's gonna happen next
data/022174.wav|so over the top jesus christ that's really really emotionally if that had been like a documentary i would have said powerful but to sell life insurance that's low man the
data/027023.wav|and i said well i've seen a horse and a dog so far so it's definitely budweiser they have a type they have a type and it's very distinct
data/017239.wav|what the campaign and the fact they thought the best way to deliver that campaign on social was
data/018499.wav|microsoft having a beef with someone and going and buying a car that's about as much the other person makes in a year yeah they make about
data/022771.wav|to confirm it was ten thousand dollars per user they had about half a million users on
data/001198.wav|i've done cup ramen as well but i feel
data/028585.wav|on this shirt okay well let me tell you before i joined twitch i attempted to become a professional league of legends player
data/010922.wav|we want to build something and it's uh you
data/031434.wav|as it became clear we all had a weakness to our throw and a strength
data/014051.wav|what the youtube and i think it's going to be powerful second thing they got
data/013163.wav|a boss rush is fun though ooh i would play a boss rush
data/005988.wav|im a value it's not super fun to watch planking but it's also
data/029038.wav|and that's where i know we're fighting okay so he's
data/030232.wav|anyway yeah actual children this is mango
data/019814.wav|if only number eight is is
data/025008.wav|it's about gaming brands most hated gaming brands and i
data/015477.wav|wants to do that because it would cut into what they currently have too much and even when they do
data/028625.wav|work one day and i realize
data/007694.wav|and so obviously if i'm getting married to her i should be able to speak spanish right no i don't
data/007181.wav|a new york just saying like man
data/004805.wav|we has no the way the
data/014077.wav|get off my dick jeff did you actually
data/023968.wav|do this what's going on i think a lot of the takes i've seen on the only
data/000279.wav|insane amounts so the hotel is expecting
data/026380.wav|their products have what i have called the flex factor which means they are very consciously consumable when you see
data/014475.wav|and you know what i'm not
data/013342.wav|in bad and we had to throw them
data/029866.wav|if they felt like they were
data/011600.wav|where it was in the timeline like i didn't need that to know where it
data/030844.wav|and will that give you a better chance at getting a job at
data/026127.wav|you could possibly imagine if you guys don't know jack dorsey ceo of twitter was a
data/009053.wav|bonnie think of the three sporadic space
data/009292.wav|it's like some percent of the population
data/023577.wav|they were essentially giving you free movie tickets for 10 bucks a month you
data/021050.wav|is probably one of the funniest
data/021529.wav|after hurt regular people we have to hurt stupid people to hurt
data/015027.wav|we just hold for one second if you're busy like me have you just hold for one second please if you just hold for one second if you're busy like me if you just hold for one second
data/000499.wav|know that i got one yeah it was awful it was awful
data/031048.wav|i try to testify against vlad that they
data/016435.wav|i just want that to be something that i stand for
data/010493.wav|what a firefly another season actually i want
data/009105.wav|talking about finish the book what you have
data/026499.wav|or a single bad project isn't that awesome i'm just so happy that
data/010726.wav|milk tax fraud yeah there's no rule on tax
data/026193.wav|death stranding style movie and i'm
data/025168.wav|they got him in an ad and they sold a ton more juice so they they they capitalized on
data/015052.wav|what it took off it was it was pretty successful
data/008696.wav|their lawsuit that i'm looking at here is like pretty open about it like they they
data/003344.wav|and i've always been like this and it's just become a little bit more hard to hear because the news is becoming real and not just me talking about it
data/031908.wav|the marilyn monroe to prom yeah that's it i
data/012734.wav|but not get extra money or promotion or or anything
data/000139.wav|oh my god and his other message was one

data/009555.wav|well he still could big yasuo
data/023142.wav|was revenue and nothing it's not just naming it's also visuals if there's one thing i've learned from food marketing it's how important
data/018140.wav|if the pepsi game that is crazy i could not imagine nowadays trying to pitch this to a brand that's base
data/023645.wav|this is an article on billboard history i was that's what i read for fun i was halfway through this when i started streep that's crazy yeah i was reading about the history of billboards this this is an article on billboard history i was that's what i read for fun i was halfway through this when i started

data/002619.wav|on your side and i've already bumped you
data/023252.wav|what was the actual source of these chic
data/001201.wav|i don't think i would eat
data/009699.wav|i have this thing where i'm really
data/002400.wav|watch during prime grind time what do you mean
data/004402.wav|with the partnership a truck j mcflyquest
data/020801.wav|that leaves only one award remaining one final award and for this final award for the grand finale i couldn't be the one to read it we got a special guest ludwig
data/026911.wav|i think it's pretty smart i think as far as ads
data/005192.wav|what i was wearing a kolkata
data/030456.wav|it was like it was low-key it
data/030641.wav|michael and that's it that's the only fact i took from the book and i'm in the geography bee and it's like i'm a little nervous all right because we got all the kids up on the auditorium stage and uh a lot of them are older than me
data/020392.wav|i would of course yeah i would kill the parents that would have that yep there we go
data/007053.wav|i also i knew a guy i knew a guy when i worked at twitch
data/004464.wav|it's not for me the big
data/019778.wav|if you watch what they were talking about at
data/031671.wav|that was kind of cool actually
data/025839.wav|the game and so you can
data/001522.wav|one second i'm thinking about it
data/006874.wav|i didn't quite understand how expensing worked
data/031944.wav|recently in the news at the time where a
data/026922.wav|they got two big time celebrities they made the
data/000968.wav|fight a tiger and there's not
data/025534.wav|better online deals all that shit's
data/025665.wav|some of these but first before i do let me give
data/007284.wav|oh recreation i had to recreate the
data/032216.wav|if the three hours and then go all in at the end of the night
data/020598.wav|the front of the building someone
data/006080.wav|i can't stand them can't stand them dude i can't stand anyone would write a paragraph about that being like oh my
data/001190.wav|they were like hey can we support get smarter
data/000138.wav|you're so far behind the goddamn curve
data/026362.wav|tech support they were outsourcing tech
data/025852.wav|it's such a day and night difference i had a riot event and then i had a blizzard
data/011705.wav|way like the map says go that way that's
data/001191.wav|that's why i like them they've been easy to work with they let me move my thing
data/008229.wav|is that there's a chance that could work but
data/013411.wav|well people are entertained that's a good

data/015900.wav|or disney or netflix could merge okay i just don't think or disney or netflix could merge okay i just don't think i don't think it would happen i think it would give them too much market power and it would be
data/025899.wav|it's policy against sexual harassment and there was a great
data/024239.wav|i'm going to say i'm gonna say it i'm gonna say i

data/025579.wav|these people have the least human conversation i have ever seen this is what we get incredible developers like vertigo games the studio behind fan
data/023903.wav|it cemented him as the goat i don't think anything else could i think the fact that he came back from so many slumps to win against the best to do it right now

data/016993.wav|pretty easy read and it's uh it's funny it's
data/004354.wav|is actually my post and i
data/004246.wav|crypto solves this crypto solves this dude
data/006028.wav|your trash dude by the way hey
data/019221.wav|by the way if you have any idea of what technology was like in
data/023684.wav|anything and then respond by saying pay your
data/002610.wav|i will be cutting it off there you do not
data/007136.wav|tossing it away like you'll never use it
data/006788.wav|i was sponsoring him for phantom his next major event
data/016165.wav|but last is kind of cool it's almost like sigma you know
data/002431.wav|teen months and x aquatics name
data/018320.wav|whether you're on the exchange anyone can buy you
data/031590.wav|oh my god i got chills dude it was really so fun to watch anyway that's i wanted to share that i
data/016045.wav|i asked my dad about slime it'll be really funny
data/028197.wav|it's freaking out and so twitch in one of twitch's first big like
data/001707.wav|as we descended upon the globe
data/031306.wav|but we're there for like 15-20
data/023460.wav|they'd have a bigger margin they don't because they want a bigger
data/004422.wav|we got back he reached out to me we're
data/020151.wav|it's funnier but that's not one you can get past the board
data/029066.wav|so i only knew curtis for another half half a year so it's like
data/012751.wav|is he at one point had more games of
data/001940.wav|i could just get a little more free time a little bit
data/021941.wav|let's say we make a big decision decide
data/021244.wav|with the gaming okay the amount of money that gaming makes dwarfs all other forms of media so let's make a
data/014832.wav|some of them are scam sale
data/015862.wav|i was really shaken out yet i kind of want to get more data on how it's doing before i make any bold claims but
data/032037.wav|so i've told this story but
data/014345.wav|on youtube is much bigger twitch needs to grow and it needs to grow out of just the gaming niche community the hardcore
data/010349.wav|i should have two computers that's actually five head i should play two at once it's lyric
data/010886.wav|and then between that they show crypto
data/014766.wav|you guys could be saved i personally
data/028669.wav|right after that dude how was i not fired twitch culture in the early days was like so crazy
data/026924.wav|think it'd be higher of the of the mid tier
data/009406.wav|bro i feel like they're doing everything wrong on
data/014060.wav|and they have out here for someone that like does the work of 10 people
data/011743.wav|which is fine okay whatever that's fine but
data/005821.wav|if you didn't it wasn't on
data/011615.wav|i'm working like a dog and so i can't really take any time off to do
data/013662.wav|for a modern audience so if you guys
data/030153.wav|would you still fast what are the odds
data/023811.wav|at the office lately seems to be causing a
data/031674.wav|and i'm like i keep every
data/014536.wav|tune in tomorrow when i have
data/000528.wav|last time we were in vegas as a crew it was
data/007599.wav|two years i've been watching you i didn't realize we shared a birthday happy birthday to us both
data/022568.wav|an excellent ad excellent april fool's joke
data/010435.wav|right because we understand that i don't actually drink coffee yeah mac and cheese yeah yeah all
data/022860.wav|we didn't like stocks all the time and then they said do you remember an example and he said yeah i said it about amazon i was one of the
data/030956.wav|and let's start over nice to meet you where
data/022393.wav|in some kind of events i
data/009690.wav|get his liver eaten out by an eagle
data/028038.wav|the progress unions are making and they are literally focusing insane efforts for example starbucks just announced an illegal wage increase that would only apply to
data/016524.wav|okay it's already gotten bigger counter-strike became the first
data/002708.wav|to walk away how about this you can stop now and take
data/010566.wav|impression that you were the best man to my wedding and there was nothing that you thought
data/026006.wav|we making or inventing anything then sexism is
data/005304.wav|was it was it was wild and so big ass line was a little bit awkward because i have
data/029929.wav|deal because it had not happened and we thought it couldn't happen let's watch
data/001487.wav|you are actually possibly the final guest on this brand new amazing show with deep production values atomic i want to ask you first
data/018249.wav|i am happy to share it with
data/004133.wav|it's in a competitive video game would you rather
data/031631.wav|and i said like i don't
data/025777.wav|at a time when they needed good news the most they were given bad blizzard's president
data/018968.wav|it's cannot handle that pressure so those two things are the fundamental problems they don't understand how attention span works they needed this they need
data/007705.wav|that's a smart idea and then once i get really good at spanish
data/018385.wav|to know what they're paying for in one that's better tagline that's a better tagline than i've heard from a lot of
data/000862.wav|five gifted i do appreciate zebby
data/006932.wav|which the dress code was like wear anything
data/017980.wav|that's this is such a drag back into the past
data/027233.wav|this made some developers angry and
data/017623.wav|at the prices they do so they created these um these stores
data/022238.wav|turning their ipad into a surrogate parent every single problem has been dealt by toss the kids
data/004535.wav|and they all seem fantastic i'm sure none of them are stupid but due to time constraints and the fact that i have a guest i'm going to jump into wins and phil let me
data/006757.wav|i just do it all right
data/013397.wav|let's see we have a lot of
data/005047.wav|have anything too much deeper to say i like
data/016743.wav|i think trying to imply that everyone's
data/010767.wav|if you know what i'm saying
data/005278.wav|each other each one trying to make sure that
data/023569.wav|this applies to every company if you think about every company you can figure out
data/023439.wav|now if you'll know i spend my work hours working i spend my after work hours streaming or grinding hollow knight
data/013354.wav|you can't talk like that to people
data/010495.wav|actually didn't even like the movie that much if
data/025858.wav|we're giving you exposure you get advanced
data/013108.wav|what hilarious tweets ready to go it's rare to have tweets this funny this consistently
data/015323.wav|money by the standards of any other studio in
data/018970.wav|getting back and forth that creates the the ability to calm your mind that's what zoomers use it for okay
data/012271.wav|well dice and it's kind of legit all right
data/010345.wav|in here we weren't talking about
data/015173.wav|is that this was produced locally in south korea and this
data/005624.wav|like oh interesting you know i haven't
data/018852.wav|if this guy doesn't get cut to
data/025846.wav|somewhat cinematics could have given their team a chance giving them extra money
data/029581.wav|gotten so many top players to say things that really reinforce the the
data/023649.wav|i guess i'll just share it with you right now i was actually gonna
data/029270.wav|with the squad the greatest squad
data/015518.wav|there's not like a ton of movies and shows on there it's only originals that they've made in the last two years it's all brand new content
data/013655.wav|or down and i said so i can right and they
data/000126.wav|as a question they know the answer to
data/013277.wav|it's super smash brothers tournament chat do you guys think we could win are you guys good enough at spamming commands into a twitch chat very interesting all of you immediately said no and then you all said
data/024624.wav|deserved and this one of course goes to
data/001773.wav|talk about a willy wonka film it's less than a
data/017398.wav|let me just uh let me just
data/027683.wav|we do attract engineering talent to find some
data/024335.wav|it's company bro and we didn't
data/001826.wav|he has been talking about neom for a while
data/006999.wav|and so i got like i got to see some people that watch the stream which is
data/028424.wav|and when i was let's say i must have been
data/023461.wav|or market share they want a lot of people using it either way

data/026962.wav|but with these goggles you can enjoy a fake version of the world you remembered
data/011587.wav|out of touch and cringe but the most frequent problem that i encounter is that people ruin my opinions for me by being people that i don't like how do i
data/017468.wav|and the internet which severely hampered their ability to hire scabs

data/009872.wav|it wasn't tough but like getting to
data/016825.wav|and things that are built for
data/002477.wav|we need to find a way to make them
data/010474.wav|we all have every time i say i don't want something
data/013918.wav|is there are starting to pop up that are having massive success under a model that is being called
data/020134.wav|the theory i have about canadian marketing
data/022910.wav|i remember when fortnite was at its absolute biggest in
data/010432.wav|what are they going to want the wedding
data/001263.wav|which account is it sega west
data/022422.wav|it's good but it was the most blatant and i saw it when i was young and it just sort of
data/030300.wav|that you would not embarrass me maybe dream
data/020370.wav|sister this is the one time where i
data/007137.wav|oh yeah and it's like all right fine you know what
data/005520.wav|it was tough for me but i i did it
data/013346.wav|and something morally wrong and then admitted it because that makes you sort
data/028019.wav|the call that the only cause of
data/024190.wav|in the fails i think that was the main ones i'm
data/025034.wav|the company founded by a white guy named glenn bell who made basic ass
data/024456.wav|is now starting to close some stores and
data/012275.wav|i made it to the finals of everyone on
data/005482.wav|and then just turns away and walks
data/017845.wav|go for example or at least making inroads because
data/006436.wav|in existence this orb can be used as a power source in the upcoming space exploration game and should give your guild a great advantage
data/004945.wav|it the court goes you know what elon's
data/026942.wav|is the solution all without feeling too rushed
data/011425.wav|i appreciate it obviously you're on the right track
data/030627.wav|i started reading a lot more because of
data/016157.wav|widget that i have the journalists who go
data/001675.wav|and i definitely want to dive into it i think it's really fascinating but not right now
data/031232.wav|at esports secretly because i love them and i was also like
data/028122.wav|i have a company public especially one that's not
data/024650.wav|what we're doing great we're doing great we're doing
data/012180.wav|walk an emergency people are looking at me like
data/008459.wav|at the bounds they have to go someone has to get it there's not
data/029921.wav|i ever been done and they didn't even really
data/017331.wav|because of the scale of amazon basically anyone
data/027306.wav|really undercut that because we're not all that mentally strong for a lot of people getting stuck on
data/005321.wav|ludwig based event but it was because jarvis johnson
data/019270.wav|raging entirely in Twitter comments on
data/001790.wav|how about my favorite new song oh
data/027364.wav|well you can keep up over all your games of course they've done it
data/008630.wav|get free money but you know what i'm saying let's if you have a bad business
data/012936.wav|you know a lot of traditional marketing
data/024072.wav|because i think they're trying new stuff it's the release of their new
data/015291.wav|and they're not stopping there so look at this
data/001774.wav|he mrs bucket i found a photo in charlie's
data/011244.wav|it's pretty fun thing to do for a bit
data/000749.wav|not doing much social stuff for the past like eight months really because i've
data/026575.wav|needs to get the richest streamer in the world a pr
data/018384.wav|i think that snapchat officially offered that's good marketing direct good direct marketing the
data/028211.wav|it comes down to the office and he's interviewing and this is where i sort of get to talk to blur for real for the first time we
data/021852.wav|the thing that sort of explains then
data/001701.wav|as much of a joke as the original website i think it's also true that they are often shared sincerely and that they satisfy a white hot anger towards the
data/007486.wav|he pointed to it can i have the original joe but he pointed to the burger and
data/027311.wav|but i think is the the downside you know this is
data/015606.wav|it's not a bad deal broker's not a bad
data/008325.wav|one day where he just couldn't make any more vids
data/009879.wav|in dollars it's a great time to move to
data/022875.wav|and screaming at the top of their lungs to a federal judge
data/027488.wav|if you like it or not immediately becomes something that like determines your political party instantly i'm
data/013727.wav|do me i want only the most toxic to get
data/001453.wav|in the line if you could answer
data/019139.wav|as marketing who's got the best marketing who's got the best
data/023272.wav|but i got mad that she was getting
data/008936.wav|i use twitter for 54.20 a
data/005164.wav|i mean that's pretty close for a nail
data/026221.wav|use these products is because they are afraid of credit card debt in fact one of the main drivers of klarna's audience is that
data/015368.wav|talent they've got a great talent development program this is a picture let's make it smaller here for
data/000979.wav|or because it implies a world where the
data/008449.wav|so you're taking the piss okay that's okay there's no chance even if you're not paying attention it's very obvious which side's the goal
data/028783.wav|the salary my current salary but for this job
data/011194.wav|no take away my diploma they can't i don't think i don't think so either
data/026213.wav|or buy now pay later by the way if you don't know about
data/029227.wav|i got to go behind the stage right and he's like our ears your job see this curtain and there i got to go behind the stage all right and he's like all right here's your job
data/020751.wav|what's drivers no longer work civil servants
data/028662.wav|what they look like like these like these but they're like
data/005674.wav|at the graphs down they got the graphs
data/028227.wav|and eventually because we hard vouch for blur it is decided we need
data/024384.wav|was the two minute cut down so we actually
data/024173.wav|i lupo and tim both cashed out it was
data/003710.wav|take your money but they'll just they'll just outsell you
data/026914.wav|and i have no qualms about it okay next up more celebrities for bmw it's a full
data/021473.wav|but if you believe in it and you want to stick it to the man and you you
data/007714.wav|all i did was smile and give like
data/007968.wav|will be out and then i can actually do more
data/009304.wav|yeah essentially it should be legislated kind of like gambling because it is gambling it activates the same part of your brain as gambling except they can do
data/022986.wav|that is not a good reason to
data/030785.wav|the free drake lyric that's the one you want an explanation on that's the hardest one for you to decipher
data/022655.wav|in the neighborhood for your partner to chase and reminded your parents
data/006827.wav|you should actually and you might be intimidated by starcraft just don't play the multiplayer literally
data/008294.wav|i made a playlist for coffee
data/009822.wav|can go up dramatically here in the good old u.s of a
data/015970.wav|netflix did not make money until probably this this year i want you guys
data/015916.wav|the three lines marketing monday the ability to raise prices is a function of your perceived value netflix is considered very valuable to a
data/003195.wav|it's the pharmaceutical executive who started a ponzi scheme and jacked up the price of drugs martin shkreli he also bought i believe the nft copy of the
data/002694.wav|we're going to roll it one more time we will never walk away
data/028012.wav|improvements and innovation while the war is in full swing you know what i'm going to be honest with this one usually
data/007098.wav|i that's not a joke i might be seeding six
data/003735.wav|i didn't though what was that thing
data/018618.wav|if the for netflix they said yeah just give us a little bit of a cut you can put it online the real
data/028906.wav|stepping me up the stairs step by step
data/007710.wav|if you could reverse men in black a language it's crazy i know exactly what you mean reverse men in black you mean like someone is a flashy thingy and suddenly
data/014470.wav|what of people were telling him to go a certain way a
data/028969.wav|is the american military base in korea in seoul so i would i would travel on skateboard for miles and miles and miles and i would scam buses and and i would get on buses without paying
data/014249.wav|kind of predatory and it's like we're not going
data/001170.wav|terrible business that like had no
data/021191.wav|his cohort of the population which means that in
data/011074.wav|well actually when i think about it just
data/020350.wav|to buy their husband or wife a gift
data/012276.wav|and all i want to do is win this dude i
data/022614.wav|i can't answer trivia questions or play music but ron uses cutting edge ai to do so much more in 18 different
data/002906.wav|charge that will show up if you are
data/016262.wav|if the the game no injuries hasn't missed the
data/020394.wav|well each other the present yeah that sounds really
data/024475.wav|if the day you you fast forward
data/001622.wav|i should have made that thumb
data/013556.wav|it did real well i'm very
data/024759.wav|i think in this past year more than that actually more than a
data/029022.wav|your ass asthma gold beat your ass
data/026468.wav|it's not something i don't use please make one
data/014445.wav|it's not insurmountable but their main thing is just way more broadcasters oh
data/032391.wav|was blasting bad and bougie by
data/017641.wav|verizon spends a lot of money here apple
data/017470.wav|false information about the strike were taken down or or you know attacked by redditors anyway
data/010547.wav|i see it you really hate to see a relapse and you know i'm not going to respond
data/032394.wav|what are you talking to myself kind of slick with it
data/001577.wav|you said it with a smile and a smirk
data/024365.wav|long shot the next ad is by far the most
data/012042.wav|or potential and it's like me and like a
data/016053.wav|i have a company that matches anything take it obviously that's free money
data/024789.wav|and then it's from there it's fun money for you and you just spend it without really knowing the value
data/021732.wav|at my only point of contention it didn't do a good job of of
data/029766.wav|his brother and he just kind of hung out and i remember okay let me tell this
data/032127.wav|scar complains on commentary so much
data/022895.wav|winning this argument and they didn't like throw in a bunch of funny jokes anyway so apple opened with a steve jobs quote and that is a hard quote to beat we're trying to
data/009683.wav|more money i'm not kidding i
data/014016.wav|i still yes yes if there's any bundles
data/024707.wav|in per minute when you're subbed so you can convert your useless
data/022154.wav|come remembered and get your brand their brand entrenched in your brain but i would say in
data/003350.wav|in overdue bills people not paying their bills and
data/006384.wav|congrats for them now it is a little odd that blizzard has pivoted so hard into a
data/015923.wav|what do you think about how streaming services
data/007082.wav|what i'm saying it sounds like i was really nice
data/003168.wav|it's a little farther out and they pivoted the whole company on it
data/026132.wav|and so it went back down again so i don't know i thought
data/004270.wav|yeah my god wait i just figured it out
data/024535.wav|and he said the beginning middle and end and you can get points and that was their definition of a game it was just one of the many quotes that i thought were
data/002763.wav|with us about their stuff to talk about i do have some other stuff to talk about i
data/016306.wav|this new stat number one in the business baby most injuries per employee four times higher than other warehouses in america if you
data/013488.wav|definitely gotten better rack well actually i know definitely gotten better at well actually i know i've gotten better
data/017168.wav|the souls of every character in this short film and find the one represents you tag yourself in the marketing
data/020701.wav|not only that but at least in the commercial you see the process you get the idea
data/023225.wav|and i'm also very aware that i'm getting
data/005249.wav|if the that were just which is which is fine we're just
data/022544.wav|i picked up by a million news articles writing about
data/025216.wav|this week i want to give the first win to cd
data/030861.wav|i can't i can't i can't with this kid i can't with this kid he's like
data/001517.wav|at everyone's had a good positive
data/003910.wav|chance of winning that might run
data/016405.wav|outstanding currency was printed in the past like four years
data/004155.wav|however you never played undertale again therefore
data/022387.wav|what the earth being round i
data/012890.wav|not radio but it was like live streaming with just audio casted starcraft games
data/032410.wav|and this is not a knock it really
data/003800.wav|of the gauntlet okay where you you know you
data/005838.wav|there had been a recent clip a funny
data/031028.wav|are from my tales and sf by the way
data/020057.wav|two billion dollars right now the estimate i've heard is that youtube
data/021579.wav|but you bought it for ten dollars so i can go to the store buy it for five and come back to you and as long as you never know i did that the deal was fine okay
data/005892.wav|because carl jacobs and then he started
data/026456.wav|stop competing he would actually see a significant drop off in subs even though his stream would not change in quality the
data/011791.wav|i think this is it right
data/024907.wav|two things it's very easy to create a loop where they're hooked very quickly next they have a bunch of fallacies now i
data/019503.wav|if you're not like oh i saw a logo of this i'm going to buy it
data/018519.wav|people like adam sandler or production companies
data/011079.wav|we would understand it because you're not as
data/002028.wav|targeted you know what i'm saying i i understand that white people are not in
data/020475.wav|you can get good graphics and a good game on a console and when you buy into the hype over
data/010924.wav|a little higher end factor's more like quick
data/022066.wav|this has happened to me at twitch so i
data/026091.wav|in beings that much what's incredibly sad about it when i
data/016927.wav|kind of crazy some of it was very positive
data/005529.wav|the with my roommate a weed addicted white guy who worked for
data/009837.wav|and uh they're still not they're not
data/012494.wav|much do you want that was cool the cons was it was five thousand dollars for two nights that's the con and the second
data/031005.wav|for most of the thing and then whenever i told him i was staying when when my
data/003124.wav|work there yeah i worked at amazon when it was
data/023738.wav|it's not do that i look at their
data/026336.wav|of the clock is packaging so apple has been an outsize investor in packaging
data/015515.wav|if their strategy it's basically just a hobby it's basically something they do
data/029543.wav|get there we're sitting in the front row
data/018478.wav|i talk about that xbox mall they didn't get
data/015573.wav|if the time when um vaccines
data/020925.wav|hot for a better player from korea right that's probably what it would have been i would have wasted two more years
data/015457.wav|so for example let's go back to spider-man real quick
data/004529.wav|what are the most consistent in saying preaching caution and safety and
data/020472.wav|one the console and a lot of people were hyped
data/014866.wav|we're going to be so good for millennials
data/016842.wav|i am trying to do a deeper amount of research into it to sphere figure out
data/022628.wav|if you're going to be angry enough and remember i didn't even stream at the
data/022182.wav|what an insane commercial a little bit a little bit twisted but remarkably
data/010677.wav|that's the place where we go bloons the boss will push your
data/024213.wav|if just did harry potter for the love of
data/014389.wav|add or whatever and you go to youtube and sub
data/010000.wav|are you guys ready for your music lessons drake gulps beethoven breathes heavily kanye west nods nervously
data/026806.wav|we can't track data on ios and apple still can apple's advertising business is
data/024194.wav|the of their own and uh right
data/002589.wav|the the lesson there was to stick on the
data/018462.wav|will never leave oh my god
data/025382.wav|it is genius it is of course the new esports line of clothing at walmart
data/014923.wav|playing only china who are bad
data/009440.wav|have actually fight in that fight
data/017763.wav|where the highest sub attachment rates on all of
data/013693.wav|and it's a guy who's been
data/031121.wav|and easy to say after the fact but i i've i've always thought
data/013994.wav|at any stage of that process
data/021538.wav|so this is one of the scariest things and i think i can't tell how much of it is real and how much of it is fear-mongering by a well-paid pr machine that is trying to convince people not to invest in gamestop stock but the the worry is that if
data/015102.wav|about like 50. it was a
data/000449.wav|but i love it german won't stop talking about how great it
data/008613.wav|imagine you're an employee of twitter and you're about to be faced with a
data/013245.wav|it's like i love point crawl i love
data/000345.wav|if the then it's playing and we were we were shooting zombies and then dancing and
data/020594.wav|exclusive vip list here today at the marketing monday arena but i have seen so many celebrities right there the rock holy crap you can't see him because our
data/005051.wav|how to get hired at tesla go to an ivy
data/002144.wav|apple thank you for your great contribution you definitely know
data/003884.wav|but you know i think i think
data/018769.wav|bad we really don't know a lot about it
data/011569.wav|i want that watch when i grow up and then i did
data/029876.wav|you there were events where like i was i was
data/017273.wav|dub so quickly it turns out disney's lawyers have gotten their hooks into it and made it very clear that disney's depiction of winnie the pooh is still under copyright only the character from the books has entered the public domain he created this nice little rhyme red shirt on the bear artist beware if
data/022951.wav|so let's just agree on it now and that just shows you how
data/025140.wav|and this guy said hey truck you
data/001442.wav|when dollars off your first five boxes of delicious factory meals
data/007531.wav|this tournament in australia is oh what is what is the joe special

data/007259.wav|i didn't want to do that so it's better that's my opinion but i don't think that's everybody's
data/027405.wav|this past week was uh tax tax week tax day
data/025305.wav|watching mango and i would never consider cutting it's like
data/001414.wav|would love to hear you left
data/002563.wav|the man likes his tails let's see how
data/028877.wav|out and shot glasses in a row i realized oh this is this is not going to be fun and so i did the first 11 while everyone was cheering
data/026367.wav|in the appropriate level of service afterwards greatly increased their chances of
data/027053.wav|if you want to make history you got
data/029895.wav|is that there's like an after party for kings of cali it's actually like at the end of saturday before the final day
data/008448.wav|take a different tactic yeah sigma outside the system exactly i was the goalie in soccer and i would face the goal
data/002205.wav|in the ultimate source of truth uh man facebook is
data/026055.wav|it's alive plug with a penny the girl asked the lexa for a challenge to do plugin a phone charger about halfway into a wall outlet then touch a it's a live plug with a penny the girl asked alexa for a challenge to do
data/017302.wav|isn't that their most famous ones not that big of a day unfortunately most of the good stuff has been
data/013114.wav|two days in a row of good sleep and working out i feel like i'm changing my life
data/025022.wav|and i don't know what to say about that other than
data/004925.wav|i have been absolutely hammered in the wake of this
data/024208.wav|one of the soul is gone if i worked at youtube i
data/020150.wav|imagine if we opened on sundays had to give everyone else like wendy's a chance to make money your mom is a
data/013199.wav|cannot breathe and then i'm going to have that death on my conscience so
data/021667.wav|and of course people aren't like oh my god i
data/014440.wav|thanks they've already won but i think youtube
data/029489.wav|at the disabled people so much and that
data/006400.wav|really love that corporate responsibility yeah
data/010177.wav|as i don't think i can do that without getting banned but that would be very
data/025788.wav|is himself said this i think at this point it's safe to say activision blizzard is the most evil video game company ever this is a picture of the ceo of
data/020523.wav|that i really respected the cost of fixing
data/015754.wav|and so people are kind of abusing
data/025772.wav|if the for week blizzard entertainment has had probably the worst week in the history of its company and riot games
data/021559.wav|mean like i've said it's a complete crap shoot nobody knows what lengths they will go to they could
data/026635.wav|now let's rescale this chart with the value of sony as a company and remember i said microsoft
data/023358.wav|a great competition customers win so it's
data/011336.wav|everything everywhere all at once oh i've heard it's so good i definitely i need to see that
data/019605.wav|music was supposed to be a huge part of the campaign but no one can wrap their heads around how to make these five syllables into something musical so they first called in but stewart
data/021608.wav|talk about the actual interesting things the ads unfortunately i have some unfortunate news for you the ads were not that great this year but through
data/008005.wav|one in seven billion yeah not
data/028146.wav|if the thing to say but i think in 2022 we
data/024104.wav|well consider it so um this past week the cmo
data/023572.wav|some thoughts for you and helped
data/015620.wav|was is one of the most demanded streaming
data/026508.wav|universally in that in that binary
data/027260.wav|what the brand has caused gamers to think and so i found a study on this i found
data/002692.wav|love that for you and you know what though there is no penalty you could just walk away just just checking you don't feel like walking away do you
data/025221.wav|announced because we need it out fast
data/016653.wav|actually the biggest company after 10 years ever
data/027214.wav|it on pace to be bigger than all these by far and on the contrary games that have adopted more traditional methods of being quote unquote triple a are in fact struggling horizon forbidden west which has the terrible distinction of launching their first game around
data/030730.wav|i got married yet i just proposed actually outplayed wow what is
data/009684.wav|on the dotted line today i'm not kidding i locked that
data/009450.wav|it's mr p set it up for saudi arabia
data/008280.wav|let's say five ten more minutes just
data/026100.wav|anyway whatever it is it all seems really cool it all seems really cool let me do one more we're
data/024115.wav|experience for you yeah so this is a major win what a
data/009895.wav|when i started talking about exposing the secrets of billionaires i
data/013787.wav|just don't look too closely it could have been you maybe someone in chat made it
data/023277.wav|look at the label and she
data/014929.wav|in a monday but we can't transition from wins and fails to the actual show without a
data/025456.wav|as of your help earlier with my thumbnail but the ones that actually are well guess what here's the fail everyone that's not doesn't have an opportunity to get involved in this sick internship i found to get this internship that my
data/009092.wav|i mean my youtube history here we go wait hold wait oh yeah this is it here's one i mean my youtube history here we go wait hold wait oh yeah this is it here's one right now okay i got it um i got it i got it i got it i got it i
data/024412.wav|of a big multinational corporation i love this i love paying
data/022853.wav|it's so duped because he said like he said
data/017811.wav|if you learned a little thing or two about way to think about marketing through the clock model and
data/009299.wav|i think a way to be able
data/018913.wav|of dreamworks right and dreamworks did hit the kids he did found dreamworks all right he has a pedigree he worked on
data/000673.wav|if the day we had a good time but but he lost i mean if i had to guess if i had a guest total he probably went from 4 or
data/028893.wav|and i'm like let's dance and i would just pick her up and
data/031625.wav|but i do remember one thing that's the reason i brought this story up
data/020183.wav|and this is such a powerful mental image
data/025159.wav|it's week with a brand new
data/029761.wav|well yeah the big three it's been a whirlwind
data/004778.wav|indeed a guarantee them with cash which would mean
data/015250.wav|as these big churn spikes once their top
data/029790.wav|and i got to see it
data/021069.wav|was forgettable and the ad is forgettable the
data/010851.wav|is cringe and then if you on on on wider scale may be team i was very annoying but for me it's you me because you me is is cringe and then if you on on a wider scale maybe timo is very annoying but
data/010858.wav|i think of themselves as yasuo i do agree with
data/020126.wav|word for word the tendency was to be a bit overly formal stuffy i'm sorry
data/015604.wav|into stuff for like ultra wealthy and then
data/005700.wav|i i get to talking to
data/012086.wav|so but what's cool is like
data/017953.wav|is great but to make a seamless delivery and online service order they were way way better
data/007169.wav|no no that is not where i am that's not where i'm going with this okay that's not the that's not the stance
data/020456.wav|but no one can argue that this has been
data/029226.wav|i like behind the scenes you know behind the stage
data/012014.wav|the first day because again there's like
data/024152.wav|are they would have made a lot more money it's
data/020824.wav|holy guys i did not expect this oh my
data/002765.wav|in the worlds of marketing and business
data/029505.wav|and for example we talked about that a little moment
data/017405.wav|it's right there it's just one of the images and because it looks similar enough the people writing just
data/031851.wav|the thousands of employees puts on a gigantic production with a massive budget 15 casters
data/025108.wav|war and they don't like and i found that to be they are the only brands that could have that low of a score and stay in business because they have a
data/029125.wav|the praise it you can see it at my logs i go into the little the channel mike the praise it you can see it in my logs i go into the
data/016745.wav|way to make meat sustainable is like the best
data/001901.wav|know about is that twitch makes way less than youtube for me you know like twitch twitch is like
data/015008.wav|so yeah they're done but now let's let's
data/027133.wav|big pile of infinite money and the banks
data/014531.wav|is that and he said a lot of wise things he said something that blew me away with its wisdom and
data/019722.wav|astronomically crazy and the product they're offering
data/012514.wav|if you had like a family of four you could fit in there or you
data/004849.wav|i just started stealing content which he's done for a while but
data/028311.wav|at yourself he's a legend he has a
data/010823.wav|if the game i play that's that's
data/008867.wav|watching them on twitter on their own platform is not good pr
data/001500.wav|why are you wearing green do you always wear your favorite color every day are you a cartoon character
data/029604.wav|the old mall and built a new
data/024537.wav|i mean that did get through this is the one pierce in apple's armor
data/006566.wav|so sony's building space lasers and you know i know they're
data/027541.wav|read the reactions from either side nobody will say like i love twitter the way it was nobody's like twitter's so perfect now
data/020775.wav|great ads to choose from we've reviewed
data/014343.wav|in the first is going to be in a major advantage
data/028169.wav|a whopping 3 million dollars in salary per
data/027931.wav|avatar nobody who got fired by you
data/009790.wav|from the largest real estate companies are doing that but not some don't have to do
data/025317.wav|super glad you guys all and you've created real value
data/031076.wav|started hanging out with we started watching a
data/002240.wav|at well i know somebody has because
data/032149.wav|as don't know that also don't stream so you're not
data/008984.wav|i think so there should be something there should
data/001463.wav|he gets there you picked two of the worst people i
data/015273.wav|was combined full of amazing stuff crap stuff
data/008779.wav|like it's everything's out of the window everything's different you know it's just
data/025120.wav|they could ever make you want all
data/008908.wav|talk to pay the musician by the way hey update
data/000622.wav|brought up the watches were the
data/000246.wav|one time when i'm actually cheering i get a tap on the shoulder and i think it's because i'm cheering too loud i think someone behind
data/008751.wav|board of directors for a company works for the shareholders like little old me even though
data/005408.wav|make something like that because it's like it's not just one and done it feels like it
data/022859.wav|and you never said you don't like a stock you always
data/017858.wav|a lot of games like battlefield is a great example the battlefield has amazing trailers battlefield will will make you think the
data/015982.wav|was just trying to do that's what
data/027084.wav|the deal and this is why it's probably good that we do this now when you hear the words inflation or you hear something like interest rates it's very easy for your brain to be like this i think a lot of times these terms are designed and
data/018784.wav|pretty series card and play games the way they're meant to be played so hopefully that helped you guys
data/029405.wav|we stan a mom that that covers uh debts
data/012254.wav|this is later that is like hours later that kid runs out of nowhere
data/032430.wav|and change your ways thank you
data/018861.wav|well this ad I gotta go I'm
data/012508.wav|also i've lost way more than
data/004374.wav|like if i wanted to i could see a
data/025572.wav|to waste time the biggest wins and fails this week came from one company formerly known as facebook first i'm
data/019030.wav|i have mental health issues to make her more relatable to gen z that
data/006713.wav|i showed my dog who's named maya on the
data/009852.wav|to like the average amount of people that will be there
data/021138.wav|it's already off to an interesting start there's good reason for my glistening skin and how i shine
data/021080.wav|i more condoms than you guys let's be real
data/032260.wav|you know just like a little
data/018883.wav|a solution to my problems and escape from
data/029712.wav|i get a little bit like oh i'm kind of nice
data/016373.wav|using fake ids to apply for loans for fake businesses they texted about the cash that was available you need to apply
data/011772.wav|pimply teenager lanky guy who's from now
data/026395.wav|well saying dear iphone users please don't forget that a green bubble is a real person the green and blue bubble
data/026624.wav|i've been thinking about production for 2022
data/018888.wav|i love watching I love talking about ads and I
data/017701.wav|when people and 90 percent of them said they
data/019963.wav|wasn't really hitting disney animation was fading and it was hurting the whole company disney was really like sliding into a possible irrelevancy and he was worried because the things that were doing
data/007298.wav|so throughout now the first set that
data/009287.wav|grab mindset in some way you
data/000702.wav|i don't want to leak his last name but
data/022049.wav|and every brand has tried to do it we've gotten a little more jaded we've gotten a little bit more like wow this is super cringe and you're just
data/026200.wav|boring preamble to what will probably be a good movie the second dude will be fire the first
data/025090.wav|the nfl is one of the most hated brands now again it's similar to gamers
data/015534.wav|you'll get this diamond encrusted apple watch okay like i even put modern
data/006880.wav|watch this story but one of the senior vps i was sitting down next to him at evo at a blackjack table
data/003607.wav|the uh i'm a recent grad i live
data/016234.wav|i actually a kind of a stacked wins
data/002378.wav|get near it but i came close
data/003662.wav|after pepper and it's great and everyone loves it and then one
data/012540.wav|thanks again for your help earlier today or what
data/013476.wav|the sure of tom hardy saying he's a millionaire
data/022030.wav|well say so there was also the um
data/019693.wav|we can we can you know
data/016877.wav|if you go by age this this orange
data/016523.wav|one every tournament in every game
data/007765.wav|never happened before but i'm literally
data/003461.wav|that's the reason it needs to stay open and uh not
data/011922.wav|if you want to spend five racks or your family does if you're
data/031140.wav|he only made three thousand dollars which is a flagrant it's a technical foul it's a red card it's ridic it's ridiculous
data/002865.wav|at which could be massive and it is looking like that is a
data/003345.wav|no matter what the economic report comes out on thursday the fact is is that since things have gotten more expensive there is a lot of evidence
data/027040.wav|this is definitely the most expensive overall for what they're selling
data/026904.wav|well it's usually has a pretty good idea of what
data/016494.wav|things are going to do better if you are
data/016303.wav|annie monday topic which i will get to but we can't skip the
data/016450.wav|it will force people back into the workforce it it's disgusting
data/018838.wav|i don't forget your smile when
data/014523.wav|my own thoughts and opinions but mischief
data/007566.wav|we roasting him about not knowing whatever
data/022211.wav|his daughter good i mean i actually don't know what doc morris is but i assume if it's just healthcare that's pretty fair if they sold
data/030900.wav|she had more than one cup of pooty and
data/026623.wav|yes know this was not this was not on
data/001088.wav|you're welcome found out about you a week ago cheers from brazil tell tell the people of brazil about me okay get it get it get that get that trending
data/022408.wav|despite still being funny and being one of the least skipped out ever
data/013155.wav|it's no one's gonna watch it's
data/006108.wav|not everyone watches melee i should've
data/000982.wav|that's what the question implies and the
data/019170.wav|doing that so they're they're really leading into other things
data/028866.wav|that's very cultured of me i just don't know what it means it means personal choice yeah i guess that makes sense yeah i
data/010458.wav|i used to be a big chatter during monkey ball now i'm a lurker
data/015988.wav|good for consumers in the long run but in the short term we get a lot of
data/019591.wav|we can bridge the gap here
data/026152.wav|somebody this week melted down a
data/000402.wav|fucking amazing we have this plan where we're
data/030587.wav|france obviously how do you answer how do you answer i haven't played
data/012335.wav|dude they're just like easy mode chopsticks they're not galactic grabbers even in the world of star wars no one would call those galactic grabbers
data/009830.wav|well as the first electric car
data/002327.wav|what is going to be so much fun how much
data/007672.wav|how's everybody doing you know how you
data/010971.wav|right here let's see what we're getting into here
data/007351.wav|is the sheik that was probably
data/028565.wav|entire lump sum as income like
data/015438.wav|so i just put the i just put the
data/016619.wav|are the number of babies being born is uh
data/018551.wav|literally owned by microsoft that is so funny
data/029080.wav|of like spending all my day on
data/029645.wav|india with smoke coming up from his
data/015241.wav|okay this black line right here is is
data/019194.wav|hard it fell through in a way that made Sony actually really mad at
data/023821.wav|dominant so i'll watch one more
data/028084.wav|it's keynote speeches steve jobs has ever
data/003830.wav|right now it's used for a lot of misinformation so maybe i
data/014182.wav|if they make you do as you
data/023983.wav|they are stupid for other reasons that
data/009294.wav|you know the developers just don't care about the rest of us people that can avoid them they just make the game get a bunch of players and then harvest the
data/005115.wav|well it couldn't hurt you know frame
data/031381.wav|the boat we show up and this boat is like
data/004756.wav|secured against his tesla stock that was
data/019168.wav|yeah it's not close and if you're the underdog in marketing you have to find a way to be distinct you cannot yes and you cannot be
data/018563.wav|right as some of the greatest
data/030352.wav|i just kind of realized like you
data/023561.wav|we value is lower than that price
data/010645.wav|you know what no there is
data/016883.wav|people places like twitch are seeing massive growth and so people that are creators for the digital economy
data/011493.wav|it's still safe to say can
data/017853.wav|my god it's hot in here
data/023444.wav|a business or even think about your own personal brand you should think about the word margin brand should just be a fancy word for the word margin okay so let me start with the three lines and
data/025840.wav|well that made the movie people made
data/019896.wav|on your mom's ipad is not good this game is not good and it certainly is not living up to what they promised it's
data/024613.wav|his brother that's the coolest kids in school bar
data/006649.wav|like i've been saying at least
data/019514.wav|the subway because they couldn't raise their prices with inflation so what they did
data/020493.wav|if the only thing they've made let me just show you this is it this is every game
data/005834.wav|but i was sitting next to him so i was talking to him the most and he claimed that he
data/005817.wav|i mean look i was talking
data/003244.wav|in books the answer is yes what if you could own a stake in harry potter what if a book series functioned like a
data/002131.wav|no shot i mean yang might
data/031008.wav|i got him i just got
data/012057.wav|it was cringe should be your shielder
data/000156.wav|during the bachelor party and it's a movie it's crazy i mean it's
data/027832.wav|it's a profit on everything sold now
data/030692.wav|next day i'm at recess and i hear some some
data/002344.wav|will be like listen it's i
data/004578.wav|but i have to use these cursed wired headphones
data/001650.wav|literally 30 years i didn't like cats
data/004757.wav|was the idea and then right
data/023031.wav|because they don't even take 30 percent of my
data/017255.wav|the billions of dollars without actually
data/024825.wav|is that you need to be able to get
data/018778.wav|this generation and now i'm pretty confident
data/010675.wav|effing doing i want to see what's happening
data/023522.wav|where your cost you can lower your cost
data/003200.wav|martin shkreli turned a new leaf and he's
data/015658.wav|it all the streaming services the biggest winners the biggest upside prime and netflix
data/031029.wav|with me at the end of that
data/026862.wav|game right now literally like one of the most loved people in america she's killing it
data/002016.wav|and so i get entrenched like i stick my
data/026164.wav|ever since they first heard about diablo mobile they've been saying we have phones blizzard why don't you never know
data/016304.wav|feels without giving a w to the best in the business jeff bezos and amazon baby okay
data/007068.wav|i've never been like i said i've never been
data/010968.wav|you know even if we don't have a trailer i kind of want to watch one
data/020942.wav|is often the best choice there is too many people drag
data/017206.wav|it's very difficult to sleep when you can't breathe through your nose and he it's very difficult to sleep when you can't breathe through your nose and you can't breathe well through your mouth
data/020034.wav|because he thinks vr is the only thing that can break away from how much google owns phones this is
data/003036.wav|no real information and it's definitely like not not cool that we all are
data/006546.wav|well business so they're getting it in
data/018658.wav|and before that i did content marketing management for twitch i was a marketer twitch and i'm a marketer
data/018814.wav|if the corporate zombie suits and Apple as the
data/010293.wav|well would probably gonna ask him to be a captain
data/010292.wav|they try to i think if i ask
data/008326.wav|what everything's kind of normal i think that's the indicator if channel
data/027486.wav|what twitter so i got twitter and i got this is
data/025921.wav|well this because they started to
data/009203.wav|but i guess what you should do is practice
data/000223.wav|in my life so it's worse i should have just sam adams ludwig i should have copied because now i
data/030017.wav|you're saying it'll prove your point that there's a lot of like
data/017960.wav|probably one of the best days i've had in
data/010425.wav|read your sub message if i get it with the if
data/028747.wav|at the stadium and he drives me
data/019304.wav|i know we haven't spoken do you still have
data/026108.wav|if the for their own rights when they were offered a three cent raise which was you know absurd a three
data/024291.wav|they all drive jaguars at the end i think it's necessary i think the goal of a
data/022566.wav|and never ever miss a day of practice again not now
data/030686.wav|and then we had a big
data/006407.wav|yeah it's basically a total disaster
data/020714.wav|get into that back half of the awards starting with
data/006543.wav|things like offer financial services to
data/032246.wav|i the last 10 hands went
data/016075.wav|it's a long time industry staple and it appears to be a recreational fluid the next personal case study
data/028382.wav|so my resources from another project to this
data/013340.wav|and then i put them because they wouldn't fit in
data/001748.wav|like he doesn't believe him he
data/018496.wav|dollars let's get a bit of a comparison going on here to some even larger numbers that i was put this
data/013125.wav|do you think game pass will ever go on
data/015512.wav|this guy do you remember this guy this is apple tv
data/020700.wav|part of your brain that uses visual memory is that it's disgusting what a truly
data/001896.wav|but i currently don't entirely due to laziness
data/017351.wav|oh yeah yeah that's a good one
data/024453.wav|at the foot long and just
data/017738.wav|example of the clock model again the
data/012532.wav|that's my overall review end of the day i think disney didn't steal my
data/000395.wav|if the germa we're talking about future streams he's got
data/007133.wav|i don't know it was it was
data/007799.wav|and then i open with that the camera's
data/018068.wav|he cannot catch a break this
data/025127.wav|just depressing okay i'm not i don't want
data/030265.wav|we the weirdest look and he's like
data/007638.wav|a nice little seven hour vod
data/016737.wav|and i think if they continue to make progress and
data/014280.wav|well friends i switch over pokey okay cool
data/029111.wav|seen before you start and i'm like yeah so before i've even done any work i'm up in tahoe
data/029534.wav|and he's wearing a suit for the first time i think i've seen him on commentary
data/013455.wav|the city of atlanta cannot say otherwise i have never ever
data/005846.wav|and i saw in his eyes dude i'm not stupid it was a top clip
data/010780.wav|but this is a bigger tragedy than the
data/006429.wav|for a deep run in the wilderness in old school
data/030100.wav|and you could talk to your pikachu and control it you could say hey you pikachu um use
data/024763.wav|in a single day 15 million for song lee 9
data/006821.wav|yeah and if you haven't watched season
data/016058.wav|i'm sorry somebody said they used a truck as their marketing
data/018905.wav|you can flip your phone and get a different screen the phone plays in vertical and horizontal what a brilliant idea what a brilliant idea now let me talk to you let me talk to you about the two people making this claim
data/001401.wav|and and if there's one thing
data/025549.wav|they should have an effective way to leverage it
data/015360.wav|whatever your tax amount is and save it from your bank account as your money comes in and that
data/030777.wav|well you're like god my one time and he's like well
data/024850.wav|with friends okay this is the most common
data/010455.wav|and i think i got some good
data/016870.wav|be a dystopia and we really don't have any idea
data/023002.wav|with the epic is is not innocent because as much as epic talks about this being for the good of everyone and how important it is for small developers that's only the case now after they secretly tried to get a special side deal from apple apple
data/004989.wav|just floundering in all directions for public support
data/004080.wav|okay you can put a spin on it you don't have
data/009357.wav|did better than the video of me actually doing it the first time so it's like in a way he gave me a lot of free content
data/006367.wav|in the mouth of rolling for it it's
data/029557.wav|yeah whatever no one's saying this makes you
data/024817.wav|free to play against the ceo of a mobile
data/026376.wav|the highest nps scores which is a net promoter score a chance of someone recommending the brand after
data/011651.wav|not know what it's like you
data/025824.wav|don't play it just because you watched
data/027379.wav|scale to the big size and then when they get big they're more likely to crack down on it and they can use the power they have to force the people that made the content before to make stuff on their platform
data/028522.wav|it's jail time and so i like
data/007428.wav|so i didn't stand up during the
data/002984.wav|i took up my phone and i'm like is this part of
data/004357.wav|we're in that you thought your best way to contribute in chat to our conversation was to put the bee emoji
data/009762.wav|that's what happens they do that the rest of the
data/028254.wav|people that work at all those companies so you
data/019813.wav|it might even be wrong it's no man's sky okay
data/008657.wav|it's of throwing out the entire contract because at the end of the day the contract kind
data/000920.wav|antelope never picked anything he just said
data/028752.wav|in california had to move back home to colorado and when i moved home to colorado i get
data/022812.wav|is on planet earth at this
data/006282.wav|you guys may have noticed that for most of the day
data/025581.wav|in my friends through the first few months of the pandemic that's awesome if you enjoyed that mark i think you'll be excited that we're partnering with vertigo on five more great games from deep silver and others we'll share more
data/031989.wav|yesterday blur came up to me and said hey ludwig how do you become a full-time twitch streamer blur you worked at twitch for five years what did you do blur you look like you
data/013414.wav|i ever the fans maybe i missed some
data/003360.wav|i only say this to keep people informed
data/021390.wav|what market value was at but right around here the shorts started getting so severe and they were doing a lot of things to pressure the stock to go down okay and it got more and more shorted and they got more and more money and they got
data/015020.wav|if the this netflix let's talk about
data/018649.wav|so nobody's acquired discord yet discord is the hottest acquisition i would think among anyone trying to build a whole ecosystem in the gaming space
data/022861.wav|in the first people to turn negative on amazon that was the one example
data/004558.wav|ask you to do and that is dive yourself
data/029427.wav|i mean i get the vibe that didn't go super
data/011019.wav|playful guys you play fall guys are you playing
data/025880.wav|all the resentment that's been building
data/023256.wav|well maybe it was time to
data/022078.wav|that would be funny or relatable from maybe like basic white girl account but not funny from chase bank a multi-billion dollar
data/001572.wav|okay i got a question for you
data/018726.wav|yes maybe one day in the future google stadia and streaming games on xbox
data/029502.wav|the right where they just show like there's levels here right and scar talks about it in this dock he
data/004696.wav|one second wait what's your take on who that denying the penis man allegations i don't have a take on that one haven't
data/024417.wav|with all three are you putting them all together that's what i want to see so that's my first
data/017156.wav|you can just say mid by the way i don't need to know that it's high key
data/006000.wav|i played mail with him and i thought that
data/019995.wav|his price of marvel itself they bought marvel for
data/024766.wav|the be ready for number one a bonus for first time
data/029627.wav|which kind of explains some of the
data/031487.wav|two decades and compared to even like
data/000518.wav|the group cause we have that big group of ten just
data/020943.wav|if the poor odds of success far too long i like this idea it can be taken the wrong way like if you have a new year's resolution to go to the gym more giving up
data/029283.wav|indeed mondays are kind of the two big things
data/003117.wav|is that amazon is one of the best resume builder companies you go there you do a couple
data/028064.wav|this video of a girl getting an ipod for christmas in
data/026460.wav|way to think about marketing that is way more holistic and way more
data/004623.wav|whole portfolio so i can copy and
data/027153.wav|which is where they're in this real
data/011475.wav|yeah i think it's i think this happens to all a lot of people it's a very
data/019766.wav|under hype is is irrelevance no one buys it overhype means people
data/014097.wav|i want to show you guys but i don't want to leak anything else
data/014392.wav|than anyone can swap over and keep their
data/001847.wav|it's not much of a grind it would be a fun routing exercise i'm
data/031609.wav|and so i was there just just absorbing
data/019171.wav|leading into the promise of Halo and
data/008510.wav|what's that the market was already starting to dip because everyone's like wait a minute
data/024516.wav|you didn't even notice us adding this new payment
data/001023.wav|at dogs and the first three
data/020800.wav|if the games though i'll tell you that
data/012582.wav|you got four dollars of disney or whatever whatever and so i was doing
data/016189.wav|what kind of eyelash extensions do you use
data/000071.wav|i almost hope it was the first year because now we're
data/013776.wav|i do they have harassment abuse
data/021535.wav|even if we get them it's
data/017698.wav|the becoming deeply embedded in the apple ecosystem and buying again
data/011606.wav|to agree i don't like everyone
data/001913.wav|is it worth it i do charge him like a 50 cent fee
data/008141.wav|and that's probably illegal some sort of game off some sort of balloons off
data/006349.wav|the past two three weeks of wins and fails starting with a very very very
data/018441.wav|add service talked about but i am quite certain knowing nintendo they will do absolutely everything wrong but one
data/027654.wav|it goes private and just starts bleeding
data/017642.wav|apple shifted it down here they spend nine million dollars nine to twelve million dollars opening
data/010702.wav|yeah we're mr b shows up and says i will give you a
data/018990.wav|are lost jobs and so the the
data/016211.wav|an ad and a crypto ad
data/001755.wav|we're checking out version of the
data/015251.wav|i show ends they might get a hit here and
data/028355.wav|and marcus man is furious but he has
data/011062.wav|you know i don't have i don't have as many
data/011716.wav|i'm not gonna be able to find it
data/028010.wav|one of them wins it's gonna be
data/031564.wav|tactic failed and now he's in kill mode now he turns it on
data/009339.wav|i get invited to mr b stuff
data/014592.wav|there are never going to lose face they're always
data/009786.wav|let me check is that what 70
data/000523.wav|of course so ludwig is in the room alone
data/005780.wav|is up behind me and sees me happen to open
data/002041.wav|i hate boba and i have crucifix earrings
data/021485.wav|they still have to that's what
data/017700.wav|use the genius bar which is millions million
data/029162.wav|and eventually i could get like i could get past erica i got so good i
data/004314.wav|we can make fun of them
data/004599.wav|big day for people who have been waiting for my seven month
data/011720.wav|okay this is it wait let me
data/004573.wav|if he had i would have made more money but i sold knowing that it wouldn't happen
data/027060.wav|i just feels odd oh yeah yeah yeah okay
data/027337.wav|when they beat it but often their
data/005639.wav|it was totally fun had a good time um we
data/017260.wav|we can make an impact around here
data/002951.wav|billion dollar budget uh massive directors
data/015648.wav|about getting a big streaming service but i don't think it's going to work it's not
data/031605.wav|the world's largest land event it's the world's largest
data/023467.wav|but margin wise ford takes about eight to ten thousand dollars of plastic and steel and computer parts and makes a car and sells it for about eight
data/008897.wav|tells them what to do and
data/002768.wav|else and then after that i don't
data/015149.wav|it'll stranger things everything off of debt and they're just hoping that they can get big enough to get out of that and one of the best examples of that working by the way is their stock price which is you can't even see that dip anymore this remember the
data/009973.wav|and here's why i should be a contender
data/003417.wav|that china is demanding be cancelled
data/003488.wav|unless stuff we talked about today
data/000566.wav|big stack of money we have go down
data/002914.wav|dramatically they used to not care one of the big advantages that netflix has had for a long time was that
data/032090.wav|all the rest of his allotted
data/015526.wav|i mean that everyone else is doing it they don't really have a purpose no i'm not being
data/031723.wav|erie craft the ending you know what i mean can we find you know what i mean what if
data/022275.wav|and that was pretty terrible honestly
data/030631.wav|i dunno if i want to enter it kind
data/010053.wav|an album with the flag on the front that is literally eminem's album with
data/022269.wav|the thai commercials have the decency to pay for three minutes
data/000743.wav|the drinks and we go to bed probably around three because we have a flight pretty
data/018372.wav|you feel better about your job but if your job yeah quantifiable your job needs to be quantifiable in
data/004588.wav|what up every time you guys think it's spectrum
data/029205.wav|i was not really not as much
data/002676.wav|ten dollars added up i need a little music for this i need a little
data/015744.wav|where's that money you promised where's the growth and now
data/011582.wav|at a nice restaurant watching you help motivate me to try harder thank you sir
data/016259.wav|it's not one not one time so here's a stat breakdown for the
data/028634.wav|of getting closer i'm getting closer i'm getting closer
data/007490.wav|i don't even know what it was it had no meat in it it had no carbs in it it was just like a weird
data/001331.wav|yeah it's just a fun little hut that i built out here using only primitive tools
data/019937.wav|i don't include that number 10 of the
data/022161.wav|that ad tested off the charts i mean
data/029069.wav|no neither one of us yeah that friend's name floyd mayweather jr aka curtis yeah i beat his ass
data/026102.wav|actually there's no actual picket line at night but the striking
data/000105.wav|someone said listen streamer and plus wedding i'm proud to announce
data/014878.wav|phil spencer who runs the xbox division
data/005513.wav|and definitely plenty plenty of plenty of problems with the gas prices
data/001521.wav|we ask you a question that's
data/015072.wav|if they have no competition they have everything and
data/013817.wav|we look at the comments the comments are crazy the comments are full of sony copium i i've
data/020178.wav|the for forget all they tried to
data/001580.wav|if you're still peppa i can hear you
data/023883.wav|rising up and killing us all that's more of a meme i'm worried about you know if if they get this complex once this gets cheaper
data/028750.wav|your boy is in by the way i don't end up
data/027583.wav|that's what olive garden makes twitter is
data/030953.wav|that is not the word you
data/031594.wav|the game is so old but it is it is the most beautiful i mean it's a crazy game i when i was
data/027179.wav|march 7th let's talk about our topic so
data/012793.wav|keep the team together stanz would say nice things and like
data/013408.wav|look like he's got a youthful boyish spirit to him you know what i'm saying this is the one case i believe this is a rare moment this is the one case where an animated character would have been better voiced by chris pratt
data/031143.wav|something and he had done a subathon and
data/005506.wav|really really yeah it was actually the people that are um that
data/015838.wav|okay cable is extremely old so it's
data/027600.wav|the tweet no shot he said today

data/010618.wav|stevens my new coach by the way i have some
data/021957.wav|the company no one else can do it
data/010966.wav|it looks like a minion and win a bunch of stuff
data/020094.wav|he's forced out of the company and he ends up
data/021630.wav|is that was actually pretty solid again
data/010431.wav|all invited and all show up and so i thought
data/017308.wav|that's just a new piece of information
data/010765.wav|individual chatters are not stupid as individuals if i ever like single someone out there
data/028876.wav|yeah yeah yeah of course i could do that and
data/020759.wav|hopefully getting you broken up into
data/009867.wav|europe is not walkable i disagree the cities for sure
data/028013.wav|where if it's a win i'll say a fail if it's a
data/024927.wav|progressing in in games in general you can have a skill game based game you can
data/013873.wav|that was an amazing show it's a genius business idea it was very forward looking and it's paying massive that it was an amazing show it's a genius business idea
data/022370.wav|it's not actually as we watch i want
data/010829.wav|with lyric ludwig and stanz as my squad truly
data/025591.wav|you simply have to check this out
data/010631.wav|took notes like i was in class
data/023689.wav|they gave the people four options the
data/003021.wav|here you can see it right here this is the
data/012888.wav|troll my linkedin and then ask me questions
data/024768.wav|i do this is because once you've put in
data/018832.wav|it's halftime and his team was down and he thinks back to the last game where he had to eat this
data/016085.wav|give me some data what is it how is it doing
data/010909.wav|it comes first and we understand that while we may love minions rise of groom we can't wait to
data/031446.wav|the waves are like sloshing stands
data/007911.wav|one of them which is just mommy with a bunch of
data/000349.wav|there was this game there called killer
data/010282.wav|okay uh so today we'll probably do
data/000284.wav|your rooms than we know what to do with
data/004247.wav|i have you heard that bank of china is preventing people
data/012069.wav|do you remember my name and like
data/031974.wav|which brings me to blur dude everyone
data/022011.wav|that's what the internet is the internet is the bully and you are trying to do some kind of wordplay creative it
data/019882.wav|is still great fable is a good game that is why when i tell you that it's one of the most overhyped games of all time
data/011431.wav|nine months the king is back dude i'm back baby i'm streaming so what's cool is this week a lot of people from the big end nvidia are on vacation
data/006376.wav|about pay to win free to play and pricing in

data/019663.wav|well remember how it goes so right then and there i got a piece of
data/018977.wav|imagine short form quick videos great for wasting time on your phone in and out whenever you want they don't have to pay to make the content the users make the content for free and it's imagine short form quick videos great for wasting time on your phone in and out whenever you want they don't even have to pay to make the content the users make the content for
data/018456.wav|and she doesn't know anything about gaming or streaming or anything but she knows i worked at twitch
data/021711.wav|not be easy but it'll be amazing toyota proud partner of team usa this ad is the type of
data/014801.wav|is because people were signing up for it
data/025798.wav|the show since the launch of squid game to
data/026738.wav|was different subjects metaverse has essentially become
data/018887.wav|is where my favorite streams to do I love
data/007063.wav|thank you i hope you enjoyed um
data/000435.wav|we don't we do not miss uh like
data/004046.wav|woke up early for a meeting and i was doing work and then i worked i just feel like
data/016999.wav|you know what reading's kind of like
data/026588.wav|i sit there and the second starts talking
data/020860.wav|i stream the degree helps the degree helps and i
data/012003.wav|are so committed that it does make it kind of
data/018617.wav|other people's content and those studios didn't know the value of their content on streaming so they
data/014831.wav|we're all their games they sold exactly 15 probably some of
data/031627.wav|and this guy moon this guy got second place this guy lost to huck and he was just sitting there on the edge of the bed sad just drinking sadly because he was the first person
data/010061.wav|as i might even get an intro made for smart
data/026928.wav|there's nothing no probably makes you
data/016291.wav|with his profile is all like wordle
data/015752.wav|that is the big consumer change that's the future we're headed to is that customers are getting more savvy about abusing free trials and one month payments to buy everything because if you think about it look if i want to
data/003632.wav|i guess that's good that's better the i guess that's good that's better than her outliving you man
data/026795.wav|is losing both they they are they are hated by most people they have a terrible brand like their brand is sort of in the dumpster and they have a hard time making massive acquisitions because they've already bought you know instagram whatsapp whatever they
data/019662.wav|with you forget the melody and
data/020473.wav|wait for this game to be good on console
data/031952.wav|if the people didn't believe me
data/031838.wav|the right i said it right yeah if it's red it's
data/011300.wav|i feel like sometimes with that
data/000980.wav|that if i were to take a break from it i would need to find a replacement it was that important and that if i were taking a break and did need a
data/029251.wav|his nickname because he's also like a battery
data/007857.wav|i don't get it what does monday mean
data/011497.wav|or clown mask for a little bit so they could sell it it
data/009992.wav|of himself doing it let alone doing it uh
data/028289.wav|he is actually a character he
data/011949.wav|with the halls everyone's supposed to
data/012948.wav|over the next year and a half of all time and
data/009257.wav|if the two months macintosh think of the 11.
data/015667.wav|the safest bet though is probably disney because you can't really bet against the biggest movies in the world for the past 10 years
data/011471.wav|the very human reaction of like when someone you're close to gets something
data/018443.wav|i think i've explained a lot gonna talk about one per person the elephant in the i think i've explained a lot i'm gonna talk about one more person
data/004341.wav|see pickle rick and i'm i've on the floor dude and he's just laughing like you will and must control himself and he see pickle rick and i'm i'm on the floor dude and he's just laughing

data/017289.wav|every monthly bill so i told christopher robin that anyone can
data/003217.wav|it cuts the owners would and then
data/026664.wav|let me try to explain this guy's business style because it's not good leadership and it's not smart and it's it wasn't good for the company overall but he does find ways to get paid so first example was the overwatch league there's a smaller scale but it's going
data/023945.wav|if the things that are controversial getting attention and then feeding off in a more creative way it's just uh it's just smart
data/011796.wav|taking off right and then you
data/009154.wav|and then i lose money because it has

data/011204.wav|too late king too late sorry buddy but you'll never get the nft on the back
data/009141.wav|if the three months of elon musk
data/024672.wav|know exactly how this is gonna
data/030103.wav|the literally bond like this is going to be the friend that i need because we moved a lot as a
data/027102.wav|for hundreds of years and eventually the whole damn roman empire collapsed and then this guy tries to get
data/002971.wav|minor spoiler is that you know the whatever the horror bad guy thing is in nope it can turn off
data/031443.wav|and he keeps going down there and as he gets like i
data/008451.wav|you played basketball with no hands that's bold that's a ball take
data/013700.wav|fail for twitter shareholders including myself i'm bummed i thought
data/010825.wav|paper mario is not mellow paper mario is a chat based horror game
data/029165.wav|at the hours to do it
data/009524.wav|so squishy and so slow she dies so easy the thing that new players mess up at league is not pressing the buttons there's only four
data/005814.wav|i think he's actually done some funny stuff recently he did the casting of the cup
data/020256.wav|about family and love and where things are going and connection and friendship and we're thinking of all
data/012369.wav|i was talking to the bartender and she's like listen i heard you have a
data/011809.wav|in the first scene i see i go out and it's
data/020972.wav|right now today's marketing monday is about the funniest ads of all time beginning
data/028918.wav|the fact that they wouldn't pick me up
data/027117.wav|this is about basically the amount of money that the
data/018876.wav|it's not a five-star ad this is not long-long
data/021645.wav|about electric vehicles and finding a way to get the
data/030485.wav|and then we can enjoy the food as it
data/016789.wav|the the the drop in global absolute poverty is massive
data/017720.wav|you couldn't tell they were new and that's why i think every new iphone from now on will have something done with the camera
data/008324.wav|if the had coming up yeah that's usually a bad sign
data/012515.wav|i hope you can make it cheaper
data/025685.wav|talk about it because i think that original study i talked about was flawed yes this ad is memorable i have not forgotten this ad sometimes i lie awake at night
data/020905.wav|grow at four percent you can invest and get
data/010176.wav|the twitch version of jackass i
data/022233.wav|that's what would happen for me so i was like wow
data/023101.wav|for ten dollars a pound relatively recently they rebranded
data/022974.wav|this is why i sort of side with epic in general is because they're not a company that has too much weight to throw around anymore not as much they're still powerful and
data/015784.wav|there's like there's a bunch of tiny niche streaming
data/027530.wav|well the founder and they got a new ceo who promised to make some changes and and
data/006149.wav|we been talking mad game about his
data/008538.wav|that he had to do it but the scale was
data/011670.wav|military prison here you can see it
data/002174.wav|all their social i found out their job history on linkedin i found out like what they were working on uh if they had
data/023207.wav|juice it's not the juice you bought if you buy
data/021499.wav|in a perfect world they would just wait they would just
data/002265.wav|and didn't even copy paste it
data/016088.wav|there's my case study on spoons what
data/028340.wav|this is sort of heat it up no this is turned from this is sort of heated up now this has turned from a friendly game
data/012075.wav|he really the actors were great i
data/007071.wav|i've never i've never it's never happened to
data/030195.wav|while the rope and i jumped up on his legs and i'm just
data/022792.wav|that was dumb but they also acquired
data/021454.wav|apple is the most valuable company on earth there's just more shares of apple look at berkshire hathaway
data/023150.wav|this is my social earlier where i said sun's out buns out and obviously like i
data/003613.wav|fucking the cost of rent and housing is so high that like
data/027419.wav|looking confused and wistful and forlorn which i thought was a great tweet and
data/004102.wav|it'll work i have something i gotta say
data/023310.wav|in the world but it's impressive to see because this could have been a bigger story for longer and it
data/030143.wav|in the world from the guys that made the witcher i have to have it pre-order do you guys remember that when i said i might not do anything but cyberpunk for two
data/006776.wav|what a miserable game what a miserable game that was
data/002204.wav|i never even heard of facebook all right
data/022142.wav|his tweet to eight million people thank god
data/020720.wav|outliers are about how difficult it can be to find sources of truth during a time of institutional trust you might be
data/014250.wav|but i don't blame them for good business they can do that if it works but in ludwig's case i think it was a mistake i think
data/023861.wav|that example this could theoretically be an exa an
data/027417.wav|the actual free version does not appear on google no matter what and so i give the
data/002105.wav|mike is hanging on for dear life it is it is
data/005530.wav|he did coding for like health insurance companies so i really
data/022120.wav|interviews with the super bowl story
data/002066.wav|but i'll get really into jesus
data/015499.wav|then they'll shoot up but right now they're valued exactly the same
data/010985.wav|actually right now my parents have it
data/014275.wav|new strategy of grabbing groups not just people
data/025191.wav|and then went all in on it it's crazy and they thought it was going to be super fucking clever and like and they went all in on it it's crazy and they thought it was gonna be super
data/025844.wav|switching directors switching talent swapping in and out trying to find the right fit they farted out a bad movie a poorly received movie 10 years later
data/005689.wav|best friends i don't know anything about him
data/005035.wav|would be like hey i had
data/004547.wav|i swear to you dude come on come on as
data/017631.wav|with the display it apple chose to
data/005000.wav|and have evidence that you knew about any bots um we're
data/011427.wav|you know yeah you can for sure we're always looking
data/029097.wav|up i will say it how old
data/000375.wav|i'm trying to get my team hyped
data/000302.wav|i didn't think i'd see them some of them not at the wedding even and
data/001803.wav|the the best remember but it's fine
data/029239.wav|the curtain i pull it so smoothly that he could just
data/006714.wav|the stream and then on twitter someone was asking
data/013149.wav|want anything it's wild mario movie exactly
data/001592.wav|no seriously though inflation's a real problem in this country
data/005355.wav|so i was like i couldn't handle it all right
data/019949.wav|it lags my computer this is to scale you're probably thinking that's enough on its own to be in the top ten but
data/031379.wav|listen when i think boat when i think it's six people all from
data/010086.wav|with was something anyway uh i'm gonna try i'm gonna try
data/019184.wav|it starts taking off oh my God oh my God
data/031910.wav|for all of us for like all the friend group to go to prom i shouldn't tell
data/028245.wav|but but they were actually like the most
data/027885.wav|a great example actually more recently because
data/013195.wav|as will be able to breathe i
data/021456.wav|at amazon by like a hundred thousand times
data/016670.wav|was the average norm across the entire country people used to always get eight and a half plus and now they're getting closer to six the average person
data/008652.wav|doing like his bot argument doesn't have legal
data/027551.wav|it's in the company um but
data/010701.wav|i didn't say that or when mr beast shows up doesn't every retail worker get one day
data/015246.wav|well finale and ending of gain of game of
data/024405.wav|they don't have good compelling deep characters i'm sick of games they don't have storylines that grab you and hook you that have dialogue
data/025868.wav|for eight hours of play test for no money they couldn't stream it they couldn't make a video they wanted to just sit down and play test it for eight hours a day and give
data/021042.wav|and i guess it's promising these lonely gamers that that
data/024946.wav|at seventy thousand dollars on fate grand
data/014285.wav|add the clout in the and the clout and the and the drama and
data/022134.wav|was managing the email as before i
data/019060.wav|you know about how i kind of
data/008685.wav|matt levine if you guys want
data/025194.wav|it's baffling it really is baffling for such an iconic
data/008929.wav|twitter the interest of its stockholders the transaction must agree to and the
data/012308.wav|with the table and so i did a lot of drinking and gambling at that table it was actually really fun it was actually really fun so i kind of
data/024066.wav|this is nine head by only fans and then like oh my god they completely don't get it porn is like so important to only fans how could they be so stupid oh one more thing my only fans launches next week and let me tell you it is
data/000946.wav|but i had i had like
data/023900.wav|he did it when he was like 13 years old
data/028185.wav|a shocking story and i would not
data/013980.wav|but the ceo of clarina talk and he seems
data/027332.wav|and players of their own game by getting mad
data/023176.wav|right now off camera because like the picture on the right is
data/026388.wav|if they didn't you couldn't tell they were new and that's why i think every new iphone from now on will have something done
data/016643.wav|very high cost locations where there's not much sunlight will still be cheaper to have uh solar
data/014913.wav|at the canadian hacker he must have made a good amount of money
data/030526.wav|why because her dad is harder to talk to
data/022145.wav|it really was just a terrible experience that being said this was my fault
data/006283.wav|guy named anonymous that was me i wanted to buy it so i could burn it
data/017096.wav|always a critic i guess i
data/018771.wav|they're gonna announce something about god of war
data/001313.wav|prehistoric building videos are fake it was a great video
data/006261.wav|any any chance he reacted to the
data/004736.wav|kate himself from the deal that he signed a few months ago how did we get here where
data/020526.wav|was probably means more crunch i feel bad
data/020373.wav|weird tension between the two this is given a one i
data/031122.wav|it's only because you have to look at other streamers on twitch it's it's like
data/017936.wav|it's money if you're like the lions or something you can just be
data/003717.wav|the think that it's possible to maybe start doing monopoly you know punishments and like
data/026116.wav|so i was actually really impressed with the
data/027220.wav|these and all that so this is an example of l
data/016604.wav|both men and women but especially among young men
data/008476.wav|soccer players in the world came out of brazil no
data/029183.wav|it didn't turn out to be that bad actually was kind of cool but i was a
data/003659.wav|it again it's my classic dr pepper mr
data/026772.wav|rather than opt out and that that has real it's with a lot of
data/003410.wav|pretty fierce debate between a lot of different sides over whether she should go or not because
data/017782.wav|the the doesn't have an impact on the sales he sells more subs than most people if you
data/027148.wav|the spigot they stop buying the bad debt
data/008972.wav|is the twitter once he agrees to sign them by
data/012849.wav|i kick it literally saved my life like if he hadn't if this event hadn't been
data/003752.wav|why people but after citizens united they can just
data/028163.wav|million dollars which is a big chunk of what the company makes that's a very very high salary for a
data/013054.wav|much better job with stricter qualifications
data/024739.wav|why business might be interested in this kind of model
data/004204.wav|is the vast majority of the time i've been streaming so thank you that's that's
data/012111.wav|so i'm getting frustrated with darth earl
data/029792.wav|what of yourself as a player who commented on the side like
data/022907.wav|private emails from the other side to use to prove their case and they're getting made public one of the big reveals of the apple versus epic
data/014744.wav|she just got me some stew okay
data/011124.wav|in the volume up and down uh you
data/008870.wav|because that's what they were promised
data/002246.wav|they do a lot of stunt stuff they do the thing to where they they sent the
data/025924.wav|is riot but i wanted to do a quick jab here at valve because i found this tweet
data/024342.wav|what your insurance company is called tell us what you do tell us how
data/018975.wav|better for zoomers and the problem was
data/004298.wav|that's literally and figuratively oh is
data/028157.wav|it goes through there is no shot it's worth a billion dollars even at their crazy outlandish numbers even if using their extreme expectations it's still
data/017039.wav|what's up i haven't watched in a while i
data/015125.wav|they noticed everyone likes to binge
data/007409.wav|go to a melee tournament and i know everybody i'd walk around i know i'm
data/027126.wav|the first year of it it's like everything's on crack and that's why we
data/002930.wav|you know watched the action sequences
data/026300.wav|experience a cleaner store a better stand a better display
data/001768.wav|that would have been much better as
data/014597.wav|would you consider heading an nvidia
data/031045.wav|black mold i pity the person that got that apartment after me because they paid three times the rent
data/013480.wav|i feel like you're late okay uh girlfriend is crying me i already
data/030119.wav|he's like mad that we bought this like it clearly seems
data/030244.wav|and my friend john who is a very
data/007364.wav|were hugging we were hugging like the end of world war ii by the way i was there similar
data/004075.wav|it's like oh thanks for the four months and you
data/000494.wav|the it's the but but in that moment all i needed was sweet relief so i
data/021265.wav|it also have more games out of the gate
data/004674.wav|will you remember streaming fondly when you're sure you're certain
data/021289.wav|the counter side one of the best things youtube have that
data/027116.wav|i was rapidly worthless so let's take a
data/027763.wav|the fans of his stock picking show his
data/030996.wav|with sf was so cause like right in
data/000684.wav|we get there and they take us to this little room it's very well decorated it's got like cool prints in the
data/005311.wav|so why did the whole full
data/000707.wav|it'll be a follower and he's like let's go to
data/019690.wav|for your phone number i know it seemed weird
data/025143.wav|like little gif project and they paid a
data/027780.wav|the everything bubble is popping so
data/027124.wav|and it worked and unfortunate thing about that working is that we haven't stopped that strategy since and you know this happened slowly
data/003233.wav|grindy pokemon game for the fun of it and and still spend money though still
data/020335.wav|to be a fobner success wasn't just
data/009747.wav|that will be stupid enough because like there's no
data/021090.wav|if you're worried that i'm being biased right now just know that if you love this ad i am
data/007290.wav|you know given the age gap but i did flick off a child because i'll explain
data/013744.wav|tesla to make a statue of elon musk and it looks it looks nothing like
data/012186.wav|you know it's one of the blue shirts that have the
data/012196.wav|very cool thing and come down to the basement so you can lose
data/024532.wav|are they brought an apple executive onto
data/015158.wav|at to deliver squid getting people
data/020295.wav|and i think making this a little
data/010446.wav|what happening but for real same though i appreciate that good energy i've been
data/016655.wav|in the history of companies it's bigger than stripe facebook
data/002771.wav|oh yeah one more time big reminder
data/030442.wav|this is the this is where it is
data/029573.wav|it kind of chilling at the time to think that there could be more than one
data/031425.wav|with this and we got competitive with bocce
data/010065.wav|the rules are simple and they are threefold number one the video cannot be too long number two the video cannot be
data/030640.wav|is there like the largest river in russia is lake
data/022272.wav|the minimum so you bought about 40 seconds
data/004759.wav|he was not exhibiting the telltale signs of a person about to go through with a deal in fact he was doing the opposite he was
data/022775.wav|too much king radio on the internet that is genius number two now i think you
data/022973.wav|even come close turning a profit it's
data/026071.wav|in january and the sequel by march and if we put enough money into this we can make it happen
data/015146.wav|what you billion dollars of debt to just buy content now they don't make
data/026710.wav|of activision blizzard can get a nice paycheck exit because again this is where the stock was and instead the purchase price that microsoft's buying
data/028953.wav|skateboarding around you know and it was fun it was just really fun
data/001214.wav|i don't let me give a random example let's say there was a instagram dog food company right and you are very passionate about dogs and you
data/020862.wav|is not the next tech hub
data/014583.wav|go plus launch if they cared about losing face they
data/016973.wav|were you guys you know what i'm gonna
data/009513.wav|what's your tournament this is i mean i'm not saying it's it's functionally impossible i'm just saying i rarely see it this is this looks like a sweep is
data/011577.wav|are right here this is the real
data/017357.wav|and unfolds over the next decades the pipeline is there and ready
data/010438.wav|dipping fountain you know where it's like a bunch of cheese uh it'll be great it'll be great i'm
data/013888.wav|i think it was that great i thought it
data/020858.wav|the twitch who did not have college degrees and they made it to work at twitch and
data/000940.wav|you are aware of the glizzy hands meme
data/022948.wav|as dominant okay let's make this a huge win for us all epic is not changing its mind on the issue so let's just agree on it now that is the most cold final line i've ever seen in
data/028583.wav|boys what else what else can i answer for you oh a league story
data/024906.wav|wong psychological hook just doing some kind of effort and then getting a randomized reward and if you combine those two
data/007498.wav|and she's like oh i'm you got the original
data/025861.wav|how important influencers are and paying them appropriately early in this video he talks about how riot games made a bounty board to play league of legends on stream and they didn't care if you were
data/000158.wav|so first off it's four of us okay and we start out and we hit vegas and we're just
data/022835.wav|because i didn't want to take it up
data/006975.wav|by the way i'm not trying to whatever i don't even know i
data/029600.wav|which is like the the one solo god the true end of the
data/010153.wav|right yeah i know because i
data/002165.wav|if you tomorrow should i belittle my interviewer to show dominance oh yeah oh oh i'm glad you asked yes dear god you were
data/011774.wav|i don't believe you're from now huda
data/013180.wav|there is literally no way that dozens of you from antarctica that obviously which
data/016919.wav|new these nuts thank you thank you thank you i do appreciate it
data/003383.wav|to continue to compete even after his little finger was put in a cast joining us now is assistant professor from the university of michigan and core faculty at their robotics
data/018254.wav|oh my god i give it a point for just
data/013675.wav|they were first but i think if you were to
data/026803.wav|work elsewhere they have to pay them a lot of money to work there because their brand is bad so they're they're losing like innovative founders that want to build with the company
data/028304.wav|that the question and eventually like
data/003242.wav|the sharp-eyed people who read books guess what there is a new opportunity for you because i think
data/025604.wav|in google and they were called fang but
data/010152.wav|the patriot poster sold for 800.
data/011701.wav|wait like the whole thing is like it's not
data/028067.wav|one between the two of you now can go
data/019010.wav|like immediately like when i first
data/012257.wav|i because the most fun thing for me was
data/028438.wav|school and take me home but my dad my
data/032291.wav|the guys if at all today you hear that my
data/000723.wav|ways forever and i've always like i've looked up to
data/012192.wav|like doing something you were like she was
data/010459.wav|one day did you spam roll my monkey ball roll
data/013056.wav|not fair and then i feel bad for students
data/020799.wav|while they did it pretty well there's funnier ads there's more emotional ads but i think that one felt truly nike while still being a powerful ad only barely edged out friends
data/025795.wav|if the fans but it's still phenomenally reviewed the critic scores
data/031269.wav|as this moment is happening right about here i pop off loudly i
data/015681.wav|wanted they're trying to get bigger everyone's
data/026474.wav|what about amd drivers right now let me tell you i am not happy about them that is the
data/024872.wav|in a previous marketing monday actually we're
data/003001.wav|it down the hallway the side hallways
data/000264.wav|just how insane of a baller ludwig is now and i do i really appreciate it
data/009341.wav|is actually one of the best hosts
data/008416.wav|it's like it's like ai generated off the
data/010466.wav|but uh turns out i've made a shift
data/022640.wav|they took the less angry take if you're going to act you
data/010747.wav|i grabbed the dog i'd grab some stuff i'd
data/031984.wav|with our first guest ludwig ludwig
data/017501.wav|going forward you know what turns out he was right and when you screenshot
data/027676.wav|his plan by his logic i would have to pay 75
data/008871.wav|i for that amount of money and all the shareholders
data/005049.wav|if the the company marked safe from pregnancy today
data/015623.wav|well shows but they're not they're not growing okay and they don't have any new
data/000740.wav|and he's my best man and i'm
data/014589.wav|well let's say nobody did they can still every year say that youtube gaming is
data/019961.wav|ten years it was all like simba from the lion king
data/032091.wav|it's or whatever with a story
data/019522.wav|it is a catchy jingle and this still goes i might have to just
data/004813.wav|a lot more has been happening to mr
data/018733.wav|so this let's go into this on the marketing side this is the flex factor case study okay year over year over year iphone sales were doing great they were crushing iphone was the
data/020547.wav|to where they could have been so they have to do two big
data/015405.wav|at idea so the next few years are
data/003054.wav|well i did it was netflix crackdown on password
data/022858.wav|what you're doing is corrupt he said right here i found this line they said
data/016567.wav|lots and lots of education based startups are being funded right now because the gap between what people need to get and the cost of it has never been higher so
data/030852.wav|that's one thing so let me let me just role
data/023119.wav|is the indian name for corn and call it maize syrup
data/012427.wav|we just need an official dealer to give us each
data/028029.wav|ratified their union contracts and they are now having a target union it's awesome
data/011814.wav|what mickey mouse has a gun to their family's
data/004576.wav|the little cap that goes onto
data/003596.wav|but software is still a great career path like if

data/029456.wav|i'm on my phone a little bit then like 10 minutes go by so i'm like
data/019054.wav|is like a delicious combo meal
data/014298.wav|gone past the sticks and stones era it's gone past the guns era and we are now in the nuclear bomb era this is the nuclear bombs of the streaming wars and i want to show you this
data/010880.wav|are morons but after like wins or before
data/003936.wav|i'll be voting for the amazon party jeff bezos baby big jeff i'm voting for the joker what if we all just write in the
data/004733.wav|it's melting down and going through what i would consider one of the biggest midlife crisis
data/021166.wav|boys are you ready i hope you're ready for marketing monday
data/024902.wav|that yourself the way games use it is they will do
data/020597.wav|they're having a very heated conversation i don't know what about probably marketing wait i'm
data/010044.wav|but i'm here today because the state of the world is so awful and i can't sit back and just be an actor anymore not with this incredible platform the
data/025729.wav|than trying to go big on a platform let's watch the other ones see if they're any
data/017180.wav|we also super glad that i'm well i'll be dead honest with you i didn't mention this in the funny copic stories video
data/001206.wav|getting as a team if you're a teen
data/024382.wav|we both at the height of their fame in 2004
data/027236.wav|come from developers it reads like sour grapes it reads like not understanding that there may be something distinct here that is refreshing to gamers that
data/007713.wav|in mexico with ari's extended family
data/015682.wav|alex and disney basically and my prediction i want to
data/004057.wav|okay that's your money that's harder
data/010755.wav|him on the other that's wild
data/029436.wav|look a little office chair to the side of his desk like a dwight and he's talking to me he's like yo
data/001116.wav|is responsible for that i am
data/017917.wav|if you like any marvel movie god forbid
data/026389.wav|in new way of configuring the camera or
data/031656.wav|and i've got my hand on it and we're
data/007176.wav|it it's doing things that no
data/008856.wav|and he's got kids on kids what if they make him buy it at a lesser
data/003629.wav|sounds like it's just incredibly expensive for that reason
data/017121.wav|state your name i don't i
data/000985.wav|am i doing what's going on you got
data/019229.wav|the Wii did so many things to say this
data/015379.wav|the wire and and sopranos and all that and ha and they've really punched above
data/019973.wav|is this is a conservative estimate because really without it disney
data/006490.wav|people actually put a lot of money into savings all that money is now gone savings are dried up people have
data/015100.wav|if the the company dvds are dying weak
data/023250.wav|but it's basically about how our
data/003311.wav|hard numbers to estimate that so there's no way we could be in a
data/001250.wav|one person which is this woman right here and maybe she's good at
data/007704.wav|you should divorce your girl to pursue your career
data/004744.wav|a share let's check twitter stock real quick let's just do a quick check now full disclosure i mentioned
data/007124.wav|asking especially in places like that with like recycled air and
data/004123.wav|extend that's a big company and so you don't need to pester them if they happen
data/028964.wav|i've got nothing i literally have no money and no one really to go to like for for for like a week like there's
data/004073.wav|thanks for the nine months whatever that's a
data/001661.wav|i just thought cats were lame until
data/022129.wav|we're all aware that you're an employee this is all a scheme to make money
data/002304.wav|or bit you think it's worth it
data/005126.wav|i stalked him i asked for an autograph i followed him to his car it's it's it
data/018344.wav|is actually a pretty good topic for for
data/014750.wav|the one hundred drafts of this song and i don't remember
data/019838.wav|like the game world is so epically big
data/027412.wav|intuit realized that would cost them a lot of money so they drastically ramped up their lobbying spending and started paying politicians and paying lobbyists to slow this down or stop it and eventually the compromise they agreed to
data/021826.wav|the the things about jeff bezos and his colossal
data/030767.wav|that's so sweet but why do you think i'd
data/023978.wav|well on my channel they launched only fans
data/008192.wav|i just thought i'd promote hellofresh
data/009717.wav|at haircut and a nail removal i need to get
data/006560.wav|yeah that's the part where they get you
data/000053.wav|if that i would skip it because my bachelor party yes on sunday when all the boys were out partying i said no i said boys you go enjoy yourself there's learning to be done and i sat my white ass down
data/006989.wav|i understand that it was a fantastic event
data/005202.wav|i own i don't think i i don't think
data/019188.wav|word that the average person would say Nintendo was just video games
data/005539.wav|and the more drunk they got the more i
data/019536.wav|america now hear the full might of the canadian marketing military
data/020217.wav|the website was shut down and not much remains except for these and also this text document
data/017872.wav|but they're not it's not their focus anymore
data/013597.wav|stealing his prime set in house
data/030189.wav|that's the important thing if somebody doesn't want you to
data/019320.wav|this is a little more of a
data/031125.wav|nowadays it's getting different but when
data/024645.wav|in construction and stuff that no
data/029586.wav|we talked about how well you talked
data/011496.wav|it wasn't really a joker movie you understand it was like it was very obviously they pasted on the fact that
data/025942.wav|is this is the first of its kind they
data/018841.wav|what a journey please write the ad boys I want
data/003899.wav|with an aggressive yeah i mean the santa's
data/007871.wav|well actually interesting that you say that you might have accurately predicted an upcoming marketing monday are you married yet
data/018988.wav|in quicker and faster and cheaper uh
data/000036.wav|jesus christ speak english i'm canadian i never heard that yeah i
data/018572.wav|now neither side are flopping out of the
data/031449.wav|like got cuts he's got cuts on his legs he was getting
data/010210.wav|i just asked my friend to do it so i could stream it on the internet
data/016994.wav|when he's got a really fun story about kung fu panda that i that i enjoyed and i'm going to
data/012572.wav|okay yeah so i finally signed into that
data/004835.wav|well yeah there's gotta be more coming right
data/010172.wav|i think unless you really felt pain with pepper spray in your eyes like you
data/019978.wav|if the the the success that is frozen super
data/010085.wav|so we have either the cheesy bacon ranch shredded chicken we have the shredded chicken taco bowl or we have i don't know what this is
data/001070.wav|my editors to the bachelor party okay but not quack though
data/008979.wav|with any sort of bearing on the contract it holds a drop of water rather than the
data/001196.wav|cup ramen they're simple affordable one
data/019360.wav|jason he's like dude we're fine our grade is set
data/002894.wav|if the the situation so i i i
data/010623.wav|at mario and i know that like you know i know he's i know that he's a good
data/024648.wav|the quarters all be green i'll be positive they said we're doing great we're doing
data/009451.wav|it is a thing of beauty and it looked like just judging from the
data/012547.wav|a more bustling thing for people
data/022400.wav|by being consistent over many years they get way more value than trying to to farm one ad for a little extra
data/020156.wav|if childhoods by remakes sequels spin-offs
data/013168.wav|it's where i watch something with chat but i am sort of with my energy and aura responding to it okay i don't react reacting is cringe i respond okay and i want you guys to
data/002469.wav|if they weren't like you know what i'm saying it
data/016720.wav|meeting hours per workday during the pandemic uh
data/002027.wav|interesting i don't i can't say that i love that perspective
data/011997.wav|at the help out rey and the resistance
data/011652.wav|about this i thought about how the fact that i
data/013878.wav|it's not that fun to get into if you loved arcane but you can play
data/011443.wav|the willingness to reach beyond your current limit stretch
data/013169.wav|and it is powerful and it is what makes me a better person than reactors hi
data/000178.wav|like they didn't tell me anything ahead of time so the only thing i knew going in is when i got leaked when i was at
data/011976.wav|bad guy missions and ari who would never do anything like that is getting all of like the good guy
data/012560.wav|well i saw almost all my
data/010199.wav|know this about getting pepper sprayed i
data/032324.wav|but it's not the whole community obviously there is just some percentage of people in the
data/026860.wav|as celebrity endorsements goes first of all they picked the best one right now
data/027242.wav|and i think there are i think that there are are
data/003060.wav|we were running out so we the
data/015831.wav|that that is the that is the change of
data/027050.wav|i don't think this did what they wanted which
data/000956.wav|are reborn on monday and then they just all die over the week and so saturday is our only chance to rejuvenate but if you do it on thursday you still have some of your brain cells left to actually
data/009000.wav|they put out the lawsuit it's it's available to read if you want to check it out i mean it's
data/025877.wav|we don't have any plans at moment to do uh
data/012589.wav|get to where they were netflix uh dizzies
data/001692.wav|vindictive selfish cruel a slacker and
data/030578.wav|calling you fat in your engagement
data/005077.wav|bridge on that now thankfully though thankfully though because
data/011777.wav|two problems here not only am i not in the larping but i'm also i know too much about star wars
data/016114.wav|well i could do oh we could watch that
data/009752.wav|takes it out has it put onto his face
data/022016.wav|second best time is now and burger king responded by saying
data/031841.wav|i know they have like their own versions of the archetypes like they have like a spanish language lud and they have a spanish language
data/017428.wav|what a big fail and make fun of you because that's a good way to
data/018794.wav|as universally put this as a three what a curve what a
data/027128.wav|and so we're starting to get uh
data/017394.wav|i played league of legends and there was a funny clip out of it where emiru didn't remember doing a game
data/004404.wav|and thank you for reaching out
data/015139.wav|for what you're making and what he said quite prophetically is that content is basically everyone
data/001172.wav|enough sprig so i've tried them all and the
data/000276.wav|and so the casino had offered to comp him a room if he was
data/032207.wav|yet but we're all up like two three four grand if we just take this money and double up tonight and
data/013938.wav|variety names because they don't want to say interest they never want to say interest and
data/016943.wav|you can look it up i looked
data/011641.wav|because she loves animals and gators and
data/022115.wav|the end of a super bowl live tweet but the way they responded did not lean into that
data/003587.wav|the for there's just no there's no upside in the moment
data/012231.wav|and then he flips over and i flip over
data/005558.wav|in her friends and i drove but apparently there was a shuttle that was sent there like a shuttle
data/027513.wav|he basically worked like four hours a
data/022532.wav|as ad for google it just talks about how
data/007689.wav|they record in the morning oh yeah i usually do every day i stream during the best
data/022514.wav|you know it's like all right but the end of the day does it look gross cause then we have another piece you know it's like all right but at the end of the day does it look gross
data/029044.wav|the spree him the parking lot the area the angle i
data/007963.wav|i'm giving him a percentage cut of the revenue of every marketing monday video
data/016232.wav|you autozone jingle and now king
data/004780.wav|i immediately got cold feet and at this moment as this all started happening it became very clear that he didn't really want
data/022221.wav|in your mind sad it was a ghost i don't like it especially for
data/000301.wav|i have guys showed up and
data/028332.wav|ben sw wins okay now i think it's
data/007881.wav|as you said pipe above door in front of elevator you already looked at it i assume i missed some kind of pipe
data/000603.wav|the whole thing ruled i'll be honest with every single one of us loved that
data/029877.wav|was you weren't there was like a canadian tournament and i was talking to mango like after the tournament or whatever and i dunno how you came up like i was talking about i was prior with it twice was you weren't there it was like a canadian tournament and i was talking to mango like after the tournament or whatever
data/006547.wav|in the a major way and i think it's uh
data/003453.wav|you know it's very strategically important semiconductor
data/031078.wav|it's funnier than because i had worked at twitch right and
data/015607.wav|i wanted to say one thing i'm sorry
data/015136.wav|better club for golfers okay your total addressable market is all
data/025388.wav|are you talking about that's not
data/015521.wav|cost as much to make as the final season of game of thrones so
data/023483.wav|in one thousand dollars okay ford is targeting essentially the
data/029103.wav|i was really trying to make a track twitch
data/010919.wav|so it's more of a process where like you
data/005850.wav|what the whole time both of us know that he's seen it
data/002168.wav|why their hobbies why their hobbies their interests their weaknesses their fears
data/016799.wav|is that target these new global uh
data/015644.wav|gotten so far that's not big enough to win a
data/007499.wav|well joe right and he's like well i got all
data/021452.wav|that is completely wrong and i'm not trying to make fun of you but
data/001752.wav|job of like painting this guy's mental
data/024530.wav|allow me to read the codes anyway i'm gonna tell
data/013479.wav|so maybe get on your grind even earlier maybe this is kind of old in fact if you're if you're only rich by the time you're this age i feel like you're late
data/005863.wav|i want to get time i had a good time i had good conversations
data/015468.wav|i can't do that because they would lose too much money from the way things are and so while other companies that are struggling can be more nimble like
data/007322.wav|or seven to one maybe it was just three to one either way i got bad odds it was odds against me and they were like
data/021809.wav|welcome to marketing monday jeff bezos edition also titled
data/016376.wav|this money went to fraud but what i want to talk about is the larger problem
data/010098.wav|one canada i think it might even be us only but worth checking go to
data/006434.wav|of sorrow he has a 5
data/023403.wav|i think there was a funny quote where the guy's
data/000687.wav|but we're this little room and we think
data/012963.wav|but just know that it's expensive and
data/017174.wav|things that are not happening today but i do need to work on and eventually deliver and that is a
data/002458.wav|cause then you get too specific and you cut yourself out of a lot of other people who also like your product
data/014491.wav|that i'm calling the bagel metaphor the world of
data/028623.wav|okay now uh it was quite a busy time at twitch i
data/026418.wav|effective so and and you can apply
data/023810.wav|a russian spy or something yeah
data/002061.wav|well this is what this is what
data/030199.wav|of the night we were both like like out of breath gamers um but he said afterwards
data/023916.wav|and i never understood when my dad
data/021450.wav|the or even like let's say
data/031655.wav|definitely feels awkward though right because he's got his
data/025814.wav|is on top of the world today let's start by talking about arcane again okay
data/003689.wav|that moment you start to see changes
data/029915.wav|at regionals and we were stopped at a gas station
data/014650.wav|one of my favorites in a while should be a good one
data/015810.wav|of dying and they're having trouble growing but
data/031822.wav|which is the goal i've been trying to get into so the
data/000399.wav|everyone's winning i think i'm winning
data/007760.wav|i was getting ready for stream i took a
data/016357.wav|be loans that were given out at the start of
data/023640.wav|into the mainstream so there is a benefit but as an
data/019061.wav|yeah but maybe like a burger will cheer me up well like
data/029164.wav|is gonna die and i only have about
data/030902.wav|i think we played when we were at your house
data/004844.wav|he got into like a ton of this seems minor now but it was really funny he
data/010146.wav|wearing chevy oh nice little drink though
data/030099.wav|the gimmick of this game in
data/010783.wav|there are two balloons inside of
data/022803.wav|america online is making it easier called america online play
data/003529.wav|yes just for obvious reasons money you don't have like if you needed a car loan to get a car to go to a
data/022913.wav|it right the leak basically proves
data/010263.wav|well of allow him to compete because he's not a
data/025586.wav|beat saver has a passionate community i
data/013072.wav|please but he left because the other priests
data/025828.wav|what do you guys think this graph is this is a graph of
data/010682.wav|and there's not going to be one because that would be
data/032401.wav|in the dark but i didn't do it it's really weird not this he was
data/004162.wav|i'm actually i'm actually crying you made me
data/011350.wav|it was such a that was such a that was such a
data/032414.wav|it should be considered like an all-time great
data/019442.wav|wheat is the best food of man
data/002958.wav|of what they're doing but we'll see
data/006548.wav|it's a win for about five minutes when they
data/018351.wav|i'm not giving you stock in hrock for
data/012728.wav|not it's not even a fun game there's not even a
data/029857.wav|gotta watch this and it was just like juggle fox getting destroyed
data/024119.wav|well america hooked on the mobility adventure of hyundai the unfortunate part is it hasn't really taken off to a great
data/009674.wav|i'm not going to play valo no i'm not
data/015224.wav|great movie you kind of want
data/018929.wav|we've been really watch tv and they pressed her and said you must watch something you must watch something if you're going to be doing this
data/003150.wav|i know who are going through some really tough times they're reporting earnings soon
data/004852.wav|it the only place i saw my name cropped off anywhere on the internet
data/016314.wav|literally to the bone and you just have to give
data/001705.wav|i never talked about the problem of the lazy poor i've only talked about grandpa
data/032026.wav|to keep it short sweet and leave
data/009627.wav|the melee series and then played the next 10
data/004197.wav|can can mine be like do you accept chatters as db friends what is db these balls damn get

data/018154.wav|dude this is so poorly designed i can't even imagine i can't even imagine
data/012769.wav|i don't think lorenzo is one
data/006852.wav|and then i push it off the curb and then i get back on yeah yeah yeah wicked
data/013533.wav|but he wasn't half bad he
data/020017.wav|the number six acquisition is elon musk acquiring these hair plugs and a good night's sleep that has made him the second richest

data/014386.wav|dirt culture and chat and this includes
data/023267.wav|and i was like i was i was getting mad at her i was like babe i'm sorry to break it to
data/017877.wav|they have massive monopolies they they can charge whatever they want they don't advertise to get you excited about the product

data/024794.wav|a false heuristic in your brain that the odds of it are higher than they actually are you are more likely to think it's possible when you see other people getting it let me give you a direct quote here this is a direct quote again from a game developer that makes mobile games do not tell your players that the majority of people do not spend money that is
data/027168.wav|i think i'm saying today is all to say
data/011628.wav|in the dating and as of now i mean she's like in a
data/023887.wav|in the mango we're gonna watch
data/024170.wav|if the platform deals are hard to say no to because especially if you're not like incredibly still hungry to grow they provide you like the stability of being like i'm good with twitch you could

data/003346.wav|will been taking on debt to pay for their regular expenses so even though we haven't seen a slowdown in spending as much as you'd expect we have seen a rise in credit card debt

data/024155.wav|and claims to have made three thousand dollars it's just it's a it's a difference it's a difference in
data/004958.wav|the deal he is hoping to get completely out of the deal have tesla
data/027449.wav|india of a beat that i just made you can just tell she's
data/015549.wav|that's it when you're a super rich mega

data/009358.wav|i mean you know what i'm saying
data/005693.wav|with the first came out and finding out they're
data/019703.wav|in that conversation is that number one the autozone ceo responded to him that's cool you know maybe they're not going to use it there's probably some rights issues actually from using an employee's song
data/025494.wav|what the stock upstart holdings and now he's talking about how great it is on
data/004405.wav|wait till he drops the pps pps you do

data/028470.wav|what were you doing last night i got all
data/006768.wav|it's not a joke this is not a joke this is not a
data/026338.wav|i can create a story that is not a typical tech ceo outlook especially back in
data/009519.wav|in the same while they're doing it they're
data/028651.wav|weird like there's nothing to camp out for there's no line there's no big release
data/020880.wav|oh damn okay starting a business is not right for everybody
data/017762.wav|go sells more subs than anyone his size
data/018758.wav|in a superficially change something about this camera so you know it's the new one why
data/031129.wav|or like shroud would like not care about content or tweets or
data/002810.wav|elon musk and it's sad because his friendship with google's ceo sergey brin for some reason
data/016268.wav|when his research but i got no regrets
data/027972.wav|for the player base significantly that means this guy has skin artists
data/020757.wav|and i like to think it took exactly 11 months because they started
data/031036.wav|we looked into the walls because we were trying to get our deposit back by the way vlad took my entire deposit wholesale
data/003976.wav|the vote bald no matter who
data/020180.wav|be smiling that was my one my one concern was why they had to be smiling but
data/013844.wav|this is all all all bad bad bad bad
data/006444.wav|and this was all a good thing when i was
data/010308.wav|at the point is that they're splitting it up
data/021613.wav|the cost over the past 10 years
data/024120.wav|at the pump those numbers up the comments are that came out of nowhere really random to have happened but okay and that's it
data/022982.wav|internal emails from apple by the way what
data/024156.wav|he made a lot more than that but he still
data/015249.wav|around here and what you'll see it's almost every streaming service outside of netflix has these big churn spikes once their talk show ends they might around here and what you'll see is almost every streaming service outside of netflix has
data/030422.wav|i would have got a better one anywhere else she was literally like i'm gonna tell you this is honest she's like an older gal
data/010523.wav|pretty cooking up cooking it up getting that
data/028367.wav|what the goal in this meeting
data/020104.wav|steve jobs is going to be the interim ceo but we're definitely getting a different ceo so don't worry he's just
data/027985.wav|give a win here you know how
data/016422.wav|the regular person or the money
data/027011.wav|guys blend right in the world needs you back
data/006651.wav|i don't have time to do it so i'm squeezing into wins and fails

data/023987.wav|in the porn industry investing in a million different porn sites okay he's not like a prude this guy's not like oh we have to get the adult content

data/028219.wav|you know he's just like oh you're
data/030430.wav|we are not actors okay so like we didn't know
data/008520.wav|money for not waiting the point is i wanted to leave with a profit because i acquired all my twitter
data/006386.wav|when they put out this commercial
data/013743.wav|somebody this week melted down a
data/016886.wav|will watch more twitch they didn't do anything better
data/013904.wav|i want to poor shame stands but his tv is
data/018724.wav|at the conference and i think they're going to be talking majority about this i'm
data/007729.wav|my weekend was awesome i got blackout drunk saturday and sunday night
data/016776.wav|do you think we have a lot of boomers now wait till
data/021943.wav|i'm gonna talk about some bad things
data/001489.wav|well let me think here what is something that
data/013792.wav|where do they come from i've never met a
data/030425.wav|the photographer was like seemed like an ex-spy like
data/022277.wav|i don't this one says the irish road safety ad is so
data/008393.wav|and i just kept noticing they put in actual
data/024028.wav|the fitness stuff and the cooking
data/027457.wav|as the world's biggest dream fan i have been able to follow all the drama
data/003956.wav|in tyler one's the brawn dude
data/019911.wav|and quake and his software he became
data/020161.wav|they go to frozen meat companies on twitter
data/014664.wav|yeah i'm eating kale chips that ari made
data/009888.wav|it's already knew this well before the rest of us and billionaires have been
data/021889.wav|if this guy can't win capitalism what
data/026004.wav|that's everyone's right in this country to do that if
data/026076.wav|i played league of legends and there was a funny clip out of it
data/028237.wav|as smart and he's a good
data/021934.wav|if i yoink a jet a joke from chat this
data/004506.wav|i just want to tell you one thing and that is happy
data/027527.wav|five million dollars a year on r d
data/015659.wav|these guys if they're if their strategy
data/000621.wav|we showed up it was so cool that nick
data/000821.wav|now that we spent was worth it was worth it
data/016186.wav|it take too long but i think it's
data/027134.wav|it's borrow from this and then loan the money out to you basically interest rates are the cost of borrowing money that's it and the government can set it by how much
data/018411.wav|warning warning warning warning warning put up your cringe shields
data/010795.wav|i think we do want it and what's great is even if i don't go to see it which i have yet to do for morbius i will get to see
data/004382.wav|cut the beginning there's no point for us to
data/021858.wav|is running the company flat flat flat barely anything flat a truck h truck joins amazon
data/027934.wav|if a job can at least know that he shares in their pain and is also down financially after spending
data/006899.wav|for twitch i lived at work how many times was i
data/017437.wav|i focused on results and what i'm gonna
data/010504.wav|i've seen it like multiple times
data/029194.wav|yeah it was just such a cool time to be at twitch because like this was the
data/014323.wav|okay do you guys remember when netflix used to be like
data/009282.wav|what do you think is a good way to escape the here we'll do
data/003608.wav|in the parents i gotta understand yeah totally
data/020220.wav|it's the terrible ted cruz is the zodiac killer
data/019340.wav|quote which i don't know why i
data/027308.wav|the down you know what i'm saying it would
data/014465.wav|as deals that's his story to tell everyone
data/032317.wav|data 11 hours worth of attempts i
data/011902.wav|who did a full like twilike she had the the
data/031236.wav|and i had a favorite player i've mentioned him on stream
data/029570.wav|east coast style west coast all this stuff
data/017655.wav|second thing on the purchase part of the clock is packaging packaging so apple has been an
data/017454.wav|but i have one more big win and that is of course all of the men and women who have been striking against corporate america and otherwise over the past few weeks specifically i want to call out this person this nominee for person of the year this is a lone striker holding down the picket line for the
data/023471.wav|the that is purely from the brand it costs
data/012516.wav|and what i think is because it's so new they probably made it expensive for this
data/014455.wav|courage in them are just as
data/019822.wav|in space stations roaming freighters crash
data/030371.wav|so my biggest fear was that i would leak the ring
data/020590.wav|it's so hard to get that back a brand that good is worth it's worth so much
data/018027.wav|extreme stream that is my goal that is my mission now
data/022926.wav|it doesn't make money for us you know what makes us money is getting a ton of kids to play it on
data/021505.wav|the hedge funds so let me explain what a hedge fund is because i think a lot of
data/025946.wav|at the way franchises in that league of legends tournament you saw about a million
data/006933.wav|or like dress a little nicer so i never
data/025501.wav|sorry you're breaking up it's not he
data/029457.wav|like all right i'll try cube world
data/014672.wav|one thing i will say is we're not doing
data/004527.wav|point of my stream is about
data/023195.wav|but they don't put this on the packaging they put this image
data/010898.wav|there we go right here the minions rise of
data/020736.wav|to qualify the ad must have released during this calendar year and again let me say this was a year of a global pandemic where almost every
data/015657.wav|i think the biggest upside i looked at all the data
data/010812.wav|the night repeat family friend i've only
data/028441.wav|my his office wasn't far from the school and he's like
data/003550.wav|it's just like it's like i guess a way to cope but
data/029172.wav|if things were not close to that this is twitch the size of twitch in
data/019904.wav|a time to don't do don't have the don't don't don't do don doted on the don't do don't do that the what is the most overhapped game of all
data/029722.wav|it before other people yeah he was like wait a minute i've been a competitor
data/026459.wav|almost business you interact with if you were to start a business you should think about how your customer interacts with you at all stages of the process in general
data/002328.wav|watch watching we're going to do
data/017062.wav|there was a new twitch atlas that released as
data/002100.wav|as the worst of the game like mpg arena
data/025598.wav|you need to smile more hey this is
data/022465.wav|which is dope as hell it's simple it's
data/017067.wav|this week because they've been piling up
data/030142.wav|i read an article about cyberpunk
data/030056.wav|if you don't have passage one on the screen so i
data/015867.wav|what platform and a lot of differences
data/018490.wav|why do i have one large
data/025243.wav|the amount of viewership on twitch would
data/016162.wav|half this website runs on yeti
data/030987.wav|in left i was like no i'm not leaving i'll pay the full amount
data/008891.wav|i have right now to vastly overpay for another company
data/014026.wav|have so many times i was
data/025302.wav|that's mango if there's anybody who's
data/016843.wav|what the actual impact will be but the depth and number of parameters in these ai models has increased exponentially
data/005046.wav|exactly anyway i don't have uh i
data/024845.wav|the killers want to win and they will spend anything to beat other people they are the most likely to fall for
data/012148.wav|it's override they're like yeah we're gonna
data/020169.wav|or something and just said you're
data/020823.wav|wow this is an honor and
data/007905.wav|and your messages are many you have
data/021563.wav|dawn tomorrow i think if you bought tomorrow and it spikes like all day and ends up higher you could hold a few more day i mean you
data/024652.wav|the data that i'm finding says no just as just just today two more gigantic real
data/019394.wav|crush competitors in the most efficient way so it
data/014561.wav|if the a lot of pausing on youtube is huge i
data/027725.wav|let's give a win to everyone in the
data/000931.wav|the deals done i'm making big deals today okay how else do i want to how
data/030353.wav|if i'm spending this much time with
data/015242.wav|the massive spike in churn what happened in
data/026309.wav|fifth avenue in new york you're
data/019313.wav|by your performance relative to others in this class which means like if you are last place you almost can't pass which means the stakes are
data/000288.wav|with the goddamn piano and a pool table
data/001259.wav|wife so i'll definitely check it out but i
data/028239.wav|in the other interview that has been such a difference i was hiring somebody for a social media role in marketing i know who's good at this kind of job and i knew what to look for
data/008032.wav|at all that it's going to
data/003527.wav|are no but i i would say that loans in general
data/030200.wav|that while he was doing that he pissed himself he said the exertion made him
data/012434.wav|well i'm playing with him i was already getting there within two days i grinded sabacc more than anyone else
data/010090.wav|mix them all together and most importantly they'll
data/006578.wav|for pennies they got the last
data/017928.wav|thinking of the business model that has
data/007199.wav|i found out from someone else that he was too shy he was too shy so i i think it was
data/027328.wav|example i i thought of this fashion brands will literally destroy billions of their own merchandise to keep it scarce they don't sell it for cheaper they don't discount it they destroy it because if it were to be sold for clearance or for cheap over time that would make it less scarce and reduce the brand value of their product it's basically what
data/007503.wav|of disgusting food and he like grabs his
data/024249.wav|walk away thinking yeah microsoft's really
data/004694.wav|and i'm excited to watch the boys tonight at 10
data/006544.wav|his pockets and they're just trying to offer financial service products and you know
data/027382.wav|it's content is just stolen copyrighted content but now roblox has gotten so big
data/000412.wav|if the closest thing to a coin flip in
data/030928.wav|one while as nerf and one wall is nerfed and one wall is uh
data/004332.wav|did it better he didn't get the cr
data/002267.wav|the cat walked across the pc and hit all their correct keys
data/020661.wav|amazing amazing i think it's time for us to do as tim the
data/010990.wav|myself a accomplished chef by most metrics
data/025119.wav|and they made the worst possible ad they
data/002185.wav|it to get this twist job and i got it and i
data/028732.wav|axel these jobs and i'm not going to
data/019071.wav|what i'm saying is i was impressed
data/022918.wav|has that changed he's basically saying  you
data/015332.wav|more money than the the biggest season of game of thrones the most expensive on wheel of time currently and no one's even talking about it okay they are throwing an absolutely ludicrous amount of money into the market to try and get
data/013316.wav|which makes me think i shouldn't trust
data/027735.wav|are they all doing skate based puns for
data/010562.wav|i would rather i would rather it would be safer no i don't want to go back to league of legends no i don't want to do it absolutely not
data/029203.wav|ads like take small breaks every now and then
data/008461.wav|chic i lost it i lost the shake i lost it i lost the shake i
data/015812.wav|i start buying influencers they'll start buying
data/023836.wav|but we thought it was a banger so we all commented on it saying how great it was and then the artist reached out to me he was an
data/008646.wav|and if they just openly gave it to him i think guaranteed he pays the billion for sure but i think more likely it's between
data/032099.wav|well idea i was just thinking who is ron do i know
data/020580.wav|i pray for that guy damn it man i just bought this game on pc today i want you to know that i like this game
data/023135.wav|you about the source of those tasty delicious luxury treats the dolphin fish this is a perfectly innocuous name and in fact this fish has nothing to
data/019312.wav|they have to start a company where they compete against each other in a marketplace selling laptops it was like a complete marketing game designed from the ground up
data/019986.wav|we're doing terribly marvel at the time it was acquired had one movie in marvel studios iron man and most of
data/000609.wav|there is a rebellion there's betrayal
data/013111.wav|it's don't bring a whole seat because you'll only need the edge
data/026556.wav|of course god gamer but they so far it has remained
data/004654.wav|i'm a lot excited for the weekend you know a busy week and all that blah
data/024556.wav|because apple does not want their biggest apps pushing you to the web to to get rid of the cut but here's the
data/019466.wav|i have to say this but everyone in chat saying she's very hot and sex sells i don't think
data/015028.wav|if you're busy like me going to the video store is a hassle
data/024599.wav|it's pretty clever probably wasn't too expensive and uh and not only did it get
data/021207.wav|well netflix that was wrong netflix is not going
data/001959.wav|the on discord okay i i'll be honest with you if it's not at the top of my discord right now i won't see it because there's too many
data/013774.wav|here because i was worried that they were going to be even in more trouble after a leak came out this week that they were shredding documents related to their abuse investigation yeah this came out but who cares about this because bro overwatch mobile could be happening yeah
data/003926.wav|and i appreciate that thank you for the prime
data/002229.wav|the actual real questions that everyone else no one else had the balls to ask
data/019022.wav|it's almost real right here they don't have controversial opinions they have very brand safe opinions in fact all they care about is your brand and
data/016534.wav|when every tournament in every game for years if you won every tournament in
data/008446.wav|so uninterested i would literally run the wrong way all the time like i would have no i would have no concept of what team i was on what the goal what what you know where we're going and i would
data/016946.wav|can buy partial amounts of a share for up to
data/027122.wav|the government just printing a bunch of

data/015414.wav|what if you are a family that
data/012383.wav|and you're talking to them but if you've been really good
data/018562.wav|we got pc for extra cash they don't see pc as a threat which means the pc value proposition to
data/026680.wav|of all the teams people are gonna have to spend millions more bits on their aces high london spitfire cheer modes only it turns out people don't spend money watching esports events they don't subscribe they'll give their money to
data/008340.wav|i turned into a joke and then you don't get your real answer are you

data/001706.wav|well i'll be interested to hear more
data/030019.wav|the already he's a good guy i'm
data/009909.wav|i'll turn down the money then you're
data/023710.wav|local recruiters might have tried it
data/029933.wav|where i was saying like you know of all the sets that i loved
data/023003.wav|and said look we get it hey you want to make fat stacks we're going to do a store pretty soon we're going to make and said look we get it hey you wanna make fat stacks we're gonna do a store pretty
data/016358.wav|the the hundreds of billions of dollars a vast amount of
data/001864.wav|oh he's busy that day that month so we'll see we'll get it we'll get
data/013489.wav|better at it i know for a
data/024321.wav|it says a weird line it
data/016771.wav|we're having the highest deaths ever so we're
data/001185.wav|i don't know i know it's not canada because
data/019138.wav|they have had some commercials of their
data/025300.wav|but not for netflix just like conor subs
data/010865.wav|keep coming at me it only makes me stronger that's actually giga chad
data/010983.wav|in their new partnership with minions so
data/005087.wav|let me see what i pulled up i bought in some
data/023794.wav|where you've got like you know asthma
data/030992.wav|in like uh i've seen mobster movies
data/023988.wav|what it costs us okay i think a lot of the takes i saw
data/011514.wav|i said actually if you really look into it this could be a really good thing
data/007067.wav|i got to meet a lot of people
data/010576.wav|he has a unique ability to want to leave a room that he's in and the second i open
data/012316.wav|hear me out it costs five racks so it should be if not more so like the thing is is that i kept thinking like this is pretty cool then i thought
data/005459.wav|it was because there was a huge crowd of people shoving us and we were moving but again she looks like
data/016281.wav|i can trust with that it is almost certainly c d project oh oh they did the exact same thing for
data/000088.wav|the obviously don't get me wrong i like ari
data/031629.wav|and i remember i sat next to
data/013800.wav|thinking about what's on screen at all
data/006305.wav|nine and then we go right
data/017891.wav|touch points in the purchase and post
data/001422.wav|your profile picture is a sad pepe
data/024561.wav|are saying like even if you went to the
data/016375.wav|i did seven applications last night and
data/018659.wav|so in the gaming industry for seven years now
data/005106.wav|i have a twenty five months you lori on for the 25 months
data/009434.wav|i just give it a second to be honest if i'm
data/009315.wav|you know and i think it's been shown
data/000163.wav|if the the tacky a guy then irritated whose work gets crazy we if the the tacky okay then
data/025040.wav|an orange julius dominoes and dominoes
data/031118.wav|we'd run race on stream and still beat him by like
data/016652.wav|this has led to many opportunities if you're interested in battery technology battery maker
data/010290.wav|get her on the team um if
data/013785.wav|nobody made this game here's the new
data/019042.wav|i mean this is crap they don't they have a million followers but nobody cares now people are saying you'll never touch her or meter like
data/003714.wav|it's basically use them as r
data/004868.wav|about the idea that anyone working remotely is stealing from the company i think he said
data/016172.wav|you know so i figured i might as well keep
data/012566.wav|worried about public and and i use public everyday but i've mentioned this i i sign up for public before i got the worried about public and and i use public every day but i've mentioned this i i signed
data/014870.wav|get a gryffindor please god let's not get a
data/015045.wav|got more expensive which means it
data/011804.wav|it'd be quite honest it looks exactly
data/004630.wav|your the other day by the way okay i got a cold call
data/020427.wav|that's what i'm talking about though that's why i have been so unimpressed with pepsi's marketing because this is this is their whole strategy as of the past few years actually for the longest time you see
data/025245.wav|chinese psychic for content oh no
data/010135.wav|if the for women until they have a daughter like i
data/026067.wav|and from a small share to now they are literally
data/004586.wav|it's got here yeah that's what i did that's what
data/024159.wav|if the stream for half a year and then come back and then and then even though he didn't tell them
data/025158.wav|we can bring it back now i promise you we're
data/018578.wav|yeah you could buy both yes they could be
data/005721.wav|so but yeah he had also headed to like
data/018728.wav|and so what we have now is better games if rachel buys and a playstation okay and joins the blue man group ross and chandler are gonna buy it too so they can game with her okay and eventually they're all gonna buy it whoever gets out to an early lead snowballs this has been proven for every console generation i was
data/010029.wav|you could say that at any time
data/024621.wav|well goods that we all just tacitly consider to be just as valuable if not more so than physical goods and fashion in the digital realm for our digital avatars is going to be where they make a majority of their money long story short if you don't have fortnite
data/017259.wav|if you are a billionaire you should be above the law i'm sorry to say it but we all think it it's true let's get back to what this country's built on billionaires living like gods among the rest of us okay god hopefully we can hopefully
data/022498.wav|huh marketing mondays ago today i'm
data/026822.wav|one day what triggered that well i've been talking about it for 30 minutes
data/015577.wav|started declining a little bit because everyone
data/015353.wav|the problem is twitch pays you out all
data/025741.wav|we don't do it all which is
data/001953.wav|watch the video could be better if i just did this
data/006225.wav|of my friends big any tips
data/004596.wav|and so i can get on the other one but i'm sure it's only going to last a few
data/018609.wav|that being said it's still very likely this game
data/020304.wav|this is my recommended we landed on a solid
data/021264.wav|is is rippering out of the gate they
data/030290.wav|yes i put a ring on it yes i
data/018642.wav|do you think there's a conflict in competition in
data/008484.wav|i know you know that's more threatening you know what i'm
data/011299.wav|let me reset and then let me call clara
data/003320.wav|to take part in the great resignation and switch jobs i think i actually
data/012804.wav|in better but i wasn't clever enough so i was just i
data/004052.wav|ash by working for you okay what you need
data/001964.wav|waffle maker did i have a stroke or is that what you said
data/016979.wav|okay i do love those keys
data/018633.wav|and they um they play games
data/028206.wav|we need a guy at twitch whose entire job
data/024622.wav|let's get to the final win and this is a really important win like this
data/026253.wav|worth more than the entire net worth of elon
data/029463.wav|when i'm like okay yeah cuber was great what about the
data/009145.wav|hold out to the woke mob
data/000381.wav|knights of gambling i've ever had in my entire life in my entire life on this earth i have never been so lucky it felt like i had bachelor party luck
data/001903.wav|and youtube makes more than my job youtube is
data/027680.wav|can you afford it yes we'll see how the debt holds up what will happen it can't get much worse i think that remains to be seen but as a company it's been holding
data/002509.wav|us today so i will have time i was thinking i would play elden ring or something after i'm done i
data/023355.wav|show that they really do not like cross-play at all they openly fight it they hate it they don't want it to happen and now they are finally insisting no we
data/015530.wav|that makes them a ton of money and so
data/014353.wav|in music or anything they want
data/009966.wav|until mitch mcconnell finally relents they might actually make some progress he might break down you might do anything to shut
data/026037.wav|wartime hiring of shipbuilders in world war ii amazon is
data/028782.wav|this question and i knew if they asked me what i currently make i was going to say
data/006032.wav|it was crazy it was like dude i was like dude are you
data/014817.wav|this is a ghost recon nft
data/032240.wav|when entire life i think aiden says
data/029873.wav|like yo dude like i'm trying to get better at my sheet gimps can you give me any tips
data/024773.wav|get rid of that okay the first spend is the hardest and i saw a video by a game developer describing it as like an
data/010923.wav|are you a little a little
data/000305.wav|night two is where the real magic
data/011996.wav|it was almost all guys by the way
data/006005.wav|did i literally thought you were you were
data/004348.wav|or whatever i got this bro i swear to god the funniest
data/007282.wav|so let me tell you a little bit about his sets though because i
data/002639.wav|wow i don't feel like that's the one to end on so let's perhaps go back to the well and let's see i need to mix the game up here for the final round someone
data/026905.wav|what works right now i think their agency
data/026784.wav|what the positive snowball effects that are one of the reasons that
data/024931.wav|we skill-based i made that mistake myself a to skill based i made that mistake myself a
data/013633.wav|you're investing in the future of hulu
data/003885.wav|there are underestimating trump's ability to say
data/016096.wav|the regularly scheduled vacation do you think
data/027603.wav|certainly coming back in some form or another there's another major concern here number one is the employee reactions
data/029198.wav|please is the dude who made it rich now
data/002891.wav|if the to liquidate quite a bit of tesla shares
data/001449.wav|get smarter again the game you guys couldn't answer
data/013604.wav|it's like leonard was carrying a huge
data/005662.wav|be more degenerate maybe she's uh i guess
data/006943.wav|is your birthday messages and i see them and i appreciate them i really do you know it's hard turning
data/018964.wav|and you could only watch it on mobile so literally you have to watch with perfect rapt attention chance the rapper try to be ashton kutcher
data/004153.wav|i am in a unique position where i can be disappointed on both sides of the coin rare rare rare spot to be in zachary
data/023009.wav|that's essentially what happened apple is so big that even fortnite in the height of
data/012777.wav|and he would come and sit on my couch at my dorm and be like bro we should start
data/019543.wav|we know what it's bottom of b because i actually think it
data/003343.wav|like depressing one okay but it's it's it i just i
data/001603.wav|well i know that are in my situation they're
data/024126.wav|it was a video on his leave to youtube hello
data/019040.wav|we don't like it leave i like this let's just pull up like honda
data/026762.wav|to you know figure out their next few
data/024892.wav|the the finish leveled up so you have to finish the level though so
data/002654.wav|i god what a profile picture that is
data/028852.wav|i'm like i'll remember this like oh this pushy is
data/002437.wav|so it was worth it and i'm excited to finish i think i could now finally
data/014029.wav|let's talk about the streaming wars today a big announcement my friend ludwig went to youtube okay he took
data/026785.wav|we asked a winner take all economy
data/003669.wav|but because of the fact that the son of the
data/013806.wav|many moons ago when microsoft bought bethesda it was right here there is no replacement
data/002751.wav|google engineers that work on the
data/027736.wav|know how um our favorite person in the world
data/019710.wav|let's go into the wins and fails
data/002175.wav|then any hobbies that were overlaps with mine
data/027856.wav|well bunch of like financial trickery and algorithm trickery that doesn't actually work when
data/032299.wav|it was very heartwarming to see
data/025405.wav|if the funny if i live react to it on stream so despite the fact that it's been many many days now i actually i swear hand to god i have not watched this ad it's
data/008769.wav|twitter has the upper hand this legal
data/004522.wav|by the way good birthday date
data/002674.wav|share with you so let's see how much of it you can get chocolate marxism we're
data/022024.wav|what the down you get the call dude unfortunately you can't really delete all of the print ads you made for your clever campaign that are now rolled out in magazines across the country i cannot believe they got this
data/023989.wav|all these guys are stupid they don't know that only that
data/021247.wav|i've done other videos on this subject where i was a little bit more neutral the data is clear
data/010467.wav|like most people on twitter who suddenly are against it
data/025723.wav|seeing for the strategy on that one is the concept is being an advertisement at all we're
data/020376.wav|research shows people remember commercials with nostalgia so to help you remember that liberty mutual customizes your home insurance
data/017730.wav|this part of the clock has led to outsized
data/015801.wav|listen i actually i mean i think netflix is just
data/007883.wav|a few months ago and then you
data/001629.wav|that's not what we want to do
data/001012.wav|after meals she's always telling me off stream that she eats factor meals
data/002935.wav|would have been really and then chris evans is good
data/020699.wav|of artificial preservatives of not having them means nothing when all you're
data/030463.wav|i got a full body tattoo right so on the front it said will you and on the back it was supposed to say this is embarrassing it was supposed to say marry me but it said
data/004818.wav|in children with one of his employees at
data/000148.wav|and i put them on ebay or they do sell and 30
data/011876.wav|there is a event happening and you are part of the play it's larping yeah yeah i didn't know it's going
data/012644.wav|the thursday we'll probably do best tweets
data/002377.wav|actual advice please do not do anything related
data/005921.wav|i about that dude how do we not
data/018419.wav|i hated it that is the worst way to position your new service only fans watch out for it
data/017790.wav|it was a thing for a while but
data/025139.wav|once a month but people will tag
data/018971.wav|it's not just a shorter episode secondly they didn't understand their competitors so their competitors were this
data/005212.wav|this weekend i would say this weekend pretty impactful pretty impactful for me more than any other streamer okay it's like yes did ludwig host a gigantic
data/012695.wav|must be some problems too the riot fighting
data/008284.wav|so you honestly if it tastes good or not
data/029720.wav|in the clutch up and he's gonna he's
data/023723.wav|it's somewhere that's my only note but
data/028492.wav|so i just got this private off oh my god so now i want the private to stay so i
data/020604.wav|the subscriber i hope i am proud to present to you a live performance of the autozone jingle by peter scott aka king delroy take it away
data/027076.wav|well that anyway with that that is our
data/018422.wav|well what's good and bad who's
data/015572.wav|and it turns out that roku has been actually quite successful during the pandemic uh right around the
data/018906.wav|because as you heard from that intro this was marketed at the younger generation the idea was that zoomers specifically
data/021251.wav|the creator named erac he kind of blew up
data/008818.wav|forty percent because he first started talking about
data/029896.wav|it on venice beach yeah it was amazing we're all drinking having
data/003918.wav|i was voting for bernie so i wanted bernie to
data/001218.wav|and you are extra good at
data/005082.wav|great and then now i'll pull
data/028533.wav|and i'm just going everyone i call
data/018742.wav|in one thousand dollars for an iphone blah blah blah
data/022151.wav|you might think i would tell you
data/001732.wav|fast would take for the ship
data/007000.wav|which is really cool i've never had that happen before
data/031272.wav|instantly freeze i panic i freeze and what he sees is a youngish looking guy in a business suit hacking into orange julius it looks like i'm i'm committing
data/007529.wav|for the for the for the possible sponsorship because he knows
data/009368.wav|of damage there taking out the misfortune could be a very good
data/000406.wav|cards and whatever so in between hands of pai
data/015703.wav|like lily can really help with that so if you are interested please check them out in the
data/024642.wav|one portion of that of their giant growth in gdp has been real estate construction so like if you're a small city in china you can make more money just selling land to real estate developers than
data/005389.wav|you could yeah you could invest in the market while you're
data/007494.wav|i used to it wasn't a soup it was not a soup
data/027302.wav|this is what they talk about in their
data/023477.wav|if they can increase their strategy there's two different strategies
data/030258.wav|and i i cobble together some cleaning
data/027283.wav|by showing you godric the grafted in a
data/009874.wav|easier quicker cheaper faster than i can get from like
data/001476.wav|but i don't have any questions prepared
data/005580.wav|if the pizzas cutie orders 50
data/014286.wav|would have a big impact and i think youtube's
data/002814.wav|though there is plenty of evidence both from the wall street journal and other reputable sources that says not only did he do it but that he publicly
data/010528.wav|well so we'll figure it out we'll discuss
data/008466.wav|or day at the office not my longest sub
data/018651.wav|at the acquired that's where discord is right now i bet you get discord for about one to two
data/018907.wav|would be all over this largely because of their attention span let me talk to you about these two people can i show if you were thinking who's the right
data/004460.wav|at honest uh if you count
data/031485.wav|in playing starcraft seriously for 22
data/015268.wav|the intro that quack got me
data/019945.wav|that's five billion dollars and to put that into scale
data/015686.wav|need the combined half of each other's uh
data/027145.wav|every single administration knows that it that there's a problem that inflation is starting to get worse and worse and worse but they also know that if they are the ones to pull the plug on the
data/011445.wav|nine hours to ireland i'd ask you to
data/029907.wav|i believe high standards for himself and where his his shortcomings come from is when he projects those high standards on other people so
data/009958.wav|what if i pay like tommy in it to like object at my wedding and then i sword fight him you'll never guess which youtuber sword
data/028225.wav|it's pretty split behind the scenes over
data/020974.wav|you guys to take a look and tell me maybe we'll watch this ad and think it can't be
data/007816.wav|the slides together if i have a jeff bezos
data/026060.wav|he needs it though can i just give a win for a second to someone who's been
data/018390.wav|is porn porn is one of the industries
data/024346.wav|is a big thumbs down and it's so expensive what
data/009712.wav|play hitman and i'll give your new video
data/028539.wav|but nerd the guy ended up
data/009989.wav|is here or allies stan snapped on that one stands could never do you is here we're allies stan snapped on that one stance could
data/020780.wav|getting get a get a getting kidding kidding kidding kidding kidding
data/018650.wav|if you think about where twitch was when it got
data/023612.wav|you can't hang out with anybody stops her from having children in relationships
data/024062.wav|is well aware that like if they don't go adult they don't make any money anyway i hope that
data/006056.wav|i had a whole plan dude i was like i got a
data/020185.wav|think no matter what take it anymore
data/021948.wav|and this woman in the meeting like laughed at one of my slides and said that's not a strategy
data/004631.wav|usually this happens more often when nvidia stock is up
data/008837.wav|well like you'd have to pay or

data/027651.wav|it's it already didn't make much sense and it's
data/021276.wav|years that are just what makes twitch and youtube way ahead of the pack okay one of those features that has kept
data/030710.wav|if the wrong dude the heaviest building in the world is

data/018159.wav|hurry before the iconic baseline kicks
data/029348.wav|it's were some of the the studio
data/015040.wav|you're at home and it was successful this was their this was their big
data/011859.wav|is that you have your own space because you
data/014068.wav|the platforms youtube twitch and mixer were on the scene okay
data/020973.wav|with this particular ad i would love for you
data/010735.wav|thank god oh thank the heavens
data/023432.wav|my average demographic and thinking about myself
data/003048.wav|we we've called all day today they don't answer we
data/008223.wav|and it means that there's just no shot in hell that he can be re-elected and that
data/020196.wav|took a turn they wanted the twitter public to tell their experiences at
data/023742.wav|the audio quality it's all great
data/004540.wav|okay tell you what it's a little late for him so maybe
data/013718.wav|what he sexually harasses women if it's valid if it's
data/018692.wav|and they didn't want that and so they
data/011087.wav|nah that's not true but it's funny that you think that
data/012842.wav|he thinks i made the entire
data/010289.wav|want to waste her time i wouldn't want to get
data/026241.wav|they do work for example if i was trying to sell my
data/007429.wav|getting to where that yeah it's one thing like
data/027978.wav|they did to invest in crypto not a joke i
data/024082.wav|do there's four lanes i'm hoping we don't
data/029169.wav|undeterred the planners decided to go
data/006624.wav|oh my god i was this close to buying the
data/025320.wav|it's like somebody who made a bunch of money
data/011763.wav|but i don't say that because i'm playing along
data/031438.wav|and stance does not give up he wants the
data/003400.wav|oh dude i don't even want to go into it
data/005953.wav|i like this happened they want him
data/001644.wav|it oh wow this is a cute cat people have been discord
data/015847.wav|cable dies the minute the last boomer
data/002169.wav|and and you know just subtly
data/022563.wav|a subtle reminder the green glove treatment that you've been waiting for
data/010464.wav|and said he's down to join your squad that's the thing though i'm kind of on an
data/023891.wav|mango winning crazy storyline tons of
data/018487.wav|billion dollars one of the largest acquisitions in the gaming space ever for reference let me try to draw you up
data/023181.wav|boxes literally it's filled with glue and it helps the food stick in the right spot for photography and it looks like it has more of a shine
data/024868.wav|are most susceptible to becoming a whale you need to be the most careful when entering a mobile
data/000459.wav|well i'm not kidding it must have been a a busy weekend in
data/013628.wav|i was gonna do marketing monday today on literal streaming wars between like netflix and disney plus and hulu and
data/010412.wav|but at least you have some ability to switch
data/017481.wav|your own life have a chance to support these
data/021800.wav|act together and then the great people at the jeep corporation to save this great country with the most powerful
data/009392.wav|well as much as tyler won
data/001205.wav|i never wanted it again i like avoided it
data/022347.wav|this is what peak mail performance looks
data/024008.wav|there's like a law where if a bank is found to have harbored money that is funneled through any illegal activity they can receive massive massive fines and penalties okay so
data/021877.wav|this is also a real photo jeff bezos uses billions of dollars to get a cameo on star trek his favorite
data/023880.wav|listen there's gonna be some positive
data/002883.wav|so that what he loses the court case he spends a smaller amount of money it's actually a very unique rail an interesting so that when he loses the court case he spends a smaller amount of money
data/006782.wav|if the for being not big
data/023015.wav|they went around apple's review store of
data/012656.wav|it's on your mother and her proclivities in the bedroom it is a very in-depth presentation with video so i would not show up if you don't want to really learn the details but
data/005868.wav|i did have a conversation with
data/011512.wav|i said in a recent video i said
data/015372.wav|because they're just not as attractive the best
data/027061.wav|let me tell you something you know what's
data/026814.wav|and they made this massive pivot to the metaverse and if we're being honest is is a buzzword right now it's a joke it doesn't exist nobody's using a vr headset to go talk to their their boys the
data/028123.wav|not really well established like face is actually very long slow expensive process but for a while during the
data/030842.wav|he specifically and can i perhaps leverage that into a job walk me through this finn actually
data/022944.wav|pull their access to it that would be illegal or at least a cause for you know
data/009100.wav|how to fix that for you okay i can't hand deliver you a better volume knob and turn it up that's something you have to deal with yourself
data/011532.wav|just picture of ludwig it's his place thing
data/017177.wav|as an excuse for the next eight months anything i choose not to do for the next eight months will be because i had covered that one time okay i want you guys
data/024442.wav|jumping out you know what i'm saying
data/029195.wav|was the biggest stream that twitch it had i'm pretty sure in history at the time
data/001594.wav|i have no more questions and this bullying of children has been brought to you by the fine folks at factory meals
data/028823.wav|so you might realize let's say you're a young
data/031888.wav|the first girl i was thinking about asking to
data/014108.wav|these these two years are the
data/006729.wav|she asked me to decide something
data/016074.wav|that means and use a social media branch approach what so my first case study is
data/023220.wav|i literally my food pyramid if i were to draw it let me
data/019336.wav|we contentious for reasons you will soon see people were not clapping at the end of our presentation and i will show you why every
data/011621.wav|the she gets way into it more than me so like i introduced her for example in the lord
data/020172.wav|it just stop relating stop stop
data/031489.wav|that's how deep starcraft is there is no
data/014652.wav|getting not on a wednesday it's not marketing though is it right it's marketing
data/001761.wav|point of the tim burton remake seems to be that it would do what the video is
data/017570.wav|and stronger than anyone else's so this is where the yep clock model comes in please give me your yep clocks okay and this divides
data/016098.wav|i think you're a bit too worried about your face and not enough
data/015808.wav|but they're they're on the way out
data/007476.wav|i have a burger i just i don't yeah so she really warned me off of
data/005065.wav|just good judgment and you know generally except the
data/010657.wav|when the whiteboard and it was just me and him and so it was it was serious
data/001638.wav|an official website where you have submit
data/026263.wav|to the fact that they have a world-class brand
data/003731.wav|make motion and if enough people get angry
data/017750.wav|from their own consumers it is a proven phenomenon where car companies will run ads not even to attract new buyers but to make buyers that spent money on their car feel better about it so they're just stuck in this mindset and it's one of the most inexpensive
data/013921.wav|i now pay later and apparently this type of payment system is extremely popular
data/001443.wav|active for supporting the stream and the
data/024009.wav|with the adult industry altogether for example you can't buy a subscription to pornhub with a visa or mastercard that's why i use for my
data/017269.wav|public domain you can make this cool matrix poo you can draw weird poo rule
data/032237.wav|is that how they afford this opulent casino is this whole thing rigged so that i lose money despite being the greatest
data/031187.wav|with the gym streams and the walk
data/019794.wav|so cool man it had everything people wanted i
data/019409.wav|because you know what if i had a team of more people they would have outvoted me on the quarter six
data/023350.wav|at frisbee throw it's insane so
data/006771.wav|when they got stands to even
data/015050.wav|let's pivot to streaming so they started a dual service where they kept the dvd rental service but they also added free streaming it was called watch now you could open up your your
data/032145.wav|i'm just at the atm thank god my bank says no you can't withdraw two thousand dollars randomly so i get
data/003450.wav|the it makes apples chips it makes nvidia's
data/023964.wav|well the only fans and what my thoughts are i'm
data/028936.wav|also the way the the way the bathroom i couldn't throw up in the toilet is what yeah like he had gotten me a also the way the the way the bathrooms were i couldn't throw up in the toilet
data/025298.wav|it just continue to grow people don't really churn out like you don't buy netflix watch queen's gambit and then say okay
data/002220.wav|if you've been listening to what i've been saying
data/028252.wav|while a good scores but there was one thing left to do and that's check references okay now i happen to know some people that work at
data/015741.wav|signs up with a free trial they watch it and the company reports to wall street we got insane subscriber growth everything is looking great a
data/030104.wav|if the kid right you know
data/003324.wav|seven for those who stayed at
data/012027.wav|so they give you a lightsaber but it's
data/016921.wav|if you can get six months
data/012613.wav|but i think they have potential there
data/019654.wav|a friend of mine he was like
data/003904.wav|or candidate so if you want to be that
data/009756.wav|as if he's john travolta in nicholas cage's
data/011045.wav|i trying to see if i should end a seven year best friend relationship or not you're trying to see what what what
data/012588.wav|disney has passed netflix as the most subscribed streamer in three
data/015945.wav|why everyone else has kind of struggled at
data/012048.wav|instead of this line the wall just kind of glows in the direction of
data/024493.wav|into the day we're not gonna accept the result
data/004910.wav|by their own shareholders myself included because we were all standing to get a
data/032333.wav|but claims to have done so legitimately i counted a total of seven attempts on
data/010508.wav|be honest i know you will be
data/020683.wav|i honestly hadn't even heard of this game before
data/032069.wav|the one who wouldn't submit anything
data/023554.wav|get pissed what amazon does they lower the prices they keep
data/022670.wav|intro because today is the top five times companies lit billions of dollars on fire the five worst
data/025639.wav|i think about it that could work for everyone and if you're hungry right now
data/030322.wav|so this is probably the video that
data/016945.wav|in fractional shares so if you don't want to buy
data/019614.wav|it's is good boys thank you for watching
data/010948.wav|all right now here we go we got a video for you i got a video for you i think the cooldown is five minutes but i am not a hundred percent
data/014543.wav|do you think it's possible for someone like otto to get a job at i didn't see
data/024785.wav|it's crystals primo gems intertwined fate a quiet fate star glitter star dust and more you buy primo
data/019745.wav|it it definitely sounds like that
data/010943.wav|a little bit and so i will be
data/021694.wav|we can't give you back those 30 seconds
data/014310.wav|number one twitch prime twitch prime is a great way a ton of free money for creators at
data/030642.wav|are in it they start asking questions so it's questions like they start out pretty simple it's like i
data/018241.wav|they might have green screened it
data/031644.wav|as well but this guy was the korean translator but he didn't speak that great english he was their translator but he wasn't a
data/012030.wav|is i didn't have enough of these videos ready to go even though they would tell you everything i need to tell you
data/014551.wav|streaming group that youtube did reach out to me i can
data/006183.wav|fuck off i said listen buddy if i don't get my
data/011733.wav|but the first people we encounter
data/028161.wav|one thing that was very interesting to me is that they have extremely high
data/031074.wav|yeah this i can tell that he's like
data/011607.wav|when i don't know i it makes me feel like
data/001672.wav|what's that marketing campaign to build audience fans in america and they've done it they've legitimately done it
data/023825.wav|but i'll give it a shot
data/026713.wav|day and leave again this is the amount he stands to make i
data/013775.wav|california expanding their discrimination lawsuit because not only
data/009207.wav|there is no shortcut it's very mechanics based i tried watching esports and i couldn't follow a single thing
data/014153.wav|more streamers every day content's getting
data/005808.wav|the ability to like not to give my friend a chance to still have
data/009862.wav|i think i have a unique experience
data/027250.wav|his brand of having the most boring skinner boxy in open world games if
data/000484.wav|and i stare at the alarm clock and it is
data/012910.wav|he just has had a cool life and he's
data/002504.wav|the coffee shops and like read the documents in the back and start to piece
data/007573.wav|but overall i'll say it was a good time it was a good time and uh i did enjoy
data/012445.wav|with me out when i'm a big shot i'm
data/009929.wav|you guys have asked me that every time about
data/016493.wav|what you're in an industry that's growing if you have a wind behind you instead of against you
data/021739.wav|we cringe into one that's like in on the joke but
data/009934.wav|to the chat though it won't matter because you
data/000903.wav|somebody at him and then i could tag him
data/011354.wav|what of them on the subject no okay come on
data/000318.wav|so we had a bunch of
data/017741.wav|tesla which doesn't do almost any pre-purchase advertising but as excellent you know
data/018414.wav|otherwise you might die you may cringe right out of your chair into
data/006342.wav|if the for everything obviously all the stuff you've done for
data/009163.wav|the anything else before it i'll
data/009165.wav|the most important thing is that when you get a one out of ten video and you go to your dashboard it pops confetti everywhere like you're scrolling through your dashboard
data/015199.wav|south america squid games from korea they're making all these shows over the world and
data/005641.wav|and no big deal and but yeah
data/008407.wav|i wouldn't don't let her boss you around
data/009878.wav|if your income's still denominated in
data/020885.wav|because chances are to get a
data/005478.wav|i don't even know if we're even related i actually legitimately
data/021912.wav|to get started it doesn't want to move no part of this is easy
data/013388.wav|and it's way way more convenient
data/028136.wav|it'll billion dollars they had a bunch of articles
data/018319.wav|or stock now on the public markets
data/012145.wav|his character like the most nice
data/025856.wav|the credits and like to travel for the blizzard
data/019554.wav|i would love the story i wonder if i
data/010158.wav|like that i don't really care but
data/017911.wav|versus other movies okay generally the way a movie works they have some sort of hype trailer they get
data/019432.wav|so really you're just trying to get these in order if your jingle isn't catchy the whole thing is moot it has to be catchy and then from there you try to fit in as much as you can
data/001827.wav|city of the future but the problem is even though they have near infinite wealth near infinite wealth is not infinite wealth and to build a perfect city of
data/009604.wav|they're just gonna dive on him
data/016125.wav|i have a lot of stuff planned for the new
data/002525.wav|luna dubs once heads flip again let's go
data/028744.wav|of any human being alive he played
data/021838.wav|all the way back to 1997
data/031802.wav|freight train and blew up massively these are the three
data/011671.wav|but it's supposed to be it's supposed to be a spaceship
data/017545.wav|that is worth more than the entire net worth of elon musk every single bitcoin in existence at the current market cap the entirety of walmart the entirety of target the entirety of boeing the entirety of coca-cola own every nfl
data/012328.wav|in the thing having a stupid name did bother
data/014228.wav|and there are there's there's so many more on
data/022600.wav|was had an xbox like red ring of deathing
data/027810.wav|what it would lead to the bubble popping so they
data/017332.wav|with 'em to have to uh match
data/026163.wav|making the right moves this is what fans have been asking for
data/001597.wav|now now eight months i think
data/018035.wav|called pepsi for some reason for some reason
data/017361.wav|well children to touch live plugs with pennies this really happened i don't know what caused it i don't know but this is a true story this actually happened i thought it was fake i looked into it it
data/010938.wav|probably the most important thing you can win
data/022903.wav|you're okay with what happened losing imperfection of a craft when you stop getting angry
data/013734.wav|be doing it he called a bomb threat to
data/001395.wav|it would be a bad idea five minutes ago and then you guys all said good one
data/002767.wav|with the prime your local cat made think of the prime austin david
data/018413.wav|actual cringe alert it's the only way to get through this whole
data/009583.wav|but you're right right right right right i forgot
data/000151.wav|it does not sound although there are some
data/011325.wav|got about chat we're here to a truck what
data/011448.wav|everything that i read that's of any
data/022985.wav|if any way that you could pay on that app without using apple pay without using
data/023374.wav|and figure it out yourself cause i'm stumped and so i instantly
data/017101.wav|i will be interested only because how did
data/002961.wav|kind have spent more everyone's feeding for the
data/015342.wav|you know there's a thing called skin in the game netflix has skin in the game the content
data/004022.wav|i feel good to see you pleasure pleasure
data/021564.wav|the tomorrow but you could probably hold if you buy tomorrow and
data/013361.wav|in this hypothetical example this is actually a chug jug you've called me out on it and i'm mad because
data/020466.wav|a little bit buggy there's a lot of reasons
data/021027.wav|southwest airlines want to get away
data/024310.wav|the finer things in life it's the hottest fires that make the
data/005154.wav|and i got dualies of the
data/021077.wav|i don't want to get pregnant right this ad appeals to that age
data/014000.wav|add and sell a bunch of them and i did it
data/016758.wav|it's absolutely insane to me that people think that closing off immigration will benefit the country we're in at all
data/026746.wav|that being said could they do another one after this no and that
data/030174.wav|what grade oh my god i'm telling oh no well
data/003120.wav|and warehouse workers and delivery drivers are not included yeah
data/030670.wav|i don't even know how to say
data/024560.wav|it could still ask you for a cut like we're not
data/010605.wav|i cannot cannot must not curse today i need my i need to be squeaky clean and
data/030699.wav|he was up there in second place
data/019393.wav|we determine on a game level what stuff was most valuable like an actual match-up chart and we
data/027316.wav|very difficult having something that is universally recognized as difficult can give them a sense of superiority or satisfaction that other games cannot and this is probably the dark side of it
data/016325.wav|that probably boosted sales in ireland though i gotta be honest
data/004802.wav|the call it off and pay the billions
data/014578.wav|it's getting more dominant they're not going to pay
data/027105.wav|fuck dude it's like what are
data/031760.wav|oh that's gotta be a sub alert that's
data/013100.wav|this guy got ranked 11th and then
data/018494.wav|who tend to stick to a few number of games this one
data/003771.wav|well the gauntlet i have not i have not what is the theory of the gauntlet
data/006877.wav|the most egregious expenses across the company it was crazy dude people expense the wildest wildest
data/017350.wav|okay other i i need to be on this side i want
data/012866.wav|it's like in sophomore year and early junior
data/021128.wav|talk about it it's like impressive i
data/015485.wav|i do that because the world is changing people want this stuff they're
data/032054.wav|the reports that is so much worse this was before
data/015839.wav|it's not it's not surviving no it's
data/002936.wav|but end of the day like i
data/007438.wav|at find him one you know it's
data/022215.wav|that makes you cry to me i'll always prefer to an ad that tries to make you cry by shock value because here's the deal an ad is at most a minute long
data/028664.wav|the hours late for work i don't go to my desk i don't go to a meeting i go to
data/024123.wav|because he's got to go back to his
data/026170.wav|and to read that news thank god blizzard's in
data/015069.wav|they thought they could make a quick buck
data/020013.wav|they should just buy the internet
data/023455.wav|i can't because i can't raise prices i
data/028277.wav|been like i think this guy's kind of odd and he gave
data/025989.wav|well the new year with some with an ode to eating ass yeah anyway i just thought that was a you know we're going to kick of the year off right with some terrible brand well of the new year with some with an ode to eating ass anyway i just thought that was a you
data/017757.wav|well said anything anything that requires money to
data/008220.wav|is that are doing absolutely terrible things so but the problem is just gas prices are high and the economy is doing poorly and this hot potato game that both parties
data/002829.wav|you know hurting their stock price investor confidence employees don't know if
data/028202.wav|for no other reason than like this will be good for the community
data/009170.wav|we get incentivized and then when you get a 10
data/013509.wav|well as is half empty and let
data/015059.wav|and you're ahead of the competition so you get certain key advantages in this case it was that hollywood had no
data/004224.wav|it's like an easy way to get um drake's
data/001486.wav|yeah it's just silent got it
data/031720.wav|is that mean it didn't end
data/022430.wav|photo book is easy for me and for you it's not what other kind the general
data/029696.wav|it was busy so we were in the break room just playing friendlies and i could tell megan was like
data/012861.wav|i have a junior and senior and
data/014971.wav|today it is the most money being spent it has the most competitors as of this
data/004531.wav|people to be critical of crypto and nfds
data/025411.wav|are playing i don't know what this is a futuristic orc fighter they're playing lord of the
data/011339.wav|yeah so thursday probably off to do it
data/024583.wav|twelve million dollars to pay apple back for violating contract and they lost an estimated
data/001276.wav|it's difficult wow we've done a lot okay look at all these game posters
data/004176.wav|into a special type of marketing monday
data/030745.wav|what do you guys think what do you guys think trump the answer was true
data/028888.wav|call me back home safely but apparently one of the first things i did was try to dance with this girl and what
data/008122.wav|wait for black history month actually appreciate
data/025987.wav|the immediately saying they were in poor judgment and they already announced from executives saying that
data/025531.wav|that means this war is getting absolutely crazy and a console war means that as long as
data/024220.wav|we're on billboards or or wherever it's just to make most of them were made for the
data/007895.wav|i have gifted and one of them is atrioc
data/014081.wav|it's amazon's very focused on not talking not
data/021149.wav|because you're afraid of raw human sexuality is that what it is will ferrell in his prime
data/004134.wav|while the ring play i'd love to put together a
data/021933.wav|so that's the sort of idea people g i make your
data/022301.wav|this is a business relationship at this point stop playing the victim
data/009938.wav|it is that bad but it is a little bit of bullying like
data/013984.wav|i just wanted you guys to be aware that as my fail of the week is buy now pay
data/017086.wav|with the cringe tweet luckily i like taffo
data/003096.wav|if the that but i'll i'll save it for a second uh
data/001220.wav|and friendly which is a very hard skill
data/020362.wav|not only do the kisses not correspond to any given note the rhythm and the amount of
data/010583.wav|be understanding here you walk up to locked doors and then you
data/028932.wav|in the first weird champ i think diego's face was the pioneer of weird champ i think he gave me the very first i think he was the first person to really like isolate that
data/019256.wav|it's battles which took actually took place in ancient
data/019309.wav|i missed a lot of classes most classes i found to be quite boring and then this class came along this marketing
data/019023.wav|cookies and things that make them relatable things that are brand cookies and things that make them relatable things that are brand safe let's say you want the massive brand reach of a logan paul and you spend a lot of money
data/011574.wav|i've kept his cat off cameras and the second i let stan's cat
data/028152.wav|we're going to get access to when they when they acquired instead they're not
data/000133.wav|co-sponsors at this point you know
data/030857.wav|in going yeah i mean i feel like there'd be talk about salary
data/019285.wav|here is I went through and
data/021986.wav|i want you to personally know that while i think
data/014676.wav|and then one big win but it's not a whole separate thing and then i'm gonna jump right into the
data/009002.wav|much in plain english so while it's long you can skim around and every part is like not
data/027790.wav|it's not like a toothbrush you know
data/024653.wav|real estate companies in china went down 80
data/016155.wav|if someone it's pretty underground story
data/028115.wav|the announced the following they were going public at a 1 billion dollar valuation
data/018595.wav|they don't have to work anymore everyone
data/016662.wav|more and more important every year people that know a lot
data/027825.wav|last year now it's at twelve dollars but
data/031292.wav|well and i was like just like dude
data/028148.wav|his financial update has really cast doubts
data/022699.wav|well ads don't really want to be next to
data/021682.wav|my grass you figured it out
data/015308.wav|we just bought this match anyway because he's
data/003135.wav|the clutches moment of your life
data/023762.wav|do you want from me more how much more successful do you want me to be more successful how many records can my records break
data/010301.wav|hours for me but i've seen a good amount of
data/011945.wav|i can't imagine it wasn't that many people so it helps with the
data/027321.wav|if the way to go back to this gucci belt and i want to talk about why the difficulty
data/032420.wav|yeah so i so i made that video and i said remember a few key tips it's
data/031148.wav|more than any streamer that's the real problem okay and i think other streamers in the same position would have been less generous i think he did a good thing with the mods i think
data/021233.wav|get ready every marketer is getting ready to throw money
data/008728.wav|i can't just be there's a
data/024741.wav|you might notice in the beginning
data/019282.wav|can buy the console anyway you can't increase the maximum it's selling out no
data/021787.wav|we corporation care these times are so trying thank god for
data/003028.wav|in a different theater where there was a
data/026880.wav|bad jokes then we get to the avocados
data/001963.wav|with everything and becoming what you say a
data/004724.wav|you are not the only person that likes listening
data/031413.wav|we're still packing we're packing heat here
data/029932.wav|after this tournament about this set where i
data/009196.wav|went and it came out really well and it did well and
data/021780.wav|what the category this was the ad for it i
data/020428.wav|and then you've got cardi b's twerk shop
data/016285.wav|hold them accountable isn't this kind of
data/022072.wav|there was no difference that's it's the
data/021447.wav|and and at the end of the day gamestop stock is not worth this much that is the core thing that's the reason i didn't do it we're all just trying to be the first one out we're trying to hold it long
data/020849.wav|he starts off by saying i've gotten a lot of bad advice in my
data/010745.wav|dies in a tragic fire left behind by this clip
data/026182.wav|it's the best our human scientists have come up
data/011864.wav|well i mean that part that
data/025362.wav|like they were acting real like um
data/004421.wav|one vacation because he's a billionaire or not a billionaire but a very wealthy
data/008753.wav|and they want to make money we want to sell our
data/024603.wav|fuck month baby the future is truck
data/025555.wav|john deere responded by getting they couldn't get
data/006726.wav|by the way of my dog i don't know the breed
data/005043.wav|truly a great business idea this is actually a
data/008591.wav|so twitter match was basically forcing
data/029170.wav|with their backup plan of a lapras and as a result there were tens of thousands playing at the same time so coordinating movement was pretty much impossible that's huge by the way
data/021155.wav|at crying laughing emoji but i was laughing that's some of the deaths and
data/002384.wav|to play brand new hitman content for the
data/022093.wav|it's super simple this one i i need a i need a better it's a tough one to
data/027127.wav|why going crazy housing prices skyrocketing but the hangover effects of that is that money starts to become less valuable per dollar
data/030682.wav|like he's like yeah he just it didn't you know and my mom
data/025550.wav|we like cheating the system to like
data/019240.wav|outside imagine that now dude imagine that now with
data/026315.wav|the price tags of like a gucci they are the only company in human history
data/000212.wav|i'm drinking so i'm not i don't remember everything but the only
data/018989.wav|and it's sad it's sad because so many people lost money and people that worked there
data/017920.wav|discussion there's an online they spend the money to be the top of twitter to
data/003690.wav|well i don't you know i don't love everyone that says
data/007996.wav|why do you have a job
data/024047.wav|add marketing play to release a bad second
data/020924.wav|we is make it to the lcs be in a season or two and then get
data/025460.wav|it is my dream one day for all jobs be paid in gotcha mechanics i would love if
data/001017.wav|can you please look at my dog in your discord i
data/026256.wav|print valuation of apple apple is phenomenally phenomenally outside successful these are all successful companies and they are nowhere close to what apple
data/029751.wav|and he's just like making sure he gets as many views on like the live premiere and
data/019141.wav|mattered because Sony had found a
data/013835.wav|bit about gaming for all while sony's about
data/004737.wav|where is it going let's find out today let's look in to the twisted
data/028171.wav|i never heard of this guy how important could be this this guy
data/029584.wav|it so it was just cool
data/013809.wav|uncertainty and doubt about it i said look you don't spend seven and a half billion dollars
data/013175.wav|am i gonna play rivers blue on
data/018698.wav|that's not enough they have to grow at least 10 percent they
data/015539.wav|apple tv is is by far
data/021873.wav|when your wife with and i thought well we should
data/016561.wav|but that is happening if you are interested in this field you are in a growing field an interesting field
data/023134.wav|i couldn't find out how successful this was but if you're still enjoying sky prawns in australia i got some bad news for you
data/026343.wav|and packaging when you open the iphone and open the ipad etc you are more likely to feel validated in your purchase
data/006392.wav|wait a few years ago and now all of the sudden they've changed their ways kind of
data/000194.wav|i have friend and i assume that's the squad right and first
data/004888.wav|and the reason i believe that on the other side of the deal is that twitter is basically
data/008383.wav|when all with twitter and elon
data/021411.wav|i mean that's that's a short squeeze the last
data/003247.wav|book would be a billionaire now what a ridiculous and stupid example by
data/026842.wav|well actually pretty great pretty solid for any
data/014953.wav|if you don't have an accountant it basically tracks all your expenses and separates them from business
data/030426.wav|it's like a person like you know how
data/009670.wav|was maybe a little elder ring and then
data/023159.wav|the first tricks marketers will do is it's drastically undercooked that's how they keep it plump so once
data/014167.wav|yeah that's where the beginning of this
data/010582.wav|or meow not if it's locked okay but let me i'm sorry
data/006839.wav|it was uh i didn't get to see a lot
data/019175.wav|don't you telling me in the 90s
data/011269.wav|maybe you should turn that down nah nope
data/030029.wav|what happened what is this content
data/002817.wav|he said there's no way he could have done it because he hasn't even had sex in ages
data/024358.wav|with get his beer do you have to wait to get guinness beer do you have to wait to get
data/031484.wav|trash you could grind i mean
data/026608.wav|in competitors like disney is so funny oh
data/008792.wav|in payment from elon to twitter
data/015233.wav|this is not demand for like um
data/015160.wav|it was such a global phenomenon and importantly
data/018565.wav|my first marketing monday xbox one was a total disaster
data/019391.wav|this leapfrog so this is where jason came in and
data/016750.wav|what actually in fact fertility is dropping dramatically people are literally just having fewer children
data/003518.wav|the humanity got through it and moved
data/004821.wav|the speech on twitter about um
data/006537.wav|our profits in because they're such a big
data/007109.wav|where i could start watching game
data/020438.wav|that's for you to decide is it perfect or is it flawless wanna sprite cranberry it's so funny
data/009857.wav|i mean it's probably not true but
data/026032.wav|it's the last 10 months basically 600
data/008255.wav|and started his own company called juked
data/015164.wav|with it but at the time you know that's cultural impact
data/021664.wav|kind of struggling right now and needs money
data/024864.wav|word that we can't afford to actually add new levels new maps that's expensive that's work so how do we make that fat juicy juicy profit that my friend is the achievers and how do we make money off them convenience this is where the big
data/017961.wav|in in-person time hanging out with friends
data/023625.wav|back to the video how likely are you to recommend windows 10 to a friend or
data/002671.wav|will set you free and you are guaranteed to win money and your number that you have chosen is six six is your number okay chocolate marxism i
data/019608.wav|song become a number one hit as
data/016126.wav|we have a good one i hope everything is everyone's happy healthy hope if you're getting gifts you get what you want
data/001375.wav|join one of them and then i'll pull you up what's your name on discord now everyone's joining
data/029451.wav|one of our new games huh
data/016599.wav|industry and being in industries like
data/026477.wav|we have to look at the wins and the
data/002548.wav|or luck try to get a full aaa game perhaps or do you walk away with an easy
data/019388.wav|next quarter we put them almost entirely out of business by the way this is the one quarter i could find where we didn't have a
data/012470.wav|bunch of food and dessert and
data/004924.wav|as well uh the the stock price has
data/007535.wav|oh it makes me want to vomit
data/006923.wav|if that's the case so i already have a shirt a good marketing monday shirt
data/007670.wav|the only time they're silent is when i actually
data/024260.wav|such a dated reference by the time they that and you'll never look at luxury the same again
data/013491.wav|i think if i was still like i was when i played league
data/019331.wav|it's the computer systems these were the nerdiest kids in class and the most likely to be our competition you have to target certain markets so they made the markets the mercedes
data/031297.wav|and that hubris that hubris comes back
data/016168.wav|me what i'll do is i'll smash my feet
data/021427.wav|got popular was because there's no commission you can trade as many times
data/009686.wav|keep it up keep it up
data/020875.wav|was like yo these places are getting more and more risky every year so insurance rates go up
data/013805.wav|hold up wait a minute let me put some
data/017277.wav|i want to go into public domain at
data/007769.wav|i mean i guess if everyone in the chat takes off their pants in solidarity
data/010895.wav|hashtag minion sweep and by the sister company of factor hello fresh
data/011317.wav|big a confirmed on my end
data/000619.wav|the one of the best weekends ever had
data/004245.wav|you can appreciate forever at 100 x
data/023875.wav|as graveyard of our best and brightest soldiers
data/023276.wav|or whatever and i was like i was like
data/013977.wav|that there is no different and i listen to
data/032183.wav|by the way the rarest thing you can get
data/003839.wav|eighty percent popular in a country that's
data/031196.wav|so the first use of gambit was you know there's canon
data/020975.wav|it can't be topped it's so good to see
data/002369.wav|what it is but at least i'll have two
data/009486.wav|this up he's got extra can blood print
data/003349.wav|and it was kind of buried but he basically said that around six weeks ago they started to see an uptick
data/031380.wav|what i think of and and i'm i'm excited this is my idea of a boat this would be fun uh this is the boat that takes us to the
data/031977.wav|we reached out to the account and i asked because we were looking for
data/014518.wav|is another one i was thinking of but
data/031398.wav|that this was not like a big this was not like a break to bank
data/014042.wav|would try he is a streamer streamer he's an influencers influencer
data/022960.wav|licensing they basically make the engine for like every popular game and they made about
data/001870.wav|some class divisions but we'll see i
data/013258.wav|your mode challenge everyone's doing what is that someone like me conor got
data/031208.wav|oh here it is the secret behind
data/025144.wav|a substantial sum of money to get this
data/018352.wav|do not ask for things in a job negotiation
data/028091.wav|in the fail in a new segment my brand new wins
data/005473.wav|and i just i don't even want to say this
data/024581.wav|well there's just no way to stop it and so that's a pretty much a massive l because not only did epic games have to spend a
data/011047.wav|it feels like it's either obvious or it's not i'm interested
data/004687.wav|his career it'll make you look relatable yeah nothing hits that midwestern facebook mom demo like me saying i'm a coffee cow
data/021506.wav|lot of you just think it's a rich guy with hedges a hedge fund is that it is a rich guy with
data/008706.wav|is true in your head but
data/019976.wav|turn everything around not only did they hire pixar to like
data/007920.wav|if the that i can't argue with that honestly you probably speak for the chat you also i
data/027189.wav|now some of you i guess were two years old
data/021918.wav|then you can pay editors to turn those
data/017510.wav|in my life when i heard that song
data/023126.wav|i thought was funny of what marketers have done so in australia in
data/003949.wav|which streamer would be the best president
data/032006.wav|a lot of people are going to make
data/003268.wav|what cut can i get yeah i
data/000891.wav|course and i'm not talking about the marketing mondays i'm talking about the
data/007831.wav|and then i just put them all together and
data/013465.wav|that's a crazy that's a crazy
data/023361.wav|you know either way there's a
data/004366.wav|out today and my initial first thought was like okay
data/003348.wav|some signals that that's not going to last
data/026451.wav|i go had the big banana for a while he's got a lot of these moments where you feel like you really want to be part of it so whenever you buy the sub you're suddenly
data/032364.wav|obvious reasons okay first of all i completed literally every boss every regular boss hitless on stream
data/017544.wav|means okay so i created this this is
data/010376.wav|i think bloom's chimps is very very
data/017485.wav|well this trend because there's been a pretty much
data/015215.wav|so this is one of the things
data/004168.wav|was two years almost but not quite okay
data/022518.wav|over and over again i literally think that would have
data/030594.wav|we're going to your marketing one yeah i'll do a marketing one yeah i'll do a
data/018401.wav|as a little bit different that's why the bounty wouldn't be helpful
data/007813.wav|want to add a picture of jeff bezos shirtless
data/008955.wav|the like should i sell my shares and then
data/014404.wav|i think essentially ludwig's announcement today
data/000321.wav|well the warehouse with like uh fake walls and
data/014130.wav|they spent a lot of money on that it didn't do anything facebook
data/029402.wav|beg i say mom this is urgent i would not call you for any other reason i need you to put
data/015354.wav|all your money youtube pays all your money
data/013145.wav|with this last of us tv series is a
data/020629.wav|everybody hated it and they ended up having to take it down what a bad bad
data/031158.wav|like they they were watching a man get
data/006304.wav|yeah yeah yeah yeah i'd like to time it so that wins it fails is done like early
data/016861.wav|it's the same thing this is this is uh
data/012258.wav|take the game was pretty fun
data/000611.wav|so german selected really well i had a
data/019730.wav|i get behind the need of a degree and then making that degree cost more and more every year is is a monopoly it's a monopoly on a piece of paper that you need to access and they can keep charging more and more for it so this is the fail
data/013529.wav|mash back then like at all competitively but
data/008839.wav|some forty percent so he's 40
data/024663.wav|access to debt the reason everything is so high right now including me
data/009715.wav|you still give me those things and i give you a thumbs up last chance final offer we'll take it you got yourself a deal
data/017139.wav|do you think there's a scenario where i could write off a twitch sub for my
data/030167.wav|when he whatever and i just i i smoked him and
data/020250.wav|the product and hoping some of that shine will stick to your product so with holiday the number one thing you want to see in a good holiday
data/000947.wav|the factor today by the way i'll
data/012947.wav|it's a meltdown and nvidia had the greatest stock run of like any company
data/006921.wav|in fails baby and i'm gonna do it without delay to be honest i almost skipped
data/013750.wav|better version of this because this one was bad
data/005318.wav|she having a good time super funny guy uh
data/002248.wav|and then they have elon musk who's very well in public
data/005885.wav|as skills carl jacobs seemed to think that he was
data/020872.wav|businesses will not buy a building or an office or anything unless they can get insurance on it they just won't it's too
data/029784.wav|i oh what else did i want to
data/006414.wav|cause you guys know the content on linkedin is so
data/018666.wav|for i'm trying to give you a visual the
data/012907.wav|scar toef everyone was like blizzard
data/016819.wav|i think built for mobile use seeing dramatic and tailwinds is doing quite i think built for mobile use is seeing dramatic um
data/030519.wav|oh yeah we did the parents stuff is father
data/027019.wav|i have forgettable last year budweiser sat out the
data/026173.wav|hey what do you do when your name your brand name is
data/004953.wav|but on monday i think they're gonna tank
data/015777.wav|what that more in future marketing
data/005117.wav|the flag up and the chat demanded
data/024698.wav|if they were a few months away from being totally broke nobody knew yet and what they did was create this just capitalizing on the
data/008502.wav|if musk backs out can i buy twitter musk
data/004198.wav|isn't saying in another universe the intern thing could have gone bad kind of
data/001056.wav|diggity damn hey man i know your wedding is coming up but i think our three year anniversary next month might be a little bit of a big deal i hope you're thinking of our three year anniversary gift mine is really cool to you so
data/015656.wav|help with some predictions of where i think we're going based on these analysis okay
data/016795.wav|now as they enter into a global middle or lower class
data/018427.wav|we'll have to buy the games you have to buy this service and
data/024732.wav|a tough day but we made it
data/021635.wav|let me give you my thoughts this is a good
data/005595.wav|was crazy that would happen it was it was
data/009907.wav|don't rely on people being good whenever you rely on better angels if
data/019284.wav|infinite being a good game is so so so
data/003072.wav|the problem is that my wins and fails lately
data/027263.wav|i issues and i think eldon ring has
data/019043.wav|but the truth is the truth that is enabling this is that the nature of celebrity has changed with social media and the fact
data/023042.wav|and they bundled internet explorer with windows and immediately like overnight like literally overnight
data/018541.wav|trying to make twitch more profitable but
data/006450.wav|this is wild this is wild and it is so powerful and i can't wait
data/030756.wav|i feel it today we're off to a stupid start and that means it's only going to get
data/009133.wav|there's a pretty poorly run company and so everyone hating on elon musk as insane as he is and
data/019374.wav|with enron went from being like a pretty good
data/027038.wav|it's like right up his alley and the concept of
data/018933.wav|want to spend the whole time
data/028864.wav|i can read this you guys know i can read
data/014607.wav|can't comment on how much more they are paying him but they are paying him money and generally not for his contract
data/015267.wav|and let's see if i can get um
data/021349.wav|because you bought in a thousand at peak
data/007140.wav|is like everyone can feel a little bit rest easier when someone starts coughing but after everyone throws their masks off you start
data/021870.wav|find out what actually works change find something maybe other people aren't doing okay i
data/017602.wav|talking about okay the money has gone from here to here because as
data/001104.wav|all the specific oh cause i founded that
data/017876.wav|i mean that's it they they're
data/025250.wav|because i was banned there can be no
data/027323.wav|the game sold millions of copies but most of those millions never beat the game what that creates with
data/010403.wav|walk over their customers and now you get great speeds at a low price in chattanooga
data/026577.wav|it's just two things that could have solved
data/012413.wav|is everybody and it's like yeah yeah now
data/013348.wav|instead you know what it was me i did do the
data/005777.wav|worth about whose view count is bigger and just chatting fine which is fine you know what that's their full-time job that's fine i get up in this conversation to go to the bathroom i'm in the line for the
data/027957.wav|it is it fair to say that this will be the
data/006733.wav|outside of smash events i don't sign
data/008000.wav|i don't think anyone else would would
data/002430.wav|the few months blue arrow at
data/017476.wav|he's like apple companies like activision blizzard is having a strike right now they're i
data/017387.wav|as but this is just mcu
data/018305.wav|the five dude what a great ad boys if you aren't out
data/031419.wav|look at this it's just dominating the
data/020292.wav|it certainly didn't stand out it's exactly what you'd expect very boilerplate very meh this scene i i think they could
data/032087.wav|i think this is when it turns i think
data/024081.wav|he is very serious about it and i respect that one word of advice from the planners when this project wraps up next summer there could be a slight learning curve i hope there's not too much of a learning curve it's it's not that crazy america
data/024668.wav|it's a bit of a snowball effect where soon
data/006055.wav|if you want to play offline smite
data/025648.wav|something's evil about it this might be the most evil like in one headline since like world war
data/024523.wav|we power here but success is not a crime and so unfortunately the judge was not really keen on enforcing this kind of thing even though the judge seemed to agree in
data/026334.wav|i mean they're like temples they are temples to the brand they have people's attention and they have they have become a great way to get people to finally take the plunge and spend an expensive amount of money on a product it signifies
data/009183.wav|way more invested in that like i don't
data/010083.wav|in up the mess after cooking uh
data/003312.wav|in a recession okay and there's no reason that they would put out this particular
data/002960.wav|talking about that's that's crazy they
data/014718.wav|yeah you got a link i want to watch
data/013459.wav|was married his wife and then begged her for money every single day
data/021457.wav|it's not that many shares if there's only a few shares they trade for a lot if there's a lot of shares they trade
data/018798.wav|the actually be honest with you but at the time the concept of people putting aside
data/021269.wav|if numbers are absolutely fraudulent at this point at this point i've looked at enough of their reports to realize that it makes no sense they're putting
data/004350.wav|what is this what is this
data/007747.wav|ludwig said you were super fast is there
data/028117.wav|would include snoop dogg they were gonna
data/002421.wav|it literally never arrived and in fact i never even received the confirmation
data/010933.wav|these blaster so there's a lot there's a lot
data/029936.wav|up with zane in this era is
data/023016.wav|of course they knew it would get caught the second it went up
data/021359.wav|i really feel that safe in it
data/002837.wav|the court date in february and they wanted it in august the court has responded with a basically a
data/006772.wav|all day and i read that text
data/024232.wav|the power to unite us hang on honey
data/010366.wav|but we should have a good day today i
data/016372.wav|entitled to the money and of course for fraudsters that's an invitation the fraudsters are bold buying luxury cars flights on private jets mansions like this los angeles couple who led a massive 20 million dollar fraud ring
data/016076.wav|you just said it appears to be a recreational fluid that's not a case study
data/005516.wav|about like political stuff really i'm
data/002819.wav|we know about and he's not even getting laid
data/015864.wav|youtube bought other people as well they and they got ecosystems and they're

data/012800.wav|and i was trying to get my name out there so i would only play pantheon twisted
data/003034.wav|i just like a weird definitely weird moment and the thing i
data/019861.wav|and then the matrix you know every
data/005026.wav|ap reply pinned to push crypto like some sort of bot yeah that would be that's good yeah oh what
data/026247.wav|literally today a company that you may know hit
data/008046.wav|is whenever there was a toad on screen everyone would say do the toad voice and i would and it would hurt my
data/020691.wav|of low key under the radar building an audience i
data/025229.wav|diamond in league of legends and no one
data/005653.wav|what the time so let me tell you i i got to hang out there was a
data/006760.wav|taking the stupidest parts of youtube and absolutely roasting it
data/025805.wav|and the responses were unanimous for blizzard this guy worked it both and he
data/011776.wav|you can already tell that i have two
data/027292.wav|is it and you think about that and i'm like okay on surface level that seems fine
data/004026.wav|what's play out of my mind let's play that
data/029294.wav|it's really like that's a nice
data/008287.wav|heating the other meals that i have for it and i'm not going to be keeping the minions overlay
data/002283.wav|as the stories would be crazy you get so
data/031893.wav|i literally walking like to over to her

data/024407.wav|gaming has forever changed hey neighbor are you
data/010385.wav|it's where they made it easy don't watch play the game don't it's such a good game i've already played the witness it's a parody game called the looker okay
data/020593.wav|it's known that in the profession of marketing every man woman and child's dream when they enter this business is to one day earn a monday it's a very
data/004672.wav|has taught us okay so in that sense i have seen it throughout my entire life in another sense no i haven't and
data/019278.wav|exclusive drops you can actually buy one of these in a store this thing and this thing are both selling out doesn't matter if you have great games doesn't
data/003286.wav|where to get into the bottom of it you know finally have real freedom freedom warriors out there trying to figure out what's the cause behind these crazy weather events we've been seeing and he's got a good correlation here i'm i'm somewhat you where to get into the bottom of it you know finally we have real freedom freedom warriors out there trying to figure out what's the cause behind these crazy weather events we've
data/004755.wav|or payments and it was going to be about a 2 billion dollar
data/022457.wav|lot of people that worked on this thing but the
data/017115.wav|i think some new subs welcome to the uh truck
data/006036.wav|as i remember that's how it went and uh
data/023485.wav|a million dollars a year to be the official truck of the nfl that's why you see so many goddamn truck
data/022314.wav|adds that have stuck with me and i think about them when i'm at work number five taco bell's blackout campaign in
data/014133.wav|and most importantly out of all this is twitch realized it so i got a quote
data/028971.wav|was a package from my mother it was full to the brim of gummi bears
data/005598.wav|talk with him he told me that he secretly
data/017014.wav|in the first time watching market money live
data/015856.wav|alex famously said their competition is like everything you spend your time on
data/022158.wav|every year because we see two million ads a year they have to get more that to crank up
data/028875.wav|and then all my friends there were like you should do
data/014079.wav|anyway i tweeted it i don't apologize for it either
data/006447.wav|to try and earn items that i can transfer to other
data/004611.wav|what he probably around 10 p.m
data/029897.wav|you leave early attractive go hang out
data/026329.wav|apple shifted it down here they
data/004271.wav|what if you invent a crypto that just can't go down just like it's part of it like
data/002887.wav|no matter who you are he's the
data/007485.wav|and tapa was sitting near me and he ordered the same thing the original joe
data/002154.wav|i want to make a big splash
data/006792.wav|was like hell yeah let's go and then when i got to lud's house and we were
data/023249.wav|but i found a quick video it's from
data/020223.wav|condoms what if someone's in trouble officer officer
data/013278.wav|which is interesting it's a mixed bag
data/012808.wav|guest who was our worst player on team
data/015022.wav|plays commercial please play this commercial please
data/023596.wav|around it you had a massive oil for that everybody remembers stop paying all these around it you had a massive oil spill that everybody remembers stop paying all
data/016962.wav|these they have zero fees on anything and if there's a fee from like your wells fargo
data/000978.wav|the question is so difficult to answer
data/007550.wav|in the phantom but he says fanta
data/015347.wav|amazon is worth more yes but you cannot buy freelancers do you think you've saved enough for your
data/002232.wav|does anyone think this is actually
data/031781.wav|even since this first one which was only a few months ago the
data/013503.wav|little kinder to ourselves the world be a
data/007317.wav|marth will take eight stocks in this next set and i we get 90 to
data/001179.wav|i think it's worth checking out if if it's in your financial space and you can get
data/030514.wav|like that it was kind of it
data/028313.wav|all of than everyone else twitch was
data/019363.wav|i am going to do this
data/020123.wav|how to connect with their audience fries for your wait i want to see what
data/021194.wav|many years ago is about to become coming back in a massive way because as people are sad and lonely nostalgia marketing rises like crazy nostalgic marketing is a tried and true way to remind you of when times were better when times are scary and sad we've already remade all
data/007692.wav|i mean this is very out of my norm let me tell you
data/000972.wav|well as you know i will let you know i will let you guys
data/028347.wav|it's something the game sucks he gets
data/031861.wav|when good the viewership's still good
data/008678.wav|you know like when you see a movie promoted on twitter and it's got an emoji and it's
data/013723.wav|instead of just banning him they sued him they
data/028378.wav|you're talking to a superior maybe there's somebody higher up

data/013951.wav|one thing that's there's one thing that's
data/000109.wav|we talk a good amount but i didn't know
data/015337.wav|yeah that's the one thing they've been um
data/008808.wav|is the billion if if you know if the banks explode and you can't get the money or whatever
data/026932.wav|she did well it's a super competitive
data/020663.wav|this award is for best esports marketing best esports partnership with a brand and to read this award we've got ourselves a special guest nathan one night stan stands general manager

data/020623.wav|to be reading this award i almost want to get up and floss i almost want to get up and floss but i
data/001849.wav|to truly construct and run that city
data/029471.wav|it didn't work and i just played an hour of cube world which was like
data/022493.wav|and some of the best and the worst ones and we shall include an april
data/002683.wav|there should be a walk away clause if if you're already adding up the money
data/025767.wav|riot games and blizzard entertainment a
data/012184.wav|one that shows the smuggler path is
data/024296.wav|go to the next one this one's for carlton drought which is a beer brand that i haven't really heard of
data/021119.wav|and i'm glad i was you know what it just took a little we had to bridge the gap i'm glad
data/021919.wav|people see the youtube videos and they join the chat or create more reddit
data/028097.wav|billion dollars in value was lost instantly
data/026646.wav|we fall in october november they began the discussions of this bio it's actually a
data/004138.wav|i hired pay the musician as like a
data/028987.wav|and she felt so bad so now for at least a while she would
data/004582.wav|i was gonna say this tomorrow but the truth is
data/003758.wav|i can have to do it because
data/024951.wav|i thought i would never play this game let alone
data/022896.wav|time protect iphone users from viruses malware privacy attacks etc this is no easy task basically the core of
data/020019.wav|to look at um paypal was acquired by
data/025308.wav|give out some fails oh yeah
data/004360.wav|i just want to sit in this for a second
data/013922.wav|our shopping app it's blowing up
data/031542.wav|it's happening no the other guy does not know
data/018868.wav|there's memes there's a bunch of memes okay let's see sprite cranberry memes
data/006488.wav|and the data is not looking good okay
data/010133.wav|cats okay things are different now okay
data/001280.wav|when i watched him he would be like hey eat this bowl penis for fifty thousand
data/029881.wav|i i'm going to all these tournaments
data/018799.wav|the the happiness in a way that it does not deserve it's just sugar water
data/023010.wav|so what they did to kick this whole thing off
data/005501.wav|six beers deep then i could go i could
data/030964.wav|okay with that that's a really good idea
data/024885.wav|and you run out of moves or
data/001129.wav|the my history because i was looking at one
data/028597.wav|at the beginning of the season but i stabilized at around
data/016622.wav|but again there are opportunities and there are bad parts that is of course the rise in the global average surface temperature
data/018071.wav|this game was a notorious flop
data/001703.wav|worried about i was worried you would go in this
data/018554.wav|weapon they have is game pass sony's trying to make
data/011962.wav|when you start to get like jobs
data/017037.wav|in general i've had many good experiences with work but on the
data/030617.wav|and i was playing pokemon and it was warm and it was awesome and i would play outside and then we moved to germany and i got out of the plane and it was frigid winter
data/031034.wav|out of that place they all cleared up it was
data/013286.wav|we got some good ones i know i started a little late but if you're here
data/017295.wav|thank you for introducing us into the wonders
data/010637.wav|what i didn't because i will not be cursing today i actually made
data/031815.wav|in the world and it's small and
data/008997.wav|more than they used to i'm watching you guys i'm seeing a swift uptick in i can't it's not quite little w's level yet but
data/019039.wav|and said don't ruin the immersion
data/017882.wav|do you think one part of the
data/016017.wav|no one will give you money people are afraid
data/012604.wav|but anyway that you know what i'll tell
data/005159.wav|what a real estate and i asked her to confirm that many many times as you might see in the video i asked her to confirm it many many many many many times
data/005687.wav|carl jacobs was playing fall guys with him
data/022762.wav|basically six times twitch i think at the math they literally could have like they could have given people a thousand
data/022026.wav|and social it's like property of the public so you really have to you have to err sometimes on being a
data/001379.wav|hold up to be the first contestant on a brand new hilarious game show okay and all
data/018695.wav|if the company has a responsibility to all its shareholders to tell them how it's going to grow to a two trillion dollar company how's it going to get bigger even if microsoft
data/022845.wav|and both companies have been worse ever since that's the end of the story except for one thing but this guy scott ahrens said together
data/004227.wav|that would have been a big message
data/024905.wav|do you feel like you earned is is a very strong
data/015213.wav|we globally with two languages peacock
data/023092.wav|as i wanna talk about people taste tested these two wines okay

data/025783.wav|as the entire time we're just not gonna
data/015616.wav|i'm talking of course about the mighty peacock
data/010155.wav|or to your dad today he's
data/022286.wav|you spend so much money and you
data/006977.wav|i sincerely heard about but my number is in that range and it's never been like that ever in my life the thing about streaming is that
data/016181.wav|interesting smart forward thinking forward thinking i like that you know you
data/013986.wav|and realize that they're not really
data/016718.wav|from home uh sort of quote unquote revolution
data/032111.wav|and he goes oh i get
data/030783.wav|i mean when you wrote i know i said i was top
data/001882.wav|title because it feels way too
data/028286.wav|which is where you can see chad on vods
data/023164.wav|they're fake yeah they're not really from a grill they just adam it's just
data/008638.wav|actually they're going to do it but we'll see
data/026829.wav|talking about ever that goes through uh
data/024863.wav|i have to give them content yuck
data/005485.wav|i find out later my father put her up to it i'm getting
data/004997.wav|to a free billion dollars cash can help i mean it's not a bad thing it's a quick cash infusion it's probably about as much
data/019148.wav|maybe he's just got it like that and so maybe it's a right call on Sony's part
data/005725.wav|he was carrying out some art
data/008216.wav|is that i disagree with and they are just bad at
data/030531.wav|we're staying with us for two nights before we leave and i i literally i'm not kidding you i found
data/024933.wav|in the game oh no oh no and that's that's an audience of game developers listening to a game
data/004373.wav|stuff on twitter all the time because i like all of them
data/025423.wav|it's throwing down the basketball and like shaking his opponent's hand
data/016728.wav|to make a kilogram of cell-based shrimp you can now make that for
data/009492.wav|that's something that can just be
data/009608.wav|and score and then just walk into their base and be like try to kill me try to kill me so you can cause them to
data/000556.wav|there are expensive they're expensive watches
data/007436.wav|well you probably would have worn that a little sigma tank
data/030607.wav|we can warn ethiopia about covid we can
data/031176.wav|time and also because i think fortnite
data/031960.wav|so the audio does not pick up the crowd that well i was there the crowd was loud when i watched the
data/007893.wav|anyway that was funny uh thank you for
data/014779.wav|it'll it'll pop up everything you spend money on and you can swipe it to personal or business which makes it much much much easier
data/001838.wav|keep up the work king keep up the work you didn't say good work i noticed
data/015705.wav|it was very clean simple intuitive interface and i found i quite like them so far and
data/017167.wav|but before we jump to that i need you guys to do what i love that you do and that is
data/031454.wav|directly into the water well over his
data/026249.wav|when it had a standing army and owned india but
data/000839.wav|and i was like but what what did what prompts that how do you go from
data/028895.wav|student events how did you not vomit oh i
data/020511.wav|the same hype are are much smaller and after months of crunch all their actions leading up to the launch instead of seeming mysterious or being explainable away all seem more negative in hindsight cyber punk twenty seventy seven runs surprisingly well on current gen consoles the same hype are are much smaller and after months of crunch all of their actions leading up to the launch instead of seeming mysterious or being explainable away all seem more negative in hindsight cyberpunk 2077
data/012816.wav|and because of that we got invited to play in vegas for
data/010589.wav|the world's in chaos this country is
data/011738.wav|because it says their name it'll say like it'll say like um you know mark and then
data/000517.wav|like the the the bachelor party what
data/009216.wav|rts multiplayer is terrible for new players because it's very hard it's very difficult and there's nobody to blame but yourself when you lose so it's kind of like
data/014038.wav|but they have a generally good positive feeling of ludwig and the thing that youtube gaming needs most is legitimacy
data/001164.wav|the to make meal that's not gonna be
data/031327.wav|with the full charges like theft so i have to go to the police station like they the police officers
data/020326.wav|one and ludwig obviously is a commanding
data/003600.wav|i live in the bay right now i'm a cs major but it's tough getting interviews
data/007291.wav|and it'll make sense because that child owed me money okay i was farming a child for money and then flipping them off so you
data/008736.wav|if he can prove that then they've got
data/020011.wav|i was in revenue a year is crazy so
data/020910.wav|no i don't it's luck this is still luck i wasn't a genius it says people g pick a random stock
data/014576.wav|that's a world where no one's getting paid as donald trump said competition breeds excellence yeah you definitely want competition bro
data/006325.wav|the for me to not take the moral high ground in any way but actually
data/025084.wav|what just people that actually use the products right so it's not social media
data/024256.wav|you know you take the red key yeah can
data/018966.wav|i can't look anywhere else nothing can distract me that's too
data/018622.wav|with the and anyone else other than maybe disney on making their own content their own
data/022005.wav|the kitchen and then twist it
data/030184.wav|racing these we're racing through these
data/031809.wav|i being right here in ludwig's orbit to being pretty much in ludwig's orbit but also more in charlie's orbit i'm pretty much
data/005444.wav|you're so lucky dude this guy probably
data/001024.wav|one my bad man it's not you're not
data/001910.wav|i have legitimately never thought about that is that including the one dollar quack takes oh i forgot that i have to pay my
data/003201.wav|it's good this is a good thing yes this is good this is a good thing yes
data/021851.wav|i have ever seen in my life like a super villain so something about long-term paid off
data/017202.wav|it's not as severe i've heard like hospitalization but it's like it's just it it sucks like the worst flu you ever had
data/000098.wav|if the two months hey big i love this stream so
data/016145.wav|don't make your life decisions based off of i'm
data/022228.wav|fuck are we doing out here why
data/031094.wav|if the hang out stans would
data/026140.wav|okay what i want is i mean this could
data/011466.wav|i do love hipping and hopping
data/031661.wav|one hundred thousand dollar cash prize in the title of league of legends world champions the season one circuit is comprised
data/027585.wav|i think we covered the main
data/002705.wav|now well over six rolls we are not well over six
data/015169.wav|for this show it's been viewed over
data/006442.wav|i can't believe he just verbatim described
data/014901.wav|it's just like them suing a random
data/016703.wav|to trends are becoming massive one is remote work among corporations that can afford it because they don't
data/020501.wav|was spotify in a bidding war for the house and he bought it okay and he's living he's living march and he's like dude he's like dude i would literally give all this up and was spotify in a bidding war for the house and he bought it okay and he's living he's living large and he's like dude he's like dude i would literally give
data/000804.wav|i was like you know what i'm not gonna really
data/029346.wav|we're talking to each other and then we get to the end and we have to go to dinner and uh and
data/030758.wav|this let me show you right here no text no text at all i went to
data/003983.wav|the bald no he wasn't bald bros
data/007196.wav|that's what i said and he said he said awesome thank you so much
data/001173.wav|i feel like about factor is that it's
data/023293.wav|the drink water and immediately coke stock price
data/019709.wav|yeah dude unless you hire unless you at
data/013444.wav|star wars is so broad and
data/026208.wav|the two different ipod shuffles and then i have to plug my headphones into those and so
data/016167.wav|the the guy i'm actually a little bit
data/013842.wav|if you get it out on position
data/010324.wav|at the bottom great suggestions and i knew that what i post
data/028789.wav|could eternity and she goes no seriously what
data/001394.wav|i said what i said he just repeated the
data/017937.wav|three players don't care spend no money on
data/028430.wav|why bars were fire don't worry about that my bars were fire don't worry about that
data/020010.wav|much money and to make 10 billion dollars in
data/001631.wav|oh new maps to conquer that's that's the opposite of the the videos purpose because there is a new map the one thing i want you to know
data/008882.wav|did he impregnated a twitter exec oh my god i
data/012051.wav|is the worst part oh oh wait
data/001881.wav|at myself as sort of not a visionary but the visionary a god if you no i don't
data/022172.wav|why guarantee it's a sad one brace yourself
data/012959.wav|if you're doing it and you're liking it
data/000592.wav|as but still we all do we all do edibles we all go into
data/026472.wav|about it whether or not they upgrade their their
data/031702.wav|instantly know every anime in the world tough is
data/013023.wav|yeah there's a bunch of classes about
data/019633.wav|hello hello hey is this delroy yes sir
data/012121.wav|for you to always win because it's part of the larger story but when you do them it happens in the rest of the game for everybody else so like when we
data/019332.wav|these market which is like high-end
data/015393.wav|this was the big innovation okay and it has been actually quite successful quite successful because
data/002695.wav|you certainly are brave and bold for never walking away from a game that prints you free money with no downside a hero just like john baptiste
data/003573.wav|i'm a realist things are bad i don't think
data/013954.wav|cut you off at the bar if you're getting pissed drunk and
data/000781.wav|how did i lose all that extra money because
data/000551.wav|the story i remembered the four times and i was like thinking man this that would be
data/030137.wav|more annoyed if i wasn't playing it because of how much of a stink i made
data/030404.wav|and so he's like as he's
data/013943.wav|every month it's the exact same with buy not
data/029503.wav|but it would have been so cool
data/030461.wav|you know stand up i had gotten a minute this is a little extreme you know that fall this but as why did i got you know stand out i had gotten a i mean this is a little extreme you know
data/021720.wav|so i'm gonna put this in c for cringe next one is
data/012982.wav|where nobody can learn anything like it's like i
data/002320.wav|my nose i did not put that on right right
data/007742.wav|i smugly presumably at a nicer restaurant wearing a
data/031788.wav|insular they did not connect to the main world there's small crossover with the
data/006321.wav|i dug up a bunch of private info on him
data/018636.wav|they flopped hard so that that was a weakness in their armor because the most popular games of tomorrow are still going to be determined by influencers on twitch and youtube that's gotten more and more important and microsoft doesn't own them and can
data/031061.wav|what he was like kind of
data/030505.wav|i swear to god i'm almost about to
data/023043.wav|this is illegal this is a monopoly
data/030393.wav|i'm like look at him in the eyes i'm like dead serious i'm like sir there is a ring
data/026141.wav|could also be a dangerous precedent but i'm going to give him a dub for this
data/024821.wav|that's how you can keep people in there they have lots of things to do to to stuff to upgrade to progress along and that's how you can
data/010991.wav|it sure you are the group to our minions
data/001812.wav|i didn't want my co-workers to think
data/027348.wav|more widespread phenomenon and and it's it's it's not just
data/020033.wav|two billion and that's why zuck like fears google zuckerberg is trying to own vr because
data/032369.wav|music play the same thing over and over for a grinder hall of gods is significantly easier because you don't need a long set of focus you can just
data/030845.wav|what do you think from my stream they would know you from for
data/025222.wav|and i want to see some crunch okay
data/012747.wav|it was worth it we all instantly
data/002919.wav|blowing up expectations now it's going to be a few days before
data/003763.wav|if the worst but in a district where they can get voted out which is still a lot of districts
data/018577.wav|because once you get locked into a subscription service you don't want to leave it once once you're on netflix for example you're hooked for life people are netflix forever they don't they don't leave once you're once you have your cloud gaming service that has all of your games forever you don't want to leave it it's like steam dude nobody wants to leave steam it could be
data/004124.wav|if the share something on social media
data/011979.wav|they want to be good guys like the vast majority of the ship is like obviously they're booing this guy and they want to be
data/024549.wav|one line that one line the
data/026781.wav|because if you're trying to get like a top engineer or something you can give them a stock package that they're happy
data/008793.wav|i mean there is a world where he is ordered to pay x amount of billion to twitter says no
data/013335.wav|it's a story of waste i had this idea for marketing monday that involved i can't explain why because i might still do a
data/002482.wav|make your bags bigger so they take up more space in the aisle i don't think
data/003076.wav|you know and nobody everyone like enjoyed them but because they hadn't happened yet everyone was
data/001742.wav|helps somebody on the deck or
data/023027.wav|it'll be like look who knows what could happen who knows
data/002830.wav|it's a state of being in limbo and
data/021974.wav|that it's harder to be kind than to be
data/023094.wav|light airy hints of passion fruit banana
data/015176.wav|netflix realized that as they grow and more people show up to be competition all of their competitors disney
data/008233.wav|in this situation i think it's i think it's terrible
data/016888.wav|every single person got on twit you
data/022338.wav|and one cool thing about this campaign you know if you're if you're wondering what's going on and a brand tells you
data/001233.wav|maybe i mentioned the pancakes and they
data/031461.wav|yeah hanging out with lud he's being a pretty inattentive dog friend
data/014102.wav|i have a problem with um tabs
data/010179.wav|but please don't let twitch see
data/019377.wav|other teams started trying to to learn
data/016700.wav|we'll go back to work it is this trend
data/028087.wav|at design he tries to use it
data/021601.wav|it made more money driving their stock up
data/012859.wav|of my grades which i sort
data/011351.wav|in the quote to include like
data/028825.wav|the city you go live in your
data/000942.wav|how about i don't legally change it but no matter what i do people still call me
data/032309.wav|will be the next challenge and so i i had this whole plan where i was like i even set it up with the way i asked
data/028249.wav|it's pretty good what we do behind the scenes
data/029024.wav|story real quick because i don't think
data/014349.wav|be a lot bigger they need to grow broader to have people
data/016213.wav|i know that i talk about marketing you don't have to tell me
data/024292.wav|is to associate itself with that element of sophistication of class of worldliness i think they picked the right actors for it i think
data/012234.wav|i again it's incredibly rare we have the exact
data/002498.wav|and the main quests are pretty dumb but there's a side quest in deus ex
data/032405.wav|it's so much harder and then this is the system
data/007922.wav|profile picture so it's fine looks like you used your
data/021665.wav|they went bigger they did a million dollars and they said
data/018231.wav|yeah i want to talk about um
data/024629.wav|it's forward less than three months maybe i think a
data/025724.wav|it's to make a bite-sized horror
data/025909.wav|the blitz chunk situation happened this
data/023560.wav|the for a belt because for you the perceived
data/006097.wav|if you ever lose a game five set
data/014788.wav|like clean easy news app that kind of
data/011117.wav|oh no lie i kind of was like
data/032236.wav|he places it on the field and it's gone all within the span of like a minute and a half that's like they robbed him if they had a gun they couldn't get it faster and i realized wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait are we the
data/001202.wav|well every day as an adult also the thing about lunchables is i when i was a kid i really liked lunchables until one day i had a piece of ham that was so slimy that even as a just like a
data/014600.wav|so no i wouldn't consider it it would be a bad
data/014581.wav|with the streaming war is it better for google to back out to avoid losing face if they lose to twitch
data/003278.wav|it's very very hot in spain right now so you can't blame them okay and that's good news somehow it's incredibly hot in spain
data/021928.wav|find this wheel to get it started but once it
data/012187.wav|or like ooh well the thing is we do have one more
data/010632.wav|the show you but you know i should
data/019873.wav|so whenever you launch a new
data/011245.wav|i say we got an extra room you can you
data/013969.wav|don't offer what they promised you
data/002988.wav|at the theater and we hear yelling we hear like
data/021913.wav|it picks up speed this is an example for my stream if you make a funny twitch segment it's usually better
data/006805.wav|he was on a hot streak and i was
data/026245.wav|well then they would have because it just feels like you get none of the pain your brain is like wait no pain all gain at the moment i click
data/009190.wav|to all the editors and unfortunately quack but
data/008806.wav|check out just pay a billion dollars that's what i thought it's not it's not that
data/027587.wav|long time with no real progress elon musk is offering to pay way more than it's worth they decided to take it that's the long and short of it and now we have to figure out where it's going and it's gonna become very political very quickly so there was this note that said trump said he has no plans to rejoin twitter even if
data/021822.wav|what are his secrets and how
data/001427.wav|i saying that right yeah close enough okay cool
data/020181.wav|i would rather drink your social media person's piss
data/027228.wav|isn't entirely different itch so what
data/024236.wav|maybe the stephen hawking voice was he alive
data/020558.wav|i think that's fair to say now i took no man's sky down because it got fixed if this game gets fixed i'll take it down but right now at launch based on what they said for eight years and what we got especially console players it's the most
data/031111.wav|erin better at streaming he got good at bits he got funnier
data/026242.wav|it's been proven to almost double checkout
data/025325.wav|warlocks siphon life spell this is a
data/017629.wav|would be on someone else's terms it would be
data/024792.wav|much more likely to not share their losses and happily share their wins youtubers
data/026230.wav|india of those the payments you make are far
data/001639.wav|what videos and it'll fix it but um
data/011712.wav|well let me see if i have the video uh
data/005517.wav|i was just it was like i don't even i can't even think of
data/028582.wav|we just took the money he made me and i'll take that dude that's super
data/015865.wav|they're trying to get more groups of people so friends that
data/030105.wav|i was like i'm going to be
data/025975.wav|this presentation with this a website that went up on riot games
data/006189.wav|please don't cry as long as you have the
data/031800.wav|we crushing it and so between
data/014742.wav|like to begin with the traditional
data/003065.wav|at this all right enough about this uh
data/030068.wav|hey you pikachu is coming out and things are going to change around here okay things are this is going to be my life now
data/018226.wav|it's already popular to make their own
data/008739.wav|as sorry and twitter forgives him
data/021603.wav|i go a little bit bigger for these tom
data/017498.wav|you know and i thought i'd
data/016361.wav|of america over the last two years the federal government approved a historic
data/012397.wav|it was cool because we were like in bed or it was like near night and the alarms
data/003979.wav|have we ever had an entirely bald
data/029951.wav|no no no no no no no no no no no no no i'm serious
data/016089.wav|what are you talking about has a timer that counts down
data/017138.wav|it's definitely a talk on apple
data/028564.wav|walk through it and it turns out like if you don't fill out the form that says what price you got the stock at where you got it from and how much it gained over the course you got it then then it just gets counted as the
data/020298.wav|if the parents it should be like the snowman doing this
data/027277.wav|it'd be elden ring which has sort of branched
data/019421.wav|came back from the dead and is black is that what you think is and i got him for my show in the name of the company business i always talk about this this is not even a this is not even a jingle thing you need to have your name front and center people forget so much of what they see in a commercial
data/005274.wav|it's friends start loudly talking about like
data/010897.wav|we get everything ready let me get everything
data/004269.wav|they go up but not down
data/001713.wav|why this totally unrelated but if you guys
data/001326.wav|it's impressive but it's not like i
data/025481.wav|main goal is not winning esports tournaments acquiring them
data/008969.wav|basically the only argument that i've seen that
data/015585.wav|if they they raised about two billion dollars to make
data/001505.wav|very tasty smoothies very tasty meals healthy
data/011453.wav|if not worse you can relate there might be a common ground here i just read an interesting article about
data/018190.wav|plurality around three to five yeah this is a good range i would have given
data/023326.wav|now i mean obviously there is one coin that only just prints value and that of course is
data/011688.wav|on the flight and in the car right there is
data/009508.wav|to sort of simplify my decisions oh no
data/024005.wav|and they're not that smart to be nine head planning this okay the truth
data/029496.wav|just like the end of the dog is gonna
data/007800.wav|whereas on me and then i go
data/016923.wav|who cares that the cost has gone up a
data/007952.wav|yeah smiley face i am and then
data/000569.wav|this point so i'm not sure i fully understand it but
data/031653.wav|it reaches out and helps me hold it king
data/025365.wav|and who else are you gonna
data/025994.wav|which is all about like binge drinking in january to start the new year off right
data/020160.wav|the numb to everything anxious and depressed about everything and vitriolic or closed off towards anyone different from them young people today have it the best and the worst they go to obscure
data/010778.wav|sign up for the private military for six months of free prime now amber herd's lawyer falls to her knees
data/027276.wav|it's what allowed them to really stand out from the pack for
data/012230.wav|all in and he shoves his chips all
data/021536.wav|in a lot of people who don't have the money getting hurt of that's why i'm i'm i'm ambivalent we don't talk about is that there's there's other in a lot of people who don't have the money getting hurt so that's why i'm i'm i'm uh ambivalent
data/027565.wav|well and that elon must take over would
data/012017.wav|and so we started to get like at the beginning all the missions we got and the things we got were kind of sent
data/006787.wav|as you saw in that clip at the beginning
data/028482.wav|is like you are not taking responsibility
data/023789.wav|every single time i do my boot
data/019473.wav|you know what is not a generational thing array of we could all you know what it's not a generational thing all right we can all come together
data/004400.wav|kind of weird that there's no like atrial branding on it though you know since we're basically co-sponsors of
data/017340.wav|i would give it a fail because uh a
data/026038.wav|like they're about to go to war there is nothing similar to what it is it's like a draft yeah
data/026840.wav|and it was a very celebrity focused and a very crypto focused super bowl now
data/011807.wav|and they're every single window is a
data/014973.wav|the party for a long time it was only netflix then it was netflix and hulu then it was netflix hulu and amazon then disney plus now as of this year i think that everyone that's going to arrive has arrived there is no future streaming services coming peacock and paramount were the last of the party
data/008774.wav|right here so this is uh this is a guy
data/008620.wav|and and then just go on with his life
data/028104.wav|it's really it's uh it's a no-win situation
data/024738.wav|costs sixty dollars this person bought i
data/014279.wav|and so that that carries much more weight than just grabbing one off ninja
data/026695.wav|how bobby kodak finds these deals
data/028902.wav|oh and everything's kind of cramped
data/032142.wav|walk you through it i'll walk you through it a little bit near midnight i land in vegas and immediately i've got a hankering for gambling the second i land i withdraw
data/020656.wav|greater in the ad i'm talking of course about
data/022535.wav|you're able to work at google and to want to work at google right so
data/009843.wav|if the feasible i'll tell you what the best
data/026641.wav|what industry and they're using that that muscle they get from owning one industry and they're using that that
data/026547.wav|more recently and he created a game called verbatim
data/002687.wav|i don't mind let's say 50.
data/000112.wav|it's really nice stuff and he's coming so that's cool
data/014194.wav|so total hours watched i think this number
data/018986.wav|was they didn't fundamentally understand how the phone attention span thing works they didn't understand about the second
data/028671.wav|at college frat i swear to god the earliest
data/001958.wav|pretty happy overall it's all good i just wish i had a little more time
data/014430.wav|important it's it's it's starting to infiltrate normie culture it's starting
data/010581.wav|you can actually open doors right you can go in and out of doors no problem there's no there's nothing stopping you
data/021403.wav|this is going to go down that if we start to make it go up even a
data/019476.wav|impactful ads and both times people listened as
data/028381.wav|bandwidth right now maybe if we could reallocate
data/025580.wav|and favorite arizona sunshine i love arizona sunshine that game basically got me and
data/003548.wav|what i've noticed from streaming i've noticed the the number of people who find dumerism to be more of like a
data/025714.wav|i think any marketing where it's like giving
data/027876.wav|at reasonable levels as real investments like a more
data/025949.wav|for your team to be featured next to
data/012452.wav|so i asked the dude i was like hey i was like buddy if i'm helping you out and i'm gonna get
data/024567.wav|what they'll do that but they're within their rights to still do that so literally the
data/032165.wav|you'll never come back for that second attack
data/011460.wav|in good god damn album and
data/003782.wav|and of course every republican votes no on it because their entire goal is to make sure biden gets zero wins at all
data/010352.wav|sounds like my first grade birthday
data/014487.wav|get fooled by a sales pitch so anyway we'll see so
data/017821.wav|just because i it's my work and i get into it but if you think about it look at this look at this look at
data/024332.wav|the tagline the tagline for this or the
data/019484.wav|people are actually able to skip over
data/020852.wav|as a little bit worried when i saw that i was
data/030714.wav|yeah everyone knows that i feel like that's i
data/001738.wav|hey the weather clears up dramatically and they're making great time and he starts to get really nervous he's like oh no i'm going to lose i'm going to lose everything i'm going to lose my last bit of money and i have to go home and tell
data/028510.wav|but i did try and i did sell you know one
data/031643.wav|you decide okay i can't say that i also remember the one thing that got again i was super nervous here again as
data/026659.wav|i get your free stock check it out now let me give you a story from my past that sort of explains what i think happened here
data/030192.wav|well the other one would grab the person's leg and drag them down
data/022017.wav|in the double down they said why would we
data/004036.wav|by the way i i've recorded it so it should
data/020101.wav|and you're buying the company just to get the people and so what they did was apple spent
data/024389.wav|we theaters with the movie bridget jones the edge of reason like a pixar intro they put this
data/012832.wav|what's going on he's like don't worry don't
data/001098.wav|if they don't play league that if that's the
data/020119.wav|make you smarter but it is interesting
data/018200.wav|secondly it has one simple thing they won car of the year everyone
data/019727.wav|you don't take out this job if you can't get this or don't do this
data/019045.wav|stop meeting technically even if i wasn't human it
data/018873.wav|the dog commercials get ready to write this
data/004574.wav|thus saving myself a decent amount of cash as we're
data/019296.wav|i i have enough people here that i want to show you guys something i wanted i want to show you guys something it's proof that i'm the greatest marketer of all time oh i remembered this i was
data/021192.wav|we're going to see full force nostalgia marketing for things that were popular to this group of millennials final
data/031780.wav|very first twitch atlas i pretty much decided i wasn't going to react to this again but the new one i looked at today is actually quite interesting and it shows how much
data/031729.wav|we're gonna look at dewey's page first and then i'm gonna learn about actually sorry uh before i even go on
data/010462.wav|is probably five separate streams across you know a little bit of time
data/016595.wav|big tech clients big big corporate clients
data/006828.wav|you get cool upgrade paths every time
data/011704.wav|disneyland in orlando and the uber driver would not drive us there and she didn't speak english she was like no staff entrance so we're like
data/015726.wav|what do you have a general idea of like how the streaming services differ what their strengths and
data/007035.wav|and i wouldn't even had one to play with if i didn't have that so
data/021753.wav|showing up on my turf telling me that they got the sandwich of all sandwiches but i got loyalty
data/031193.wav|isn't that crazy twitch started with
data/026708.wav|makes perfect sense why they were behind him because he was orchestrating a deal to get them out of all of these problems and dump it in microsoft's lap and so today
data/010626.wav|he pulled me into a call alone and we sat there for three four hours and he walked me through everything in smite like like not even playing the game like opened up the
data/018540.wav|all the ad stuff amazon is trying to
data/027771.wav|said Twitter's board has no choice but
data/008632.wav|using two dollars a day it helps you for a bit but unless you change the business structurally it's not you
data/007693.wav|any chance you speak spanish i'm mexican
data/000824.wav|other stories from that and tell you but again i i am i am
data/030339.wav|it's a real nato badge like from my dad was flying in nato
data/018476.wav|it's himself watched my last marketing monday
data/015302.wav|i wanted to say i own the place now
data/020859.wav|i also know for a fact that almost nothing that i learned in college has been useful in my real life so that's that what i do say
data/007809.wav|then i have a marketing monday that's like pretty ready enough ready that i think i could do it today or ipso facto we
data/003007.wav|and you still hear commotion from
data/025822.wav|that my friend jimmy wong had to tweet a
data/003191.wav|try and survive the coming storm so we will see what's happening over

data/028579.wav|begging for my help day of and
data/021442.wav|if you are betting this money because it is the one chance you get sometimes
data/008787.wav|for a company he doesn't want to buy
data/017849.wav|you know that kind of thing is is what
data/027740.wav|if that didn't make me love
data/010704.wav|why this whole store if you can balance it on a balance beam
data/031978.wav|if the for a video editor who kind of got our sense of humor
data/002600.wav|that's morbius i i do be getting heads
