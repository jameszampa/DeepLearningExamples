mels/006345.pt|it's time for the first time in over a month to get back to a little marketing on this channel a little bit of business news a little bit of what's going on in the world but of course before we do that i'm
mels/006948.pt|now i have to like now i gotta take charge of my life
mels/003020.pt|in a theater there i could
mels/016759.pt|the economy it basically reduces the number of business founded raises the number of

mels/012651.pt|what do you remember from the shark cruiser that was fun she went to
mels/026698.pt|they lose all of the viewers of course because it's on youtube now it goes down like

mels/004959.pt|and just go back to being rich
mels/003388.pt|i don't want to see the robots come for him though it would be cool if we
mels/006767.pt|let's gang up on that damn luca and
mels/001349.pt|fact she already said yes that's sort of what the marriage is is uh bringing to life
mels/022197.pt|if a run to the edge and they wrote it to the edge and they
mels/006380.pt|bowl game or like you know don't hate me but i actually like the game it's got people
mels/024901.pt|what is under time pressure next thing is the ikea effect okay the ikea effect states we love things more if we felt like we were part of the creation if we felt involved in making them we think it's worth a lot more than it is so even a shitty table from ikea generally has
mels/012453.pt|in character here uh like what
mels/004053.pt|if you do is be ever vigilant
mels/016701.pt|it has continued um people used to live a lot closer to
mels/026064.pt|the industry every ticket sold one out of every
mels/029772.pt|if you win crew every one of the winning crew gets a shot and you take it during the ceremony and
mels/023219.pt|but apparently it makes consumers think it's safer they'll just put like that's like saying exists you're increasing the
mels/002792.pt|if you go to their music video all the
mels/017460.pt|at the great success despite kellogg's going through
mels/021405.pt|in the short that means you have sold stock that you
mels/030986.pt|bad but it was rent control that's all i could afford so i i would not leave it even when the
mels/002353.pt|the what i'm saying i don't feel like you're
mels/010447.pt|fewer that doesn't make any sense right we can all agree that doesn't make any sense stupid thing to say
mels/028759.pt|with the opportunity i said yes yes she was like
mels/023578.pt|was tickets from the movie theater and giving them to you it was an amazing deal and that's why they were able to attract a ton of customers in no time they did they did almost no marketing but of course that
mels/029153.pt|i love this game i love pokemon i'm happy to do it again i do it again i get to about
mels/020183.pt|and this is such a powerful mental image
mels/015329.pt|game of thrones final season on
mels/006057.pt|a lot of stories to tell
mels/030845.pt|what do you think from my stream they would know you from for
mels/003350.pt|in overdue bills people not paying their bills and
mels/005060.pt|in the past three months he's been a bit
mels/031069.pt|it's a match bets within like an hour of first meeting
mels/018816.pt|it's crazy and they chose the hooters outfit
mels/013950.pt|it's a big problem and so i just want to make sure that this branding does not fool you
mels/005177.pt|it was really ride or die team green and so every moment that i stayed in there getting a
mels/009080.pt|i don't think you needed to close with that but i am happy that the
mels/023585.pt|i think subject i know it's a little it's actually one of my most intense marketing streams not too many jokes but i uh i i
mels/016314.pt|literally to the bone and you just have to give
mels/001482.pt|the somebody up i'm pulling up atomic bsk
mels/027236.pt|come from developers it reads like sour grapes it reads like not understanding that there may be something distinct here that is refreshing to gamers that
mels/009637.pt|or something and they all chase and then
mels/008187.pt|and i got i got a pretty heavy gaming
mels/004034.pt|i was sick after i beat eldon ring i played a
mels/012541.pt|i killed the droid she would tap it and it
mels/008362.pt|unfortunately it's not greed it's way
mels/007889.pt|random equals funny i feel like everything he writes is so important it's scarcity
mels/028335.pt|is now it's game three and the air in the room has changed because first of all
mels/019854.pt|in that area and be just a huge success we're now in the top five the top five most
mels/010311.pt|i think it'd be harder to get tarik than
mels/022732.pt|or loss now they only paid 7 billion
mels/003794.pt|at the time anyway but i'll be i'll be live in
mels/007958.pt|we're going to do today so i have a marketing monday
mels/020415.pt|as the campbell's chicken soup bad
mels/012271.pt|well dice and it's kind of legit all right
mels/006043.pt|they can say it all the time he abuses
mels/022348.pt|it's like and this my friends is what it smells like hi there i'm
mels/026200.pt|boring preamble to what will probably be a good movie the second dude will be fire the first
mels/001120.pt|now you can't grind nearly as hard fuchsia unfortunately your obligations to friends and your life means you cannot be a complete and total
mels/004150.pt|we need you to send us
mels/021125.pt|like this is not the behind the
mels/004935.pt|as obligated to pay the only way that
mels/028745.pt|by the way he never ever made it out of
mels/011898.pt|do it and for a penny and
mels/031453.pt|at which point when i got the ball back i immediately
mels/024487.pt|to announce that both have lost it somehow managed to be a result that they both are unhappy with big win for everyone
mels/006573.pt|where it made an average of
mels/019642.pt|want to know where this came from or what
mels/001602.pt|to be quite convenient and good uh legitimate thing for most people i
mels/030764.pt|you know cause that's the rules
mels/025106.pt|we're cable companies in general are universally hated almost everyone that has to regularly use a cable company
mels/020762.pt|so many hearts will get crushed so many people's lives have been worked to the bone to try and win this award but only one man or woman did it with the poise and grace and tact necessary to be this marketing monday's man of the year that's why the award goes to travis scott travis scott is the
mels/006197.pt|at the beginning but his mom didn't sound
mels/023277.pt|look at the label and she
mels/025470.pt|mean actual win this week not because of
mels/002953.pt|huh but it doesn't feel like it's entered the cultural consciousness for all that money
mels/025911.pt|is literally hid from the camera and they were all fired including the casters which was absolutely ludicrous extreme extreme
mels/019358.pt|jason i don't want to just be
mels/030833.pt|or watch this stream which one
mels/005018.pt|you guys with subscribers and i purchase twitter on the dip okay i'll do a handshake deal with
mels/012542.pt|and it would just go static
mels/002926.pt|it was perfect background noise tv but it's not it's just not
mels/019722.pt|astronomically crazy and the product they're offering
mels/017117.pt|yo a truck my family started calling me
mels/010850.pt|the thought involved you me you me
mels/030498.pt|what the places or or did stuff or things cheated funny or
mels/002537.pt|for to respond i don't know
mels/017603.pt|you can't do all of the things as well as everybody you can't put all your money in everything you have to
mels/027594.pt|because he said i hope elon
mels/022045.pt|that's my thought that's my take but that means it's a very hot week for
mels/005618.pt|get it because we're way past it and let me
mels/008022.pt|and i'm just i'm just really
mels/004288.pt|with the game playing and it's all coming out of
mels/032309.pt|will be the next challenge and so i i had this whole plan where i was like i even set it up with the way i asked
mels/015900.pt|or disney or netflix could merge okay i just don't think or disney or netflix could merge okay i just don't think i don't think it would happen i think it would give them too much market power and it would be
mels/029703.pt|we're a little bit and he beats my ass like like i've nev like
mels/008813.pt|his own dollars to get nothing to slightly hurt twitter
mels/007371.pt|did you see that and then we were like
mels/017654.pt|is that they're worth the price tag
mels/012987.pt|we're like actually learning history all the time and then you learn something else all the time and then
mels/021965.pt|what can get an amazing combo video
mels/002631.pt|now if he gets it again not only will i go to a hundred
mels/009714.pt|what if i give you a counteroffer i don't play it man i do exactly what i plan
mels/009652.pt|it's probably a bad example but it
mels/003615.pt|if you are able of having a good
mels/028232.pt|the entire interview was a front and i see the real board that we all know he hid it
mels/008610.pt|if the for kicking the tires is now over so he's offered
mels/013825.pt|is argue about games on forums and it was
mels/023550.pt|that is the monopoly strategy what the really scary monopolies like amazon do is they keep these prices low so you never suspect them of a monopoly
mels/022904.pt|was twice tim sweeney stood up on stage and delivered this quote in a ninja headband passionately
mels/030076.pt|would you feel the no gift i was like i was like
mels/004592.pt|the enjoyed it so i got my own subscription
mels/019442.pt|wheat is the best food of man
mels/023143.pt|in visuals are food marketers understand this better
mels/032318.pt|he watched obsessively on his final stream when he completed
mels/011874.pt|and i did not know this going in it is a
mels/001304.pt|youtube in a minute did they just get boring or
mels/019961.pt|ten years it was all like simba from the lion king
mels/028370.pt|it's also a company to say the word net
mels/001203.pt|i felt grossed out and i never really wanted like it was so it didn't it didn't even
mels/001101.pt|interest you have you could be super interested in like i
mels/023819.pt|good luck with the you're going down this year see in two weeks pal those were probably
mels/020772.pt|you know what it is what it do all right
mels/021874.pt|which probably include that because you know how to spit game i love you alive girl i will show you with my body and my lips and my eyes
mels/023249.pt|but i found a quick video it's from
mels/006635.pt|jobs history was to see if it was still possible so like when they were down
mels/006542.pt|they're doing i mean they have a credit card they're doing a lot of things
mels/022722.pt|so acting with the speed that you can tell
mels/002280.pt|of all time isn't it illegal to do that yeah so what are they gonna do
mels/002364.pt|and hopefully you know some i was able to keep you down during the highs as well people always thank me for bringing them up during their lows but you know it's
mels/014038.pt|but they have a generally good positive feeling of ludwig and the thing that youtube gaming needs most is legitimacy
mels/014528.pt|yes king yes that is what the streaming wars is all
mels/025214.pt|sometimes you'll make a big terrible mistake and you have to finally learn to put
mels/005181.pt|it was the day before july 4th it was
mels/021069.pt|was forgettable and the ad is forgettable the
mels/013816.pt|she's again just dominating this console war the console war is making both sides have to make extra money by dumping it on pc so both exclusives are coming to pc pcs
mels/019265.pt|setting itself up to be one of the closest console wars in the history we just went through all those
mels/027559.pt|it's simple if he tried to buy 50
mels/024167.pt|i should just plays the league
mels/011235.pt|it literally not step on my
mels/016718.pt|from home uh sort of quote unquote revolution
mels/008268.pt|the early games like quake you know maybe even doom tribes
mels/018477.pt|they brought their kill streak they pulled it out so we're going to talk about that today we're
mels/019233.pt|look at the look at the time stamp and look at how much
mels/005859.pt|i think as long as he doesn't do anything like that again he i think he can rebuild what he's got which is
mels/026573.pt|actually on this subject let me do a let me do
mels/005262.pt|turning the attention of both groups on to me and i already said hey what's up man you know i was like hey
mels/032374.pt|it bosses and everyone in chat
mels/001488.pt|now here's the question i'm mixing things up a bit here i'm going to ask a question that only i could possibly know
mels/007337.pt|with i won the bet and then
mels/029228.pt|see this curtain and there was like a curtain that led out to the main area
mels/012575.pt|and you know whenever you sign up you get a free stock and then i get a free stock for referring you
mels/005996.pt|go back after the dock and
mels/016767.pt|that replacement right now it's like uh
mels/002735.pt|got paid a dime and you have a hundred and ten dollars
mels/013429.pt|okay you should rethink your entire life but
mels/009852.pt|to like the average amount of people that will be there
mels/008174.pt|the jungle and i'm building a quite a coterie of characters did you win a single
mels/025897.pt|blizzard came out and said uh we don't
mels/017479.pt|senior management who have you know destroyed the value of that company over the past few years
mels/026950.pt|it had a bunch of people take scores as they
mels/003998.pt|what i'm hoping to work and i have made a lot of progress i hired pay and i hired some
mels/004224.pt|it's like an easy way to get um drake's
mels/020645.pt|don't want to go out to a party but you'd like to be invited that's what
mels/031789.pt|but in general minecraft viewers watch
mels/030056.pt|if you don't have passage one on the screen so i
mels/027292.pt|is it and you think about that and i'm like okay on surface level that seems fine
mels/021068.pt|if you've never heard of the whole point is take five
mels/019291.pt|it is extremely favored over the Xbox that
mels/007232.pt|is enron like a deez nuts joke
mels/004969.pt|the the the neural link hidden twins disclosure
mels/001277.pt|i got sponsored by fear factor know it's always been a dream it is funny that when i was i got sponsored by fear factor i know it's always been a dream
mels/015910.pt|but what they're finding out is that as they
mels/006669.pt|and ring it's obviously not but i will say bloons is a game where they nailed all
mels/008150.pt|what's actually been disabled it's actually
mels/019652.pt|at the one and only sweet i see
mels/008629.pt|so you know it's it twitter does get
mels/010719.pt|make business expenses to go to lower tax rate yeah i mean true you should do
mels/006260.pt|cool cool cool cool cool cool you didn't react to the balloons
mels/000960.pt|korea china and uh and they were
mels/006934.pt|and it was also farther from my house
mels/017217.pt|where i discuss the symptoms of in for
mels/019933.pt|amazon bought twitch for a billion dollars okay now that was in
mels/022470.pt|the nike was getting into skateboarding and
mels/001592.pt|no seriously though inflation's a real problem in this country
mels/013961.pt|it you'll just lose more money than the item
mels/002648.pt|but once it comes up you take your money and you leave you will be winning this one this is free money so all i need you
mels/032213.pt|i yet we want to make it last and then
mels/027610.pt|i think sums up what most of them are thinking can someone tell me if i'm rich or if i'm fired i think they're all just trying to figure this out
mels/027415.pt|they have multiple versions all of which are advertised as quote unquote free but often
mels/011345.pt|really stuck with me the first time you said it
mels/020954.pt|i thought about that you're right i want to marry them i want to change my opinion
mels/031432.pt|like poseidon's nemesis because i threw
mels/030791.pt|what a woodwind instrument is it's one of the dumbest bars ever
mels/030497.pt|with the stories of you know
mels/002347.pt|with the day an extra three hour nap does do something it doesn't do a lot but it does do something every time you push it off that's just yeah
mels/022902.pt|it's such a weak mindset okay
mels/010459.pt|one day did you spam roll my monkey ball roll
mels/018596.pt|they're not going to work hard on this but assuming it comes out here's the deal they're the options are
mels/021783.pt|in these trying times we need nature more than ever we need
mels/003895.pt|if the the of them are in power but the republican
mels/013061.pt|or full-time like he ran his own marketing agency and then
mels/026011.pt|if the public domain you can make this cool matrix poo you can draw weird
mels/001075.pt|you ever hung out with someone who
mels/018990.pt|are lost jobs and so the the
mels/008355.pt|turns out he a little wobbly on that thing so things might change it might turn out to be like a situation where
mels/003734.pt|but if we just consistently demand things over and over and say we're angry about things eventually something's
mels/016524.pt|okay it's already gotten bigger counter-strike became the first
mels/031178.pt|the dollars you know like mixer or youtube or twitch would have paid him absurd money
mels/027764.pt|magnificent seven seven stocks that you could rely on for the future
mels/003908.pt|cuban it might be gavin newsom it might be
mels/015199.pt|south america squid games from korea they're making all these shows over the world and
mels/008082.pt|actually you know what you can go ahead and give some right now and it'll make
mels/005684.pt|and i actually had a blast those guys are
mels/029771.pt|if you win singles or doubles you get a mug of beer
mels/027495.pt|it needs a change so you might think i might be against this for monopoly reasons but i'm really not but before we get into all my takes on it let's do a quick disclosure on some of the facts the deal is worth
mels/023596.pt|around it you had a massive oil for that everybody remembers stop paying all these around it you had a massive oil spill that everybody remembers stop paying all
mels/026640.pt|we're really talking about in technology four or five companies that have absolutely absurd amounts of power and
mels/005668.pt|because i learned about streamers and i'm gonna
mels/031894.pt|a friend of mine pulls me aside and he's
mels/010617.pt|it's saturday for some fall guys you mean elric no i don't
mels/018678.pt|the end of the console generation but overall it was a tie then came the reckoning and that is the generation where the
mels/028032.pt|west corporate control they're not taking
mels/004640.pt|i'll be looking for a stable bit of wealth management and we have a full service platform helping to make sure that your
mels/023849.pt|in the kingdom my next w is this i'm talking about the total rebrand of coke zero sugar uh entirely new design that i actually
mels/032073.pt|bts bought our hotel rooms and they bought one for me and blur so me and
mels/022744.pt|motorola couldn't make good phones this might not even be google's fault i don't know but let me tell you motorola could not make a quality phone to compete in the modern smartphone era and so by
mels/030209.pt|that was after he got rich
mels/027851.pt|we we get to learn from it right yeah it is entertaining especially when this guy's
mels/026081.pt|well but this you actually add an image and to
mels/003850.pt|well he's marketed himself to both people
mels/006907.pt|i just never left the office
mels/014399.pt|is vaude easy easy access to
mels/031056.pt|if some early ludwig stories you know i think that's what people want to hear they want to hear about the times before he was filthy stinking rich out of touch in a bubble um i i
mels/031302.pt|this bodega we get to the bodega and i take a water bottle and it's cold and it's good and
mels/000692.pt|the mini bar you do before the restaurant so it's even cooler and there's
mels/016744.pt|nobody wants to be like nathan stands nobody wants to do it
mels/012118.pt|what you in charge of this
mels/015238.pt|pretty confusing graph at first at first but
mels/022105.pt|in sort of from this one everything you've ever done the internet will find there are no secrets
mels/026380.pt|their products have what i have called the flex factor which means they are very consciously consumable when you see
mels/023869.pt|this is a dub there's no
mels/027186.pt|indie darling but it's been top of steam the largest from soft launch ever truly truly a
mels/015514.pt|but as far as i can tell from looking at
mels/006964.pt|probably a bad thing too um
mels/022476.pt|about the world if other sports were treated like skaters i think it was just like a good lesson for me as a marketer on how how important
mels/031126.pt|when he first started growing i was like bro someone like a lyric by the way
mels/026265.pt|of their company beats even mainstays like coca-cola disney

mels/023133.pt|they launched a book called cooking with sky prawns that had 20 recipes and tried to drive
mels/023459.pt|people buying it okay if you want a huge market share you can raise your perceived value really high and keep prices low okay for example think about netflix perfect example netflix could charge more they would get fewer customers
mels/017007.pt|i think i'm happy with it and we got
mels/026484.pt|we of harry potter where all the characters

mels/017918.pt|stuck into watching a hundred more they all
mels/029036.pt|and all just instant reaction push him kind of
mels/000622.pt|brought up the watches were the
mels/010173.pt|the fans didn't get what they wanted

mels/014150.pt|cut off by just months instead of getting massively paid like pokey you're getting nothing you're getting absolutely nothing because
mels/028064.pt|this video of a girl getting an ipod for christmas in
mels/026270.pt|it does not support that line of thought
mels/030381.pt|wonders i put the bag through that has the ring
mels/016065.pt|and his marketing nickname that his fans
mels/028229.pt|twitch had one person for league of legends and two for smash melee
mels/016936.pt|let me talk about public real quick which is a investment app it is similar to an investment app you may know it
mels/020333.pt|and maybe a three because of slime's
mels/005466.pt|the clown ewing we had a good little conversation
mels/027308.pt|the down you know what i'm saying it would
mels/011111.pt|and you know that they're fake you
mels/004072.pt|you know love the content or like
mels/018028.pt|watch the old ad review youtube video
mels/021936.pt|i actually just because people i
mels/019698.pt|well let's talk more in the future sure
mels/013116.pt|if i keep this up literally my net worth will triple okay i read this on a
mels/022640.pt|they took the less angry take if you're going to act you
mels/008831.pt|one cannot buy nvidia nvidia's is far too
mels/023326.pt|now i mean obviously there is one coin that only just prints value and that of course is
mels/002594.pt|love to hear what the next guy has to say unfortunately last guy did not qualify we do have a studio audience here at home that needs
mels/025025.pt|and that's a lot of people who aren't part of like what you consider the gamer block that are always bitching about like star wars battlefront oh fast food
mels/012209.pt|are you just got his he's got his bouncy energy
mels/009005.pt|by step with an elon tweet
mels/001321.pt|primitive technology let's see what they built what's their best building well that's the problem is
mels/028378.pt|you're talking to a superior maybe there's somebody higher up
mels/002360.pt|i have to the front foot puts you right up there at the front
mels/014241.pt|type of person that can get someone to try out streaming and that is what they need more than anything this will grow with time
mels/025573.pt|i thought of me the first win is me
mels/029922.pt|they talked about how no one had beaten the five gods but they made it seem like leffen was
mels/025352.pt|and i was there they're like yeah let's do it so i get pulled in and it was
mels/013692.pt|because it spiked it's the only
mels/022065.pt|political controversial just make sure whose account
mels/014923.pt|playing only china who are bad
mels/017237.pt|it up you know to take a break from drinking
mels/029769.pt|what give trophies they don't give medals
mels/016184.pt|if you want the outcome none of us would be here without come you know what i'm saying put that together
mels/026707.pt|they're not ousting him because he's kind of getting
mels/030777.pt|well you're like god my one time and he's like well
mels/000740.pt|and he's my best man and i'm
mels/019852.pt|kind of mixed reviews and then sort of built itself into a really popular game popular franchise and destiny 2 got even
mels/028017.pt|or role in inflation and for suggesting that the wealthiest individuals on earth should pay more taxes he really didn't like that part it's pretty well established that raising taxes especially
mels/005814.pt|i think he's actually done some funny stuff recently he did the casting of the cup
mels/023179.pt|well i'm like why doesn't mine
mels/010017.pt|i thought it was uh completely ineffective
mels/004236.pt|and then i was like hey crypto yeah you
mels/001765.pt|i guess the point is that people often make fun of grandpa joe for being lazy but when you think about it you know the rich billionaire is probably more appropriate to make fun of especially if we're thinking about real life which is fine the movies themselves do not make fun of grandpa joe at all like the movies themselves make grandpa go out to
mels/020889.pt|what was it again it was so stupid nvidia and video graphics trading cards you said what
mels/000182.pt|what we drank so much so
mels/031411.pt|i like so yeah i thought i'd be swimming around i inst like we all jumped in and
mels/025239.pt|with because i guess people that
mels/029717.pt|in that moment i was i was on team
mels/012177.pt|and i wake up and it's like the first
mels/003787.pt|he is openly taking lobby money from coal companies and then saying
mels/001369.pt|say something say something so i can find you
mels/007735.pt|well he allowed to go to his house and ask for it
mels/021895.pt|very important to him and when i started thinking about terms of the flywheel i actually found
mels/013117.pt|the sigma tweets instagram account that posted pictures of tweets over pictures of
mels/012623.pt|getting wednesday tomorrow i think for sure
mels/008897.pt|tells them what to do and
mels/017766.pt|drastically when he was on twitch
mels/003936.pt|i'll be voting for the amazon party jeff bezos baby big jeff i'm voting for the joker what if we all just write in the
mels/008453.pt|it's tough to do but impressive when done correctly i was the goalie in soccer and i sat
mels/026868.pt|it doesn't feel too cringe by the way keep this in
mels/025340.pt|i hosted uh the twitch weekly show at the
mels/004787.pt|from the first tweet that he just
mels/002872.pt|and he has to pay a big fine his next step from
mels/011267.pt|i'm sorry chat chat i apologize
mels/025057.pt|it's the four big tech brands of the world so
mels/019136.pt|outdoor advertising you know it's a lot
mels/006501.pt|like the second this was announced i mean they're planning layoffs right now

mels/002077.pt|wait on this hand dude and i'll say that's life oh wife lover yeah
mels/028261.pt|the openly illegal but like the most lying manipulative psychopathic um just like gaslighting
mels/030263.pt|john what's going on and he sees the room i came out of and
mels/024722.pt|and everything stays super high then it becomes like it is now where it's impossible to
mels/019574.pt|like the good one we did the vocal in one take
mels/017564.pt|a company that's way smaller than apple
mels/005872.pt|someone who would agree that he should go to saudi arabia
mels/025769.pt|blizzard a storied one going back to all
mels/031610.pt|i can't i i have no ability to move the conversation along this guy liquid
mels/010739.pt|every other minute or they're faulty wires
mels/016684.pt|i an interesting stat but it is uh in
mels/008434.pt|i think talks like this and then we're gonna
mels/000306.pt|just happens so sad again every trip to vegas i've ever had where i do a lot of gambling i have the
mels/012797.pt|we were paid like basically only in
mels/021116.pt|i think this is where i'll make my custard's last
mels/019995.pt|his price of marvel itself they bought marvel for
mels/004088.pt|dream during your lunch break so us est
mels/003293.pt|certain things obviously have been more expensive and some more expensive than others and one thing that has been particularly more expensive and we no longer have to worry about our family dragging us to is boring major league baseball games it's now much less likely that your
mels/001597.pt|now now eight months i think
mels/025366.pt|it's empty i'm the only one here because i'm
mels/019893.pt|the meaningless okay let's get to number two this game is actually good
mels/004272.pt|the number is not allowed to go down uh-oh uh-oh wait a minute that i just solve the only downside of crypto is that you lose all your money cause the number goes down a number is not allowed to go down uh-oh uh oh wait a minute did i just solve the
mels/028248.pt|it was confident and they had good answers
mels/015073.pt|rental business that's still churning along
mels/010337.pt|power for school and for gaming i've been trying to get michael reeves i don't i
mels/028920.pt|is that we get near the top of this hill and i'm so drunk and like loud and belligerent and like just also miserable and i shove this girl and again i feel very bad about this i think trying to like pat her on the back not
mels/011795.pt|when i was there and it looks like you're
mels/031525.pt|well the understand and it's very blurry because
mels/030109.pt|and my dad you know he's
mels/012442.pt|why to this whole time is kroy
mels/010837.pt|i can be by monday that's that's a fact no i can't play
mels/026615.pt|acquisitions this is oculus for about
mels/008203.pt|and i said skip the 40 mil
mels/026416.pt|worse it is a proven phenomenon where car companies will run ads not even to attract new buyers but to make buyers that spend money on their car feel
mels/001646.pt|more discord messages that i that bury the real ones i need to see from like pay but this is a cute
mels/013054.pt|much better job with stricter qualifications
mels/019909.pt|the first major big smash blockbuster super game is quake okay quake is a massive success and it makes john romero the first famous game developer he called it
mels/028873.pt|it was this bar in seoul that if you could show your id and you were a
mels/025033.pt|which is just a declaration of war really taco bell
mels/017739.pt|and the clock model is a way to think about any brand and in fact you can
mels/025762.pt|product also their name dirt devil fits
mels/014929.pt|in a monday but we can't transition from wins and fails to the actual show without a
mels/029925.pt|it has never won a tournament and then so when he finally beat
mels/029203.pt|ads like take small breaks every now and then
mels/027985.pt|give a win here you know how
mels/003033.pt|there was no victim at the theater that that that we found out about
mels/021822.pt|what are his secrets and how
mels/029300.pt|and so he's like you know what come on in he brings me in he's like dude we
mels/023635.pt|yeah i mean this is an extreme dark example but i could talk a little bit about pride as a post concept it it um from brands and from government
mels/011975.pt|the a bad guy and i start getting all the bad
mels/003055.pt|i should have done that after
mels/022439.pt|in the world and they did this ad for years and it's like oh i don't need to be too clever i just
mels/023934.pt|media marketing is little nas x with his new free
mels/008316.pt|in a recession we can pretend things are good i believe by the way we are currently though it hasn't hit
mels/005471.pt|i had a actual barbecue fireworks
mels/014253.pt|and we can handle it but i think what they don't realize
mels/000468.pt|we get there and nick allen as drunk
mels/012992.pt|at the piano or you want
mels/024123.pt|because he's got to go back to his
mels/026785.pt|we asked a winner take all economy
mels/026521.pt|out of character but again i i don't know exactly what this project entails i didn't bother to look into it i just know that it's from a marketing standpoint a bad because your target audience is people
mels/018511.pt|this is microsoft continuing to say we will not lose this
mels/005109.pt|to cure me of clint stephen syndrome and then what they did is they had me play offline smite with clint last night and it turns out close proximity to clint stevens finally cured my disease and gave me
mels/021497.pt|thought they borrowed at four dollars for a hundred and ninety
mels/005674.pt|at the graphs down they got the graphs
mels/009476.pt|a little bit worse as tyler picks up all these minions worth noting tyler also has the
mels/031380.pt|what i think of and and i'm i'm excited this is my idea of a boat this would be fun uh this is the boat that takes us to the
mels/002367.pt|i actually bought a new one but i did not install it
mels/003928.pt|in the wild off the wall take and it
mels/014768.pt|he jumped in to save you stormer thank
mels/013627.pt|as the mischievous drama so i
mels/004876.pt|it does not follow this rule he absolutely
mels/015983.pt|trying to do uber loses money and netflix is trying to do
mels/015711.pt|thanks for supporting i do appreciate it
mels/029479.pt|and if you want to know that twitch story you can find it on you can find it on youtube i told my twitch story the
mels/021376.pt|but i guarantee i'll give them back to you in a month
mels/012219.pt|so i'm facing off people are watching i
mels/015713.pt|take a chance on marketing monday and i'm glad that lily has taken the leap and they went all out with this full
mels/008925.pt|i forgot your name so it's
mels/015453.pt|well combined okay disney has dominated theaters for the past few years but we're talking about streaming wars okay so that's the problem this is the problem if you're doing this good in theaters it becomes very hard internally
mels/023448.pt|which has to be above price and these three lines explain all aspects of marketing
mels/031347.pt|so we get on with that i go to the judge the judge she hears the report and she kind of laughs she thinks it's really funny
mels/001759.pt|i'm not taking any cruise ships back character draws the
mels/011512.pt|i said in a recent video i said
mels/028756.pt|water springs and told me that
mels/018473.pt|the games and their price and we said damn this
mels/003587.pt|the for there's just no there's no upside in the moment
mels/013688.pt|would show up like one fourth of the time to twitter and that is why it has taken eight nine years to even think about an edit button
mels/004434.pt|it's as a guest today and what do you think he would say
mels/027398.pt|starting to realize how much roblox has gotten away with
mels/031694.pt|well the japanese changed my life that sounds like
mels/001963.pt|with everything and becoming what you say a
mels/007895.pt|i have gifted and one of them is atrioc
mels/009300.pt|i anything in a loot box even if it's at a
mels/007288.pt|yeah so i'm i'm like literally front row for all of j mook sets and i'm losing my
mels/024545.pt|you have to keep that a complete secret and that is extreme that's not even like that makes no sense with their argument of like we
mels/021973.pt|and i think this is the right lesson i'm just not sure that jeff bezos really took it his grandfather told him jeff one day
mels/012875.pt|in chaos and hot shot and
mels/000145.pt|incredibly weird and if they do sell it's worths do you realize there's no
mels/029831.pt|in the video for you i
mels/030661.pt|but can't find a winner finally like
mels/018866.pt|at the cranberry what I mean what are you
mels/024885.pt|and you run out of moves or
mels/012713.pt|i mean if they do it right it'll be really cool
mels/013735.pt|yeah he called a public terrorist threat
mels/009381.pt|one hundred percent it works every time without fail
mels/021342.pt|it would be so sick to get that
mels/027030.pt|guy fieri add bud light hard seltzer soda featuring guy fieri
mels/005059.pt|if the the clown he's been a bit of a clown all
mels/003754.pt|well there's no it's not illegal it's totally legal and so uh
mels/016242.pt|i will start off with somebody who is contractually contractually not taking any else that is part of their contract to never be associated with an
mels/026454.pt|it doesn't become part of the mango nation he
mels/022599.pt|we're really excited about playstation flow it's potential to break through traditional gaming barriers is immense
mels/021570.pt|i could lose a lot of money i'm gonna bet
mels/002498.pt|and the main quests are pretty dumb but there's a side quest in deus ex
mels/004811.pt|it was and financing no longer secured in the same way it's gonna be really awkward for him financially now all in the same time
mels/009895.pt|when i started talking about exposing the secrets of billionaires i
mels/028048.pt|you'll get fired which encourages them
mels/002042.pt|if you have crucifix earrings are you more or less religious what is that
mels/025277.pt|as you've said but this is a measure of google search volume for selected series
mels/018724.pt|at the conference and i think they're going to be talking majority about this i'm
mels/016858.pt|big companies are paying absolutely ludicrous amounts uh for
mels/008616.pt|i dunno whatever you know it could be
mels/001736.pt|it'll be seven days because the
mels/026952.pt|well among average watchers i think in my
mels/022729.pt|i the end of it in
mels/018868.pt|there's memes there's a bunch of memes okay let's see sprite cranberry memes
mels/024970.pt|the defective sony product they got or
mels/012313.pt|i don't like everything was like plated kind of well
mels/002034.pt|he's kind of throaty goaty and hopefully
mels/026209.pt|i was using earbuds of and then i have one more thing to talk about i like to end the
mels/021925.pt|so i would pay editors out of money out of
mels/018769.pt|bad we really don't know a lot about it
mels/013707.pt|with the other company than roblox every gaming
mels/010808.pt|the a lot i skip go through morbius one to get
mels/005586.pt|deep dish pizzas like one slice is enough for one person for the night i had two slices and i was
mels/022853.pt|it's so duped because he said like he said
mels/032338.pt|be which on stream the move
mels/019009.pt|what said could fit a quarter
mels/015981.pt|a start making a lot of money that's what amazon did
mels/013307.pt|you are completely misunderstanding this relationship this is not a business where you guys are
mels/002265.pt|and didn't even copy paste it
mels/027256.pt|whether or not they're right that being
mels/016279.pt|in space cd projekt red who promised from their game director on the
mels/017805.pt|was a way to think about marketing that is way more holistic and way more
mels/019751.pt|it's all kind of weird it's all kind of dark and it's all kind of new this is my whether the week because it was way more fire than it had any
mels/002750.pt|let's roll and see what we would have gotten this is
mels/019451.pt|that's not really the point the point is to if you are a car buyer or if ever in your life you are searching for car insurance or whatever to have in your consideration set this brand so if i'm not hungry for
mels/006629.pt|nice to stands on a couch watching that game
mels/028595.pt|it's man cloud he got on
mels/001790.pt|how about my favorite new song oh
mels/001263.pt|which account is it sega west
mels/009724.pt|if the a bad but don't put yakuza vibes it's
mels/002584.pt|for one more chance this is your last
mels/001751.pt|very very and i i read that when i was
mels/009578.pt|okay gold lead yeah it's it's well
mels/026639.pt|buyout is this now sony is this now and this is microsoft
mels/029251.pt|his nickname because he's also like a battery
mels/015108.pt|this is from chief content officer ted serrandos i've mentioned this
mels/014327.pt|why did they just spend money okay
mels/025893.pt|in the court and the idea of beating the case on the
mels/019915.pt|if you weren't around for this ad you wouldn't know you wouldn't know
mels/012961.pt|it out like a really bad economy people that graduated during a recession
mels/011969.pt|there's the good guys the resistance were like hey let's let's get these stumped off the ship was high these fucking cargo it's like do there's the good guys the resistance where they're like hey let's let's get these stormtroopers off the
mels/014787.pt|it and it's it's awesome it's a
mels/022477.pt|your research to really understand who you're talking to
mels/012818.pt|in the biggest i feel like
mels/010750.pt|i'm in the middle of an online exam decided to watch big a instead that is a zoomer level of
mels/003849.pt|with the people that are entirely different in
mels/026218.pt|that these companies use how they're
mels/016742.pt|a fantastic solution for a a populist that will not go vegetarian i
mels/019620.pt|which as you know like canadian prime minister is like almost as high as like a
mels/024065.pt|i think the two takes i saw were like
mels/012017.pt|and so we started to get like at the beginning all the missions we got and the things we got were kind of sent
mels/008812.pt|i mean look twitter is damaged i i i think people that think elon is playing
mels/007072.pt|be really nice to everybody because
mels/010380.pt|oh god it's the witness oh no i'm really
mels/024059.pt|that are making an insane amount of money they'll find a way at the end of the day banks like money okay they may have to make a few
mels/016668.pt|here's one that is relevant to me specifically
mels/011370.pt|alright let's go that's my favorite glorketer
mels/010153.pt|right yeah i know because i
mels/020027.pt|buying android everything cratered and now the world is literally divided between android and ios so if you want to put anything out on mobile you have to use google play are you have to use ios there is buying android everything cratered and now the world is literally divided between android and ios so if you want to put anything out on mobile you have to use google play or you have to use ios there is no other option is
mels/008138.pt|anyway that was funny not worth
mels/016253.pt|i was like you know what i'm gonna go ahead and do that research i'm
mels/003231.pt|and everything they've said for the past
mels/005950.pt|like making his own brand and you don't forget this
mels/010270.pt|i wonder if either of them are available let me ask let me ask i think connor said he was not
mels/003387.pt|in got out and i'm happy because i don't
mels/019355.pt|in development costs by the way i overrode both my partners
mels/018174.pt|we are going to look at different auto manufacturers and how they've approached marketing and we're going to find out who is crushing who is being crushed and what that means to my audience boom before you guys judge some of these ads here's the deal the average age of car buyers by brand this is one thing you need to know going
mels/005292.pt|in the building and i'm like with a group and
mels/008479.pt|but i would bet on you i don't i don't agree with your the way you say it but if i was a betting man i think you could take them as well
mels/023912.pt|i was growing up i like sports more now than i
mels/022137.pt|i to write them get them approved by like always different teams and then set up the sending it was it was really terrible it's a it was not a fun job and i was tired and i was i to write them get them approved by like all these different teams and then set up descending it was it was really
mels/010158.pt|like that i don't really care but
mels/016674.pt|are desperate for solutions for their bad sleep they want to sleep longer
mels/013234.pt|the the internet we'd lose our mind
mels/010881.pt|hey it's about brotherhood it's about
mels/027046.pt|big lord of the rings fan much bigger than me and she saw this ad and she had been really excited for the show and she said this ad kind of killed her hype i
mels/025349.pt|wait that's one of the reasons i got picked i
mels/003717.pt|the think that it's possible to maybe start doing monopoly you know punishments and like
mels/015173.pt|is that this was produced locally in south korea and this
mels/014167.pt|yeah that's where the beginning of this
mels/024251.pt|it would not walk away even knowing what brand it was for microsoft missed the mark on this one so i'm
mels/008487.pt|is your brazil sounds like i'm gonna be
mels/017176.pt|i have begun the process of working on that but i was pretty slow because i had coveted which i'm going to use as an
mels/019260.pt|card into the screen onto the screen
mels/000580.pt|good or not the point is
mels/018183.pt|ash review in my discord and if you have a car commercial please drop it in i'll be watching a bunch of
mels/018065.pt|if the original pepsi man oh time
mels/017301.pt|it's just like one or two random stories not
mels/006066.pt|part of your brain gets to really activate we're talking about the
mels/014207.pt|which if you count gaming vod content or
mels/016927.pt|kind of crazy some of it was very positive
mels/021717.pt|why some people's identity is wrapped up in hating amy schumer
mels/014799.pt|things apply to you i think it's a really cool app i think it's worth signing up for and also if you use it for anything i think if you just
mels/003098.pt|wait let's give a win to um
mels/019271.pt|you know how to make great exclusive and a great next-gen console he posted on
mels/004925.pt|i have been absolutely hammered in the wake of this
mels/009709.pt|it's like i'm sort of the conduit for the sum total of all of humanity's knowledge on youtube and i'm channeling it through me into your brain
mels/006182.pt|you got a perfect analysis situation the second i saw that it wasn't a real enron i didn't make a joke and then take a
mels/009909.pt|i'll turn down the money then you're
mels/031486.pt|and this is not a knock compared to koreans he is trash
mels/030294.pt|and i just get some random guy
mels/032082.pt|the growth is astronomical i haven't seen anything rise so fast and so young
mels/020866.pt|the years and the reason is because of taxes
mels/005598.pt|talk with him he told me that he secretly
mels/015399.pt|explore releases so this was like one of the big innovations that has enabled
mels/021050.pt|is probably one of the funniest
mels/000438.pt|good time that's already a fantastic night but if you start winning more money
mels/003144.pt|that she didn't like snapchat and then the company
mels/025523.pt|i don't believe that speaking of that actually on the same not even just a similar
mels/031162.pt|you're literally watching him live a healthy
mels/003483.pt|word girl yeah yeah yeah we're
mels/003526.pt|i i i couldn't tell you
mels/031719.pt|was translations is the company who
mels/021285.pt|doing something similar to drops in call of
mels/013189.pt|yeah i'm surprised you're telling me now that's dope sounds pretty cold down there though huh weird weird weird
mels/010086.pt|with was something anyway uh i'm gonna try i'm gonna try
mels/022115.pt|the end of a super bowl live tweet but the way they responded did not lean into that
mels/001452.pt|you are the last guest that this show concept will ever have okay okay so this is a real big opportunity for you i want to put
mels/032202.pt|it's a money printer all right so all of
mels/028629.pt|i like i did in college is if i stop working so i create this complicated plan to create fake
mels/012259.pt|so so this kid who i didn't even like i wasn't even particularly nice to
mels/016102.pt|is our economic ecosystem i didn't teach
mels/027151.pt|around it there's going to be
mels/004771.pt|by his twitter stock which at the time of the acquisition was a little bit over a thousand dollars a share this
mels/025625.pt|there who falls into a category of gamers that i like to call the best kind
mels/002426.pt|oh and then i bought through the third party store website and they just didn't but
mels/005518.pt|an example really because i think it was
mels/021059.pt|i just shipped my pants and it's very
mels/022835.pt|because i didn't want to take it up
mels/014297.pt|proving to be i think fairly effective so it's down to this and i think the streaming war has now
mels/029812.pt|cause i don't think i ever really verbalize this
mels/011678.pt|i know star wars trivia i know star wars but i'm not like i've never been the pers the type of nerd that i am is a
mels/006895.pt|lower pack heights and i would skateboard to work down that big hill
mels/026421.pt|well this is this is mango if you guys know that you know i generally will get more viewers than mango but mango has always
mels/016644.pt|fast enough i'm not sure but
mels/031561.pt|that means he can mine again now the game is
mels/018102.pt|the be a good idea as an advertisement it
mels/015843.pt|cause that's where all the other esports are but i don't think you'd go to like hulu to watch it
mels/012963.pt|but just know that it's expensive and
mels/006083.pt|i'm not much of a melee head but i saw the clip with no context
mels/026596.pt|not me i'm not tooting my own horn here occasionally i'll see someone that makes me just just just
mels/001135.pt|i can't imagine that that that is as
mels/003918.pt|i was voting for bernie so i wanted bernie to
mels/004944.pt|the way disaster there if if for whatever reason
mels/015187.pt|the dollars to create korean only shows
mels/023793.pt|what i always wanted to do these for twitch
mels/027185.pt|additionally it's been phenomenally commercially successful it's not just
mels/019605.pt|music was supposed to be a huge part of the campaign but no one can wrap their heads around how to make these five syllables into something musical so they first called in but stewart
mels/024493.pt|into the day we're not gonna accept the result
mels/026896.pt|next up we got mcdonald's 30 second spot
mels/022772.pt|i think so there wasn't even a bidding war bro it
mels/027992.pt|what reputation going into it this is
mels/003239.pt|war though the sharp eyes of readers out there
mels/020559.pt|and i think the smartest thing to do for my
mels/025282.pt|the rapidly trying to i'm sure make
mels/015760.pt|free trial abusing churning and it just feels like no one can really get a foothold that's dominant outside of netflix so the rest of the world's where it's at
mels/011631.pt|she's a fan of and she
mels/015919.pt|i of their lives netflix can still raise prices
mels/014169.pt|when they brought over these two it started to realize that if you get not just one streamer but their group you can start to pull over the audience when you start to get
mels/012220.pt|i think there's a video maybe i'll find the video either
mels/029183.pt|it didn't turn out to be that bad actually was kind of cool but i was a
mels/006181.pt|and i told him because it was a knockoff that
mels/009913.pt|while the ceos to be kind then we have that's the
mels/004676.pt|that i never did it i'll scrub all the vods
mels/032358.pt|but believe what you want and and again i should just ignore this obviously i should just ignore this but it made me furious because of how much time i'd been
mels/008972.pt|is the twitter once he agrees to sign them by
mels/024041.pt|coke sales were going down pepsi was going up and then they came out with new coke and
mels/032110.pt|in the ground watching with us for like at least an hour hour and a half we
mels/010896.pt|we're all company hello fresh and minions have partnered up for what is called
mels/021417.pt|i billionaires but anyway average people
mels/015144.pt|is gone like 20 billion dollars into debt
mels/009074.pt|i used to go there when i lived in germany i would go to the netherlands because there was a american um game and
mels/009677.pt|ignorance is bliss dude ignorance is
mels/017168.pt|the souls of every character in this short film and find the one represents you tag yourself in the marketing
mels/006871.pt|what hearthstone packs and expensed them to
mels/027564.pt|if you thought the company's being
mels/010199.pt|know this about getting pepper sprayed i
mels/017190.pt|you know it was like that it was like you could
mels/004011.pt|in crushing at tft i think he's really high
mels/000406.pt|cards and whatever so in between hands of pai
mels/005893.pt|asking everyone at the table to refer to
mels/021563.pt|dawn tomorrow i think if you bought tomorrow and it spikes like all day and ends up higher you could hold a few more day i mean you
mels/008241.pt|al legend in gaming and esports and content
mels/024286.pt|at least you can see where the money went that is not an ad you watch and go
mels/023032.pt|legally i can't even say what they take they take a lot more
mels/023477.pt|if they can increase their strategy there's two different strategies
mels/017055.pt|at the videos they binge them
mels/012338.pt|want a spaceship right now you wouldn't we
mels/019457.pt|that pepsi ad it was bad it doesn't have the same iconic you guys
mels/001012.pt|after meals she's always telling me off stream that she eats factor meals
mels/012940.pt|like if you if you do it well enough you can get it can spread virally
mels/031498.pt|put in more hours in the
mels/000242.pt|but thankfully thankfully for the table we're mostly winning i mean we're doing
mels/024778.pt|they will offer their best deals their best you know gems to dollars or whatever
mels/012236.pt|so we asked jenny from naboo and
mels/017690.pt|we're shifting away from tech support they
mels/029381.pt|who's elon musk by the way by the way the entire
mels/008202.pt|cause your audience you know is so passionate so rabid such a big fan of the
mels/021424.pt|or money on the people's trades
mels/023295.pt|celebrity and creators which has only gotten more powerful every year i believe it was kylie jenner who
mels/026546.pt|if think ideas and features will get you nowhere and then i looked at his tweets
mels/027693.pt|because this is what the average Democratic senator
mels/004038.pt|actually i think i just spent like three hours walking around and then fighting
mels/001260.pt|but i haven't seen it yet
mels/004376.pt|it'd be generated in 20 minutes so that
mels/004694.pt|and i'm excited to watch the boys tonight at 10
mels/022354.pt|that i would feel cool about wearing
mels/023554.pt|get pissed what amazon does they lower the prices they keep
mels/031567.pt|wave and somehow you add a second wave if you have a second wave
mels/027426.pt|we can't make any meaningful legal progress on on changing the way they are we can always ratio them dude yes yes
mels/026744.pt|so i think monopolies are as american as apple pie yeah i think this will go through
mels/027887.pt|with the shopping online the idea was that uh
mels/018893.pt|the shows are 10 minutes or less
mels/016027.pt|so you guys for watching i want to thank my sponsor one more time lily
mels/023042.pt|and they bundled internet explorer with windows and immediately like overnight like literally overnight
mels/015137.pt|all golfers but it's not all people the
mels/008110.pt|it'd be live you know i wouldn't be used to be live you know it wouldn't be
mels/025167.pt|and moved very fast they bought him a truck
mels/032268.pt|put a rack on red for me on roulette and
mels/012206.pt|and i make it all the way to the final round of this heat in the basement and i
mels/000720.pt|and he's been talking to people and after
mels/014235.pt|so this is what they have to overcome and that is why someone like ludwig
mels/026516.pt|like an instinctual fear of getting further milked by gaming companies i think the last 10 years of gaming
mels/008938.pt|get nothing just as a penalty that's so much money for nothing
mels/027567.pt|were politically motivated there's a lot of like conservative congressmen who just think that elon musk coming to twitter is going to be the greatest thing ever for republican politics i don't maybe maybe
mels/029195.pt|was the biggest stream that twitch it had i'm pretty sure in history at the time
mels/005624.pt|like oh interesting you know i haven't
mels/027898.pt|well the good news is that i'm probably gonna
mels/032032.pt|mike ross and ludwig made a career
mels/015064.pt|i bought friends at the time
mels/018570.pt|and in the next one xbox one was a flop
mels/019283.pt|in my mind to put Halo which is
mels/032270.pt|one of the most degenerate things i've ever heard he is literally teleconferencing we can't we can't take video you can't have your
mels/020805.pt|but i have not yet seen what we're about to watch don't get canceled don't get
mels/027027.pt|we'll stuff with animals that's been their
mels/006840.pt|fucking gets a regular when i'm watching you
mels/000026.pt|hit him with a quick little w yeah i
mels/030642.pt|are in it they start asking questions so it's questions like they start out pretty simple it's like i
mels/004643.pt|in bed and i'm like uh no no thank you
mels/019441.pt|the tone of the barbershop style
mels/002813.pt|of google ceo sergey brin who is now filing for divorce uh now he did
mels/023247.pt|in the pack it was a complete scam and that's why i
mels/003311.pt|hard numbers to estimate that so there's no way we could be in a
mels/031175.pt|because of where twitch prime was at
mels/013853.pt|make a tweet being like uh

mels/027814.pt|so it's kind of like we have a perfect storm of like four or five different things that all individually cause recessions or depressions and they're all here at once and the government just doesn't have the tools to do anything about it at this point it's like it's too late so
mels/009422.pt|it's the best worst worst champion it's
mels/006653.pt|if the before it's too late

mels/032049.pt|rob you look like someone put
mels/022070.pt|i was so obsessed with twitch and watching esports that my real account and the twitch account were almost indistinguishable so i would tweet like
mels/003529.pt|yes just for obvious reasons money you don't have like if you needed a car loan to get a car to go to a
mels/030199.pt|of the night we were both like like out of breath gamers um but he said afterwards

mels/020332.pt|i think i'd probably give it a two and
mels/031144.pt|of flagrant lie but i assumed he was just like not thinking about it too much but what i will say is that there's
mels/013379.pt|where's my camera we got james

mels/019076.pt|the real world with social media as a character we feel like a line has been crossed we feel like there's this is not what we're comfortable doing and especially because at the end
mels/015738.pt|and it was entirely through the free trial then i cancelled um the boys
mels/028414.pt|on military bases i lived on military bases

mels/020538.pt|which bulk of their interest and fan excitement in the first week and they've blown their first week

mels/027541.pt|read the reactions from either side nobody will say like i love twitter the way it was nobody's like twitter's so perfect now
mels/015657.pt|i think the biggest upside i looked at all the data
mels/014009.pt|just a great conversation starter too i
mels/009290.pt|the the problem with loot boxes is people can't really make an informed choice one because
mels/019206.pt|if the throwback story so again I was uh I
mels/002273.pt|his next album i think he waited a long time but yes if
mels/020178.pt|the for forget all they tried to
mels/018677.pt|i ended up barely outselling xbox
mels/003573.pt|i'm a realist things are bad i don't think
mels/008252.pt|one when they had a tiny
mels/011528.pt|in pr team for free and you're broke and you have an anime profile picture on
mels/026381.pt|a walking advertisement for their brand

mels/008940.pt|it's i've heard that argument and and people
mels/009845.pt|or been to chicago to be honest as much as i've been around because the military family thing
mels/007070.pt|in scar that's what i thought was happening most times like when someone would come up to me and ask for a picture i was like yeah
mels/030251.pt|in the shower i was truly gaming it was me and
mels/000653.pt|even though we weren't youtube ballers

mels/014222.pt|start streaming there is a nine and ten chance you will stream on twitch there is a nine in ten chance that every new
mels/000592.pt|as but still we all do we all do edibles we all go into

mels/029849.pt|i am going to stand here and i'm going to
mels/026367.pt|in the appropriate level of service afterwards greatly increased their chances of
mels/003957.pt|it helps with the policy and then tyler1
mels/004428.pt|is he a minion can i just say that it is really awesome when a single meme from a single stream drags on for weeks months years
mels/029907.pt|i believe high standards for himself and where his his shortcomings come from is when he projects those high standards on other people so
mels/021882.pt|in this photo this is patrick
mels/030853.pt|recruiters hey i noticed you from i noticed you from atriox video you

mels/011079.pt|we would understand it because you're not as
mels/003121.pt|i don't think they pay particularly high
mels/002904.pt|it's in america just yet but it's in quite a few countries and i believe it is rolling out
mels/027968.pt|new patches and skins apex legends lives fortnite live service games the problem with those games is that there's too many players you know there's so many millions people playing fortnite that
mels/000458.pt|it's going to be a problem i need a blt so we all drunk food train to try and get a blt but everywhere we go
mels/013415.pt|father when can i leave to be
mels/019807.pt|at the school it was just a week week game it did not seem polished like a million dollars
mels/002749.pt|over a game that i could never win and you could only
mels/008199.pt|my favorite minion so end of the day you know you give a little you take a little for me it's all about i i wouldn't take the
mels/008613.pt|imagine you're an employee of twitter and you're about to be faced with a
mels/003956.pt|in tyler one's the brawn dude
mels/011043.pt|it could be happy except whirlwind i'm not sure what's happened but
mels/009881.pt|at for dollars dollars go way farther in europe than they ever have so
mels/013970.pt|the credit card company will fight for you they have an incentive to keep you happy and using their service so they will accept the chargeback karna and these companies will do no
mels/010818.pt|it'll play a game make it family friendly and i was like oh
mels/010154.pt|outbid and then my dad called me and said hey is this all right i
mels/030914.pt|what nor his mother i thought nobody was listening
mels/006201.pt|it's like how do you just grab my ass
mels/004736.pt|kate himself from the deal that he signed a few months ago how did we get here where
mels/019383.pt|just to steal more market share so
mels/012624.pt|so soon i cannot wait for daily
mels/011602.pt|was really good if you haven't checked it out it's
mels/014852.pt|in a deeper dive on some of the legacy developers that are starting to really struggle and i think
mels/023069.pt|in the thousand dollars and this is the average american that includes every american rich or poor and when you spend a lot of money on food that creates a lot of people that want that money
mels/031924.pt|i'm not a big believer in like public displays of affection and
mels/020859.pt|i also know for a fact that almost nothing that i learned in college has been useful in my real life so that's that what i do say
mels/007189.pt|fly every weekend for twitch and i would
mels/025878.pt|and again in a different environment had this been the one slip up and the community trusted blizzard this one moment probably
mels/012812.pt|the really grind for the college team instead of my quote unquote pro team and then our college team won ivy law
mels/025777.pt|at a time when they needed good news the most they were given bad blizzard's president
mels/031003.pt|and okay so my relationship with
mels/027700.pt|bonus it actually is an ethical business
mels/020988.pt|crack up i could totally relate to the guy thinking it was
mels/028013.pt|where if it's a win i'll say a fail if it's a
mels/028943.pt|truly cannot sniff jack daniels without feeling sick other than that
mels/002057.pt|lives at home and has a dangling cross earring and then she got zero likes
mels/028893.pt|and i'm like let's dance and i would just pick her up and
mels/000998.pt|when a lawyer in a different um
mels/015259.pt|if the king of the jungle the only weakness they have
mels/022119.pt|what this is our shot but
mels/022848.pt|tesla today but i was like you know what
mels/018853.pt|bowl ad the point of this adds the
mels/031354.pt|that my school also has a zero tolerance policy on anything related to
mels/009505.pt|this is over so ninja gets away but what a nice play from yasuo there saying you
mels/014763.pt|with the person i think i brought him on stream for an interview
mels/016695.pt|it over the next 20 years and they're
mels/012487.pt|as was like glad go again you're right you know what let's do
mels/003032.pt|we're fine we're fine no one
mels/020819.pt|i was a lot of way congratulations
mels/016225.pt|we should bring back the classic we should actually bring back the
mels/028249.pt|it's pretty good what we do behind the scenes
mels/016971.pt|and then we'll knock out a
mels/009480.pt|team and they're going to get ahead and then give
mels/006852.pt|and then i push it off the curb and then i get back on yeah yeah yeah wicked
mels/025166.pt|this guy just was like vibing to a classic 70s track
mels/008999.pt|what's going on with twitter i
mels/006537.pt|our profits in because they're such a big
mels/005932.pt|i say about this actually i want to
mels/031331.pt|last minute red eye to atlanta to help me in court so my dad flies out and one thing i'll say one
mels/002928.pt|are staying power or makes people
mels/011764.pt|well i didn't know that it was gonna be
mels/023877.pt|the to lose to the robots
mels/015181.pt|at the oscars and then two years later he
mels/000529.pt|but it was a lot of the same people last time we were in vegas
mels/022935.pt|be a win-win the longer this drags out it will be less so i cannot think of a scenario where epic
mels/010240.pt|if the of dollars when i told my dad what that thing
mels/028631.pt|if the meetings i'm sneaking off to the computer gaming area at twitch and playing league of legends games
mels/025355.pt|his office and they were sitting there like they owned the place i'm walking in i
mels/021055.pt|you can ship your pants right here
mels/020836.pt|if the motivated i want to
mels/002461.pt|i remember was that they looked
mels/028036.pt|society here and when things tilt towards the winds eventually it comes back and i do want to say we are due for the empire striking back
mels/008655.pt|what of evidence twitter has manually reviewed nine thousand accounts every month they've got independent verifier
mels/015025.pt|hold i repeat hold can you just hold would you
mels/028300.pt|the ply thing is a real thing he brought
mels/026224.pt|thing but technically you can pay later but if you were to miss
mels/010853.pt|it was like saying come on i i want the points i don't
mels/017141.pt|i could do it if i
mels/026983.pt|i you know what you know i like this ad
mels/028240.pt|and i was like damn this resume looks good
mels/025641.pt|i broke my brain on this one this is the only one i could not find a hero in a story of two villains okay so you
mels/015146.pt|what you billion dollars of debt to just buy content now they don't make
mels/000795.pt|a big chunk of that i give it to
mels/005934.pt|at typing up this is the
mels/025691.pt|i the have any specific meaning and it's open to interpretation
mels/008002.pt|it's a compliment to myself i'm not
mels/031366.pt|significant others rochelle ari and cutie cinderella did a little triple date
mels/004000.pt|i can actually do both things well
mels/023268.pt|i can't and uh so i concocted a taste test
mels/018393.pt|the mclaren jeff bezos has a monopoly on being a hot
mels/021875.pt|very soon the trick is to be very ominous and robotic that's how you spit game like
mels/009876.pt|bikes in amsterdam go crazy never did that but i assume so
mels/031552.pt|it was losing this is the guy who's losing the
mels/018401.pt|as a little bit different that's why the bounty wouldn't be helpful
mels/028699.pt|i think people i met a lot of people
mels/019338.pt|we had as you can see in this graph
mels/025670.pt|either things happened one when there
mels/017278.pt|in response to winnie the pooh going
mels/007732.pt|amen deliver them all personally with a little jig so he should
mels/001849.pt|to truly construct and run that city
mels/018827.pt|even people who like eating meat alternatives are probably not a big fan of cardboard
mels/019804.pt|if the original kickstarter campaign it was critically panned it was boring it was pretty bad it looked like an amateur game
mels/026213.pt|or buy now pay later by the way if you don't know about
mels/010490.pt|one or something and if you haven't watched that one then you you have to watch that first and then you could say it's not for you that's fine
mels/009066.pt|maybe it's this oh yeah yeah yeah wait no there
mels/015592.pt|but extra money from the markets and uh
mels/017867.pt|i just google it watch commercial these new apple watch ads are incredibly creepy is this it yeah like i said i don't think apple's advertising is particularly good lately i don't think they've i don't think they're out they're not
mels/029687.pt|i was losing i made a comeback i was down like three games of one or
mels/013298.pt|if the full gorilla suit so it's not it's not
mels/015063.pt|which is nothing that's nothing that's like mr
mels/017714.pt|okay it is impossible to use airpods ipad iphone etc in public without people knowing what they are they they
mels/000152.pt|the cousins we had to cut from the list because we haven't i mean
mels/000767.pt|i have to strip or anything we make them compete in a game of smash brothers
mels/002742.pt|in a new answer from you a hundred and i
mels/023255.pt|it almost feels like a beverage
mels/014747.pt|by the one and only king delroy
mels/031827.pt|are the big hot tub streamers but i
mels/020231.pt|or again i think it's so funny that they posted they posted congrats to batman
mels/019967.pt|then they they warm up to it they start going through ideas and then seven billion reasons later which is the purchase price they got pixar making steve jobs absolutely insanely wealthy because he bought
mels/013830.pt|they had to do something dumb they're
mels/011058.pt|plus even back then they all died of
mels/009775.pt|china's got a whole lot happening it's crazy time
mels/027660.pt|well the other way is the subscription route and that is what's been talked about a lot is they're going to find a way to make
mels/031339.pt|would have been mad he wasn't he didn't yell at me at all
mels/031713.pt|people that purchase that vhs and that's
mels/005541.pt|but i'm sure it'll be amazing and i know how it like
mels/022564.pt|i was real life reminder that you can't ignore you can choose
mels/009282.pt|what do you think is a good way to escape the here we'll do

mels/019011.pt|that's my gamers that's the gamers i know why would a brand want to do this what what's the benefit because your first reaction a lot of you is creepy this is creepy right that's the why not they're cheaper significantly significantly cheaper now let's say you wanted to
mels/008976.pt|i think there was like a recruiting executive
mels/003120.pt|and warehouse workers and delivery drivers are not included yeah
mels/009819.pt|a nuclear so it's going to be harder to switch to electric heating
mels/005155.pt|me tell you one thing about the very nice woman at the nail salon she was not familiar with the
mels/024341.pt|why they should care about your company dude this is so up your own ass at the
mels/005569.pt|in trouble and that's fire that's a really nice thing to do
mels/026984.pt|the concept the concept's great by god the
mels/019277.pt|right around here when their biggest and by far most hyped and most important
mels/009165.pt|the most important thing is that when you get a one out of ten video and you go to your dashboard it pops confetti everywhere like you're scrolling through your dashboard
mels/004003.pt|really back to it in a major way
mels/004398.pt|in chat by the way everyone

mels/010152.pt|the patriot poster sold for 800.
mels/024345.pt|i can't walk away with this
mels/013754.pt|i just a week ago it was about riot and blizzard a tale of two companies and how one of them just a few years ago seemed like darling
mels/024886.pt|they will threaten you with losing all your progress if you don't spend money for
mels/014285.pt|add the clout in the and the clout and the and the drama and
mels/012904.pt|nvidia and every single person in my life told
mels/002473.pt|it's super loyal to lays they just needed a

mels/014366.pt|what gamers so that's one more nuclear bomb the next over here i have is drops twitches drops
mels/001950.pt|i would never do that without taking a
mels/007039.pt|follow commissions but worth checking out does
mels/016567.pt|lots and lots of education based startups are being funded right now because the gap between what people need to get and the cost of it has never been higher so
mels/019992.pt|and insane amount of merch and insane amount
mels/011759.pt|they're like oh is that from the outer rim
mels/022632.pt|i have a shot at it
mels/008697.pt|as behind uh how they come up with their bot
mels/008974.pt|it'd be a red car when i bought a blue car and since he bought the company they froze hiring changed nothing except they fired
mels/007979.pt|should be pretty fun a lot of question marks
mels/019057.pt|if you guys want to follow my twitter
mels/024202.pt|isn't that was hurt was like i guess ninja's
mels/022057.pt|taking a look at what the hashtag is for sometimes they know what it's about and they don't care like in the example here kenneth cole here fashion brand did know what hashtag cairo

mels/014470.pt|what of people were telling him to go a certain way a
mels/019177.pt|advertising where you basically say your competitor's name has fallen out of
mels/028965.pt|i am ahead of me and i don't i don't know what i'm going to do

mels/019025.pt|at the film a dead body in japan in the suicide forest well that's tough now currently i'll say
mels/018775.pt|it's coming eventually it was embarrassing but they had to announce something to get people excited again and the real
mels/017923.pt|they focused way more on this area to get repeat consumers
mels/004810.pt|it's played as written there's no real weaseling out and if he is on the hook for
mels/004554.pt|right about now is jump into the
mels/031236.pt|and i had a favorite player i've mentioned him on stream
mels/004476.pt|doubling the meat in a food shortage

mels/010085.pt|so we have either the cheesy bacon ranch shredded chicken we have the shredded chicken taco bowl or we have i don't know what this is
mels/015925.pt|in use of ai to determine what you might want to
mels/023298.pt|we're a day it died after a day
mels/030641.pt|michael and that's it that's the only fact i took from the book and i'm in the geography bee and it's like i'm a little nervous all right because we got all the kids up on the auditorium stage and uh a lot of them are older than me

mels/015360.pt|whatever your tax amount is and save it from your bank account as your money comes in and that
mels/029760.pt|good time especially given how hard
mels/030911.pt|i think about it anyway i'm going to get you wits and
mels/016504.pt|is growing exponentially like a hockey stick it's worth spending at least five
mels/024381.pt|in find is that it starred nicole kidman obviously very expensive and they got director
mels/018025.pt|one of the first fully branded video games of all time i have heard that this
mels/012076.pt|i get the actors big props they kind of make the whole
mels/029894.pt|the twitter app right in front of me because
mels/013095.pt|we're at the time a little bit which is uh three
mels/028917.pt|there were certain i would throw up in their vehicle no soul taxi and again i've taken a lot of taxes
mels/020569.pt|it's an entirely different thing okay one of them is easy to bounce back from the other one isn't
mels/017972.pt|what do you think about it but in the moment i was like this is so
mels/017799.pt|you would actually see a significant drop off in
mels/002120.pt|well off the wall take it sounds like totally impossible but i think twenty twenty four we might see the biggest number of third party both we've well off the wall take and it sounds like totally impossible but i think 2024 we
mels/015476.pt|the stuff for free all included they could crush but they don't
mels/027453.pt|the voice of the taco bell people was one of the first
mels/007998.pt|both directions by the two most important
mels/027092.pt|stock market is is down a bit this year maybe because of inflation i want to ask you specifically about inflation are we looking at a prolonged decline
mels/002865.pt|at which could be massive and it is looking like that is a
mels/032166.pt|give up the pit boss's biggest fear
mels/023485.pt|a million dollars a year to be the official truck of the nfl that's why you see so many goddamn truck
mels/017166.pt|it's error and uh and that'll be that and then i
mels/010943.pt|a little bit and so i will be
mels/020778.pt|it wasn't this year but it could be any
mels/012067.pt|i'll give him big props he actually made the
mels/015276.pt|willa they're made of pure muscle they have a ton of money and their current strategy
mels/018357.pt|san francisco which is way below market
mels/017242.pt|at a dub and not a fail that's a
mels/015284.pt|wrong strategy but it's a risky one okay but if it doesn't work if this doesn't work they have a powerful backup money lots and lots and lots of money that is their powerful backup okay they have a lot more money than almost anyone else
mels/016890.pt|at everything you're doing just gets better rewards and so people in the digital media economy are seeing massive success
mels/011635.pt|fake spaceship where you can literally live on the spaceship okay and everything's in character and it's a whole it's like a legitimate
mels/026990.pt|if the first of all this is one
mels/020679.pt|if they've calmed down a bit the night never ends we have a fourth award a lot of my awards go to the huge companies the big games the big marketers but we always put one award in for the little guy that's why this award goes to the surprise indie no marketing hit of the year

mels/020361.pt|i was going to put it as a four or five it's great great great
mels/025252.pt|in the favorite clip on twitch to sort of sum it up talking a lot in the movie
mels/012846.pt|put in i had put in like 14
mels/005622.pt|as an entertainer completely dead forever
mels/003613.pt|fucking the cost of rent and housing is so high that like
mels/000626.pt|it was such a nice time that it made me rethink my life and i'm like maybe i'm working too much
mels/021276.pt|years that are just what makes twitch and youtube way ahead of the pack okay one of those features that has kept
mels/028709.pt|oh yeah i'm press team liquid
mels/016472.pt|welcome to marketing monday today's topic 20 or so
mels/022867.pt|at the top five worst acquisitions of all time thank you for watching targeting tuesday in the
mels/016193.pt|you know the whole thing the whole thing the
mels/009847.pt|plenty of west have collaborated on music you'd
mels/000978.pt|the question is so difficult to answer
mels/015203.pt|and you'll notice it with this example
mels/008862.pt|fighting this tooth and nail right and so
mels/027558.pt|printing a bunch of new shares it dilutes the amounts of shares there are so that they
mels/028294.pt|with plans to expand the vod feature
mels/021329.pt|into this problem people are just generally lonelier i think they have generally
mels/017692.pt|or trying to find ways to not do it and instead apple
mels/028871.pt|how am i alive yeah i totally yeah yeah
mels/026016.pt|nude he be your poo is free which just rolls off
mels/004908.pt|with this extremely high offer for
mels/021957.pt|the company no one else can do it
mels/015945.pt|why everyone else has kind of struggled at
mels/019686.pt|peter scott king delroy check out his music check out
mels/011334.pt|i would be tomorrow wouldn't it
mels/023196.pt|fuck you this one's for like real california types they'll say
mels/024910.pt|didn't hit it last time which by and large is not true they have
mels/004026.pt|what's play out of my mind let's play that
mels/010793.pt|i kind of do at first i was
mels/001522.pt|one second i'm thinking about it
mels/025485.pt|i think the current stock market is at
mels/005042.pt|of money from burger king this is actually
mels/030468.pt|if the mood here all right
mels/008475.pt|no i wouldn't i think they're amazing no
mels/003566.pt|i was let go two times in four months
mels/016939.pt|at the same functionality the same cleanliness uh i use it every morning
mels/028143.pt|they are losing money and so naturally a company that only makes 50 million in
mels/024913.pt|ninety plus roles but in general the idea
mels/005811.pt|he lied obviously that's bad and then you should there should be some
mels/026817.pt|what they just sort of slide so facebook realized that their core business is
mels/029435.pt|like literally it's like a dwight kind of guy he looks like a dwight he is a dwight
mels/030227.pt|credit for that jordan had his flu game
mels/024086.pt|they were one of the quickest adopters of uh food
mels/007656.pt|we've been working on it so
mels/019332.pt|these market which is like high-end
mels/019293.pt|well but the theme of all this is to say that it's going to be a real war which is incredibly good for the consumer so if you're interested and if you haven't
mels/018440.pt|is the winner for life now i haven't seen
mels/011956.pt|you know i i like i was like oh this
mels/014414.pt|it's doable why don't they that's what they
mels/018034.pt|a flat tire there are a bunch of people gathered in
mels/005136.pt|well he does not have any homophobic donations as far as i know
mels/021308.pt|and i think if you look at these numbers
mels/027003.pt|big celebrities it's hard to win by picking a bigger celebrity and getting more celebrities and getting more colorful and more song and dance i
mels/022812.pt|is on planet earth at this
mels/014286.pt|would have a big impact and i think youtube's
mels/026058.pt|this happen that's insane anyway so tech education for for toddlers is actually really important because alexa will try to test them and kill them if they're not ready
mels/020187.pt|white the crab with laser eyes aerial font 32
mels/023051.pt|money on the fortnite on the store fortnite's going to lose its you know
mels/004751.pt|and he acquired all this money through debt
mels/012327.pt|okay so yes the food and drinks were good
mels/019736.pt|can i say that you're a computer
mels/019107.pt|at real i don't like it i don't want to watch more of this this makes me
mels/022771.pt|to confirm it was ten thousand dollars per user they had about half a million users on
mels/016933.pt|we have to get involved in something that you don't necessarily
mels/014048.pt|short term didn't foresee that outcome
mels/031212.pt|from my criminal record it takes place in atlanta not far from the headquarters of the
mels/025915.pt|is censorship this is terrible by
mels/019734.pt|eminem came back hard with a
mels/007401.pt|it's not true i don't think people did that i think anyone flew out it was like ask skip topic i even though it's not true i i don't think people did that i don't think anyone flew out and was
mels/011605.pt|a bit of uh that streak in me i don't like to
mels/006460.pt|i spend all the time for their artists to create the assets in their game of everyone else's blockchain items it's so much extra work and doesn't help
mels/026284.pt|purchase this happens while you're buying the item and this
mels/018038.pt|weird strange mask running through my living room this is
mels/021628.pt|it's pretty good i like how often the product is
mels/029983.pt|was like a natty number one you just
mels/030317.pt|the through i just i interrupted why so serious and everybody thought it was funny i mean it was like
mels/028129.pt|they're like roundabout way using spax to go
mels/022469.pt|about the thought process this is when
mels/028781.pt|i was a smart kid and i prepared for
mels/019662.pt|with you forget the melody and
mels/018471.pt|when we talked about sony and they're actually that was probably marketing
mels/009700.pt|and so when they call me butt it makes
mels/030634.pt|we should probably practice or like learn something and
mels/015748.pt|we're going to have we're gonna get 300
mels/007004.pt|and i was walking to my seat and one guy
mels/028924.pt|it's girl into a bush and she like fell down into this
mels/030996.pt|with sf was so cause like right in
mels/000110.pt|when your friends and it was like through
mels/024033.pt|with the backlash they got was insane
mels/024058.pt|insane amount of money i'm sure like most businesses that are
mels/016356.pt|and essentially it is about how the uh
mels/027719.pt|i can't even I don't think like
mels/025040.pt|an orange julius dominoes and dominoes
mels/015501.pt|i think unlikely i think netflix is purely focused on content but
mels/005630.pt|if the happen like literally nothing happened like
mels/007816.pt|the slides together if i have a jeff bezos
mels/001445.pt|i mean the bachelor party ideas i mean i'm doing the
mels/019228.pt|as a marketer the Wii was genius okay
mels/007920.pt|if the that i can't argue with that honestly you probably speak for the chat you also i
mels/020863.pt|it probably doesn't even register in your brain this probably
mels/009645.pt|of our towers are down what
mels/032188.pt|it was great okay and uh saturday night i take a good chunk of
mels/013912.pt|tough tough to follow the album
mels/007786.pt|a video like what if i just put out another
mels/013360.pt|that's just i mean that's nightly news
mels/026841.pt|i get i'm using the patented system that i developed last year to accurately rank all ads actually great for ads that were
mels/018000.pt|if the pressure is available to stop them
mels/009490.pt|it's printed from his deaths but still that
mels/029317.pt|the show up we show up for this tour and all
mels/016455.pt|there's been an increase in labor
mels/013132.pt|what the europeans call battle soccer
mels/014375.pt|then the culture and this is a massive one and this is the one that you that
mels/017601.pt|i just a video example of
mels/001799.pt|in the esports and gaming space
mels/018278.pt|the toyota corolla is just the car to get you from a to b when a
mels/024984.pt|it's a crazy kind of powerful of germany to stand up to amazon amazon is actually in america the number
mels/014825.pt|as that nobody's buying them okay oh that's tough that's tough
mels/010148.pt|oh and why did you get pepper sprayed
mels/004994.pt|the second option is that they
mels/002954.pt|if the like everyone's talking about the gray man do
mels/022347.pt|this is what peak mail performance looks
mels/014127.pt|the numbers weren't changing they bought shroud they bought
mels/031672.pt|watching and then all of a sudden
mels/024246.pt|it was part of like a documentary and
mels/024629.pt|it's forward less than three months maybe i think a
mels/008987.pt|well there are already free right
mels/000304.pt|so night one goes great we go back to these these sweets
mels/015755.pt|the the general philosophy was that everyone would be like netflix and if
mels/030307.pt|i said i am i am superior to you as a
mels/021410.pt|that's the gamma squeeze okay that's that
mels/011960.pt|after this happens i get a text message from
mels/000143.pt|you should put three wedding invites on ebay starting at
mels/006046.pt|that's just their culture yeah he told me
mels/025495.pt|in powerful very strong earnings sounds
mels/021210.pt|came in with the largest backlog of ip ever seen everything else all
mels/017616.pt|different direction than other tech companies
mels/018266.pt|dogs having to drive to the vet over and over and really it takes a special chef to cook all those ingredients into one
mels/029439.pt|do you want to be an entertainer do you
mels/032176.pt|of chip i repeat this process of chipping
mels/026880.pt|bad jokes then we get to the avocados
mels/009200.pt|i do it's crazy you have friends that play starcraft
mels/026287.pt|is where traditional things like advertising has
mels/031808.pt|it anymore i am now officially a twitch frog
mels/005482.pt|and then just turns away and walks
mels/011302.pt|i just wouldn't open discord i
mels/024234.pt|at an expensive director let me check my notes here oh well okay the ad starts former
mels/010353.pt|in what way does that sound like your first grade birthday how does me gaslighting lyric with three characters playing fall guys sound anything like your first grade birthday a ghost
mels/022421.pt|or whatever it just the whole idea of like trying to like logically argue your way to a better product in marketing
mels/023152.pt|or deleting it and it got me thinking about like all the pressure there is from all these like glossy burgers in the fast food magazines to look good and
mels/020816.pt|exactly a little bit off script
mels/025793.pt|talk about riot games week okay riot games breaks records with arcane as
mels/029007.pt|i could easily do it you couldn't beat mango yes i could dude
mels/004148.pt|it'd be the money dude you're
mels/009339.pt|i get invited to mr b stuff
mels/017833.pt|make it a little more concise than the three
mels/027362.pt|if the things that are required like to make sure this passes that test it has to be these
mels/008484.pt|i know you know that's more threatening you know what i'm
mels/029013.pt|with you all right i gotta i gotta take a call we're fighting
mels/022990.pt|in additional game levels enhanced graphics for a fee there's money being made
mels/013471.pt|to the next level dude look at this toddler with zero income broke and how he turned his life around by grinding and now he's the youngest actor in the
mels/029963.pt|monday i'm not doing it i wanted to
mels/023640.pt|into the mainstream so there is a benefit but as an
mels/008230.pt|it's not going to work outside of that
mels/021907.pt|i think about this flywheel and if i get
mels/020091.pt|come over to apple john scully and then that guy and steve
mels/009734.pt|no burn it won't do anything if
mels/002971.pt|minor spoiler is that you know the whatever the horror bad guy thing is in nope it can turn off
mels/005632.pt|but no big deal like hey what's up man how you doing and
mels/014340.pt|im us i want to use that same paradigm here twitch needs to become youtube faster than youtube
mels/019888.pt|but this person said it it's
mels/019472.pt|i was blaming it all on
mels/010171.pt|and you wouldn't feel this be authentic
mels/004377.pt|it'll be funnier you said it what is this what is this steve
mels/000136.pt|and then at that point when i was showing off a nice jersey you thought it was a good time to call
mels/001308.pt|and do whatever it takes so it you know then then you can
mels/028923.pt|it was like one shoulder on her arm one shoulder on his but like
mels/003517.pt|as happened in some form before and the
mels/003325.pt|more likely to get a wage increase that was higher than if they stuck around
mels/019490.pt|what and while you're at it if you're feeling frisky talk one forever and with this
mels/003664.pt|you don't like then you know it it's fine in my mind obviously all their needs should be
mels/009365.pt|i don't think i don't think so i don't think so
mels/002891.pt|if the to liquidate quite a bit of tesla shares
mels/023944.pt|to the controversy from the last thing he did so he just keeps doing things
mels/017121.pt|state your name i don't i
mels/010655.pt|then after all the notes are done is done like the prep then after all the notes are done and he's done like the prep he brings me
mels/001477.pt|and i realized that even if they don't
mels/029551.pt|was because they they invited a lot of bailly yeah
mels/022271.pt|you obviously only wanted to spend
mels/018828.pt|is so sparsely featured and the journey
mels/016540.pt|somebody interested in the esports industry whether it's as
mels/030730.pt|i got married yet i just proposed actually outplayed wow what is
mels/024762.pt|show you some more examples of the money they make these are five of the recent
mels/015466.pt|massive every family in america would need it okay everyone
mels/012085.pt|open mind and i'm just pointing out the parts i thought really fun at the end of the
mels/021505.pt|the hedge funds so let me explain what a hedge fund is because i think a lot of
mels/010652.pt|clint's oh yeah so clint oh yeah so clint so yeah
mels/020368.pt|okay why wouldn't they just make it his wife character
mels/000166.pt|mike tyson shows up i'm not kidding i'm literally not
mels/007111.pt|and i clicked on one middle of the road
mels/022719.pt|and then they got a new ceo and now
mels/032205.pt|luxury watch shop and we're looking
mels/016257.pt|all the way into the season opener against the
mels/029559.pt|i we have a line to
mels/025542.pt|if a lot of other labor action across the country there was a number of strikes in in
mels/022789.pt|if the people money then you've also acquired their debt so you could lose more than what you paid so bank of america bought countrywide for
mels/010008.pt|who's better pay the musician or
mels/012354.pt|so on day two on the saturday they the ship lands part of the
mels/022546.pt|of a bad one this is kind of
mels/025518.pt|there are getting sold instantly uh so
mels/019908.pt|let me give you the back story
mels/016925.pt|i thought that was really interesting i did a lot of research on all that stuff and i
mels/018660.pt|i think about marketing a lot i got some opinions on it and i have some pretty strong opinions about what's about to happen with sony versus microsoft
mels/009664.pt|and hindsight but what are you gonna
mels/029098.pt|that baby elon musk oh i wanted to watch this dude i wanted to watch the history of
mels/027875.pt|i bought a recession i can't tell you
mels/017891.pt|touch points in the purchase and post
mels/026460.pt|way to think about marketing that is way more holistic and way more
mels/015929.pt|the thumbnails are ai generated and they change based on your preferences so for example if you really liked
mels/019924.pt|it was like a kind of cooler quake clone if it had released when it was first announced so as boomer as it is if you look at the whole history of games
mels/011124.pt|in the volume up and down uh you
mels/003319.pt|which is actually a good thing let me give a a
mels/011279.pt|do that i'm invisible to all
mels/019413.pt|today's marketing monday is about jingles the best part of waking up is marketing monday on your stream
mels/008893.pt|he's owning the lib so hard yeah
mels/011814.pt|what mickey mouse has a gun to their family's
mels/022060.pt|from social media managers and teams is
mels/016854.pt|i mean listen if you're looking for a job
mels/003696.pt|movements can happen things can change um it's not impossible people
mels/027469.pt|but a great question would be asking why are world leaders why the earth is now losing
mels/026193.pt|death stranding style movie and i'm
mels/018378.pt|we're like workers owning the product ever now only fans still big corporation
mels/010557.pt|have you would ruin my night no i have no desire to do it i
mels/019998.pt|this is but i'll try to explain
mels/023996.pt|all the adult content is gonna
mels/026635.pt|now let's rescale this chart with the value of sony as a company and remember i said microsoft
mels/014115.pt|god bless ninja for making that move because now all platforms have to put a dollar amount on streamers so literally people are paying me and all my friends to do
mels/021294.pt|we'll see that and do nothing as they've always done i predicted
mels/014404.pt|i think essentially ludwig's announcement today
mels/017511.pt|it's like i'm a different man now i have different goals i have different i understand what's important
mels/002923.pt|i literally watched it today it was just very forgettable it was fine i i watched it and i had my phone
mels/025597.pt|it's like someone's in his ear like hey
mels/011416.pt|gift for the scene i swear to god i don't
mels/010356.pt|my first grade birthday was at a
mels/021589.pt|i was going up and the second
mels/003488.pt|unless stuff we talked about today
mels/016973.pt|were you guys you know what i'm gonna
mels/018618.pt|if the for netflix they said yeah just give us a little bit of a cut you can put it online the real
mels/010936.pt|i think we necessarily need to
mels/022787.pt|close to zero then what you've lost
mels/014778.pt|is from personal and business so that's what i'm going to
mels/011840.pt|in the windows are big and and it's like i'm walking around
mels/016873.pt|this one is relevant to us right here right now and this one actually had
mels/018621.pt|so they started paying billions of dollars netflix
mels/007707.pt|finally get my goal right that makes a lot of sense
mels/018276.pt|you know i used to have a corolla
mels/016299.pt|let me tell you the three
mels/002889.pt|ash that you have to pay up is not something
mels/016424.pt|into to inflate away and then when all the money gets
mels/030210.pt|or try of it because he won the first one
mels/000549.pt|so i had thought about that but i'm not
mels/029721.pt|yeah i remember look going back and
mels/012164.pt|one faction because i was only getting the evil stuff and you know i wanted to try
mels/019435.pt|and i was there and i remember they weren't that good back in the 15th century
mels/007876.pt|in the worry because i put out 3 000
mels/026750.pt|it was able to buy sony they have the money sure they can't do it the money's
mels/005449.pt|he was so excited and energetic when he asked for it and this is the picture that's crazy that's wild um same
mels/017907.pt|i other apple products it links into buying an apple watch that's that's the power they've had
mels/011253.pt|when robin one of my other roommates when she first moved in she did a
mels/000504.pt|and then i pass out and then i pass out
mels/024979.pt|is about finland is all about like egalitarian
mels/026222.pt|that is more than the number of people in that age group that are afraid of war or death they are more afraid of credit card debt than dying as a generation and theoretically if you pay
mels/016881.pt|if he is now dead uh it is
mels/010063.pt|we are able to get smarter at all zoomers are unable to learn
mels/005001.pt|if we're gonna say the bots were too high
mels/016019.pt|dubai guess youtube's actually a pretty big deal i think it's uh i think it's worth
mels/013958.pt|in lifelong debt karna and these apps if you start to
mels/001053.pt|see that i've gotten away from my dota roots those were the days we would just get on and we'd play morning to night dota and everyone in
mels/030187.pt|or like all right on your mark get set go and we had money on it we had

mels/031410.pt|well yeah i mean i don't
mels/017421.pt|number two increased social media presence means doing things like going to a party and getting while drunk can
mels/014376.pt|oh and and ludwig might be able to help solve the culture of twitch the
mels/026221.pt|use these products is because they are afraid of credit card debt in fact one of the main drivers of klarna's audience is that
mels/025550.pt|we like cheating the system to like
mels/028734.pt|we've got one vip ticket for you to the
mels/019415.pt|we gotta get that clean for the intro so everybody pog again and for that
mels/004648.pt|as who i was speaking to big fan of marketing monday keep it up from that guy from the as to who i was speaking to big fan of marketing monday keep it up
mels/015125.pt|they noticed everyone likes to binge
mels/031012.pt|we're starting to like i thought maybe you'd fix the mold
mels/032276.pt|so we get the entire crew and it becomes like this story it's like for slime we're
mels/030947.pt|what the first verse yeah i know it
mels/011551.pt|cause that says yes i'm going to engage you
mels/025240.pt|well the couldn't play would start to watch

mels/012598.pt|we're showed up and played his clarinet
mels/021595.pt|i just realized you talked about unethical wall street is for an hour while wearing
mels/022130.pt|at the end of the day you only exist to sell more of a product and we understand that and the more clearly you understand that i think the better your social can be people are not opposed to brands on principle if you are aware and honest that you're trying to sell something people are generally either ignore it or they're receptive
mels/012610.pt|so it's a good start it's a good start
mels/016813.pt|i'm the guy that goes on every old song and i post i go to old concert footage and i post
mels/022709.pt|what a billion and one dollars looks like this is what three million dollars looks like
mels/026866.pt|with a seashell over and over and over and over again without without tying it back to
mels/011688.pt|on the flight and in the car right there is
mels/006910.pt|weren't on the apartment yes that's correct
mels/013574.pt|i must grapple work with a twenty two months

mels/012321.pt|working space pizza and it's like that's i'm not
mels/030238.pt|good i'm glad i had a love story ready for when
mels/007675.pt|i was trying to i was brainstorming last night ideas and i
mels/011257.pt|it's going to be so we did not we didn't we
mels/004896.pt|the company and then the board of
mels/020797.pt|it's actually very hard for a
mels/007412.pt|as it's only a few months from where i lived and
mels/003189.pt|well the employees and basically said um
mels/004941.pt|you can see in after hours trading twitter stock has fallen off a cliff and i think on monday when markets open again this thing's going to crater
mels/000611.pt|so german selected really well i had a
mels/019755.pt|is on our shores we are little over a week away
mels/003540.pt|catch up so i wouldn't i wouldn't jump into
mels/012329.pt|so like for example they like there was one night where we had like
mels/016544.pt|wherever every year more money more prize more viewership it's something that's that's
mels/009491.pt|knowing that their value will just go up
mels/025697.pt|it's a world war one got started while 299 for
mels/008741.pt|anyway some of the other tweets they put in here
mels/030246.pt|set up on his kitchen counter my computer literally like he had a kitchen island
mels/005035.pt|would be like hey i had
mels/018588.pt|the xbox knows this is like their do or die moment and they're spending dummy money
mels/026604.pt|is wacky and fun don't mention other networks or competitive ip example this
mels/013498.pt|doing any kind of positive hard thing gives us
mels/008605.pt|he tweeted right here if our twitter bid succeeds we will
mels/006356.pt|it's like this it just can't be a normal level of gotcha it really needs to be a hundred
mels/005033.pt|you get like a hundred thousand likes
mels/030646.pt|and it's like me maybe one
mels/004368.pt|four hours and for me that's true because i saw a
mels/027112.pt|but anything else than charlie murray
mels/002144.pt|apple thank you for your great contribution you definitely know
mels/002607.pt|nobody has won today is insane
mels/000404.pt|it's a really slow game it takes
mels/010673.pt|is the balloons boss i've never done the bloons boss which is like you fight a boss in balloons
mels/016351.pt|little serious i want to give what i think might be the biggest fail the biggest actual literal fail i've ever given
mels/018855.pt|about it it only really applies if your complete unknown so
mels/002382.pt|tomorrow new map brand new map tomorrow
mels/007180.pt|so i messaged him again over a year ago when i saw some highlight clips from a tournament like a small tournament in
mels/018881.pt|we stressed about the kids worried about school I don't want to get a zero on a
mels/027545.pt|do you think they'll get back to these heights and more even though these were kind of
mels/010100.pt|if your first box if you use code pog hrock 120
mels/012146.pt|it's the good and everybody so anyway at one point i say something
mels/021844.pt|what i'm thinking okay so he's kind of terrible at titling
mels/029316.pt|the hyper fan i was a guy who'd put thousands of hours
mels/017404.pt|somebody had put an image of jake hurwitz from college humor just in there it's i think it's like it's if you search hrx it's somewhere in here
mels/027942.pt|this model that requires them to sell information on your trades to hedge
mels/014160.pt|incentives to to run a lot of ads get a lot of viewers sell a lot of subs that's
mels/030922.pt|the main reason i'm losing actually is the
mels/004312.pt|have to talk about today we
mels/014363.pt|in the united states and disrupt these guys but for now it's only these two and
mels/024462.pt|the new fragrance that says subway has so much new it didn't fit in their last hat so they bought time in
mels/014556.pt|with a job that i'm focused on but
mels/012077.pt|and there's not that much to do it's
mels/005593.pt|we had some pizza here that the whole
mels/011690.pt|it'll be the guy where everyone else is having fun and i'm like yeah we're not in space i'm not
mels/019001.pt|which she as part of her storyline joined this is her as a child wow look at
mels/012247.pt|so i'm off doing other things me and
mels/028916.pt|well visibly drunk they were they were they
mels/021313.pt|on an average night that means
mels/001065.pt|a little bit do cause i was insulted it's
mels/021643.pt|oh my god it would have broken the
mels/005825.pt|what's it like that like he's got a bunch of stuff like it wasn't i
mels/026807.pt|is growing like crazy it's funny that apple made this whole thing about privacy and like it's all about privacy but they just created their own ad business which is blowing up growing like crazy and they're using all the data themselves but they've blocked facebook out so tim cook just sort of kicked
mels/022245.pt|do not create beautiful reminiscing looks at the family's past they just play temple run let's see
mels/028150.pt|and that boring company had like 70 million
mels/022654.pt|sure you can buy yourself the extra time you need to finish the final level julian i've
mels/014574.pt|the go like you know like right now someone like
mels/002204.pt|i never even heard of facebook all right
mels/003150.pt|i know who are going through some really tough times they're reporting earnings soon
mels/018069.pt|i think i'm learning so much about how the
mels/008765.pt|like there's bots for sure but it's not like
mels/021557.pt|it's going to be like a scam on wall street bets i mean people are so hungry for more of this they're going to jump on anything
mels/023964.pt|well the only fans and what my thoughts are i'm
mels/010933.pt|these blaster so there's a lot there's a lot
mels/027478.pt|elon musk has purchased twitter for
mels/027570.pt|with all that brewing i think twitter
mels/005409.pt|so it's got me thinking about you know what i can learn anyway
mels/027825.pt|last year now it's at twelve dollars but
mels/029757.pt|so everyone worldwide can hate leffen
mels/017551.pt|when steve jobs released the iphone your
mels/001049.pt|isn't that wild like i'm sure all the
mels/003305.pt|it's a recession but i have a win for you i have a win we are not in a recession
mels/016320.pt|about a mcdonald's mascot not the one you're thinking of the moon one that we talked about mac tonight now
mels/011888.pt|isn't that day on everyone else showed up and of course
mels/022888.pt|the background just so they can break
mels/018624.pt|in all the investors were like whoa you're spending two billion dollars on
mels/028090.pt|his keynote they decided to start making their own phone which led to the iphone
mels/014314.pt|if the the good features i like youtube but he can't leave he cannot switch over because twitch prime money was such a big chunk of his income that you can't keep up with it so it's a nuclear bomb it's very powerful and
mels/009837.pt|and uh they're still not they're not
mels/017483.pt|i think it is a way within the system to
mels/018325.pt|everything because right now if you're a
mels/000741.pt|talk about the future and and i just i tell
mels/004261.pt|you can withdraw it because right until now fortnite
mels/031111.pt|erin better at streaming he got good at bits he got funnier
mels/018771.pt|they're gonna announce something about god of war
mels/026067.pt|and from a small share to now they are literally
mels/008960.pt|just speaking as a corporate lawyer these agreements typically have a termination fee and other related penalties
mels/019740.pt|was our bars i thought our only defense
mels/005366.pt|if he's like yes he's like nodding yes he's
mels/018818.pt|if things don't hold up about it and it is
mels/007420.pt|and because you know that none was trying to act out of that let's see
mels/002504.pt|the coffee shops and like read the documents in the back and start to piece
mels/026161.pt|we are still thriving and there was a leak this week that proves that blizzard has exactly what it takes to take back the crown and that's why my win this week is
mels/023981.pt|the money they are not stupid okay i
mels/017651.pt|they are temples to the brand and
mels/028275.pt|or thing and it's like all fours except for one guy
mels/002933.pt|it was fine it was not it
mels/011117.pt|oh no lie i kind of was like
mels/025633.pt|the money without giving up any ground to the competitor
mels/027720.pt|do you know what I'm saying
mels/024213.pt|if just did harry potter for the love of
mels/016511.pt|very little time on each one so we can make random decisions about the future of our lives and that way we can all end up like this
mels/022006.pt|and then the idea is that it hits the
mels/030817.pt|cause i didn't want to be much
mels/022490.pt|these corporations but they can do a little
mels/027860.pt|i mean there's only one coin that i'm buying the dip
mels/022244.pt|my experience kids locked away from a family event on
mels/013786.pt|we don't know where it came from we don't know who made it just buy it
mels/004913.pt|for a company it's not worth that much so if somebody's
mels/010176.pt|the twitch version of jackass i
mels/003733.pt|the are scared of that they try to i think i think they want us to be apathetic because then we don't do anything
mels/016771.pt|we're having the highest deaths ever so we're
mels/003703.pt|a but like and like there's no way we can enforce
mels/023016.pt|of course they knew it would get caught the second it went up
mels/007119.pt|oh speaking of the vaccine on that subject i was on my flight back
mels/017842.pt|they had a they have a free if the game
mels/024128.pt|now before we go to the future i want to take you on a journey through my past let's take a look at some of the odd jobs i've done over the years
mels/008689.pt|i think bloomberg business by matt levine he's a good writer and
mels/009493.pt|team they call league of legends the
mels/009158.pt|it ranks it based on how long it's been up
mels/030904.pt|if the people i like wits and
mels/015995.pt|well it's a pretty good command in
mels/014326.pt|the office they had everyone else's
mels/018003.pt|it's others you know that's the
mels/031950.pt|the next day at school or i think
mels/007002.pt|but i also got people coming up to me and handing me things and one guy when i was at the when i was
mels/028139.pt|because they weren't public in time and the financial forecast is much much darker than they originally promised they still have income they don't actually make money because they spend
mels/017925.pt|and now you're like a lifelong consumer of marvel content once you've watched
mels/000967.pt|i could have a crazy time and i was like bro i know you've seen the hangover i'm i'm
mels/023600.pt|okay not exactly a food bank it's a stolen
mels/023521.pt|so if you're making a gazillion cars you can use large factories to lower
mels/024302.pt|yeah i mean it turned out great i
mels/003315.pt|and we are not headed for negative
mels/021022.pt|yeah i think it's funny and
mels/024832.pt|the hero is something you can pull that can go up to five stars but also all of their items and weapons can be pulled that go up to five stars so every time you play this game there is an infinite different number of directions that you can be
mels/024933.pt|in the game oh no oh no and that's that's an audience of game developers listening to a game
mels/032173.pt|i let it ride i double up again on the field i say let it ride though and i don't give him his chip back
mels/017663.pt|all day to test the experience
mels/004789.pt|there was no misunderstanding especially because he openly waived his right to any deeper diligence before signing a written contract agreement that guaranteed that he would purchase twitter at
mels/024420.pt|for decades now billboards are pretty much like a
mels/005011.pt|we will see it remains to be seen
mels/000115.pt|well there'll be sushi at your wedding i am vegan and that is the only fancy food i eat well there wasn't
mels/017824.pt|yeah this is it look at this
mels/028178.pt|so i'm interested and i will be following up on this story of face clan's possible implosion but let's just
mels/027372.pt|speaking of learning and laughing let's get to the wins and fails starting off
mels/015021.pt|let's talk about this netflix okay

mels/027976.pt|all of its western assets including tomb raider deus ex for like fire sale prices of
mels/024960.pt|it's the world now this is a mini
mels/007138.pt|or two seats from me i

mels/011315.pt|twelve grand magically disappears when you said
mels/021085.pt|worried about marketing from watching it from a distance
mels/008042.pt|and then i would say come on guys be nice and then the next time they'd be like wow he's a genius and when i got a really simple one right
mels/010116.pt|a little bit it should sound good like it sounds like you should hear my voice
mels/020295.pt|and i think making this a little
mels/002869.pt|the judge ruled that not only will the court case take place in september but it will be five days she said specifically the court case will last five days that's it we will handle this you will make arguments
mels/010526.pt|put pressure on the stream right i understand that
mels/011059.pt|so it's like i couldn't i
mels/029162.pt|and eventually i could get like i could get past erica i got so good i
mels/004759.pt|he was not exhibiting the telltale signs of a person about to go through with a deal in fact he was doing the opposite he was
mels/024794.pt|a false heuristic in your brain that the odds of it are higher than they actually are you are more likely to think it's possible when you see other people getting it let me give you a direct quote here this is a direct quote again from a game developer that makes mobile games do not tell your players that the majority of people do not spend money that is
mels/025588.pt|i can't wait to play this that was
mels/023514.pt|buying this car the answer is a
mels/003035.pt|as like it was like very very quick everyone in the theater like had the same thought and it was a mass panic and that was that was really interesting to me was how quickly everyone went from like
mels/001256.pt|the country but for english speaking i mean
mels/020147.pt|a better than average commercial this is not bad at all
mels/031215.pt|and i uh i remember i had a pretty funny
mels/011827.pt|is from the future it also like reminds bitcoin on your
mels/001078.pt|is blow my that's crazy too early you know he'll start talking about valorent and
mels/008317.pt|cause the quarterly date hasn't come out yet i
mels/012176.pt|with the that so i pop a quick nap so i
mels/010446.pt|what happening but for real same though i appreciate that good energy i've been
mels/028979.pt|or gummy bear after gummy bear
mels/025889.pt|more of a forward thinker and less of a
mels/002756.pt|i guess pay the musician now contact pay the musician
mels/008532.pt|if they make like chicken fingers
mels/030350.pt|and i really liked her and uh finally
mels/011600.pt|where it was in the timeline like i didn't need that to know where it
mels/002363.pt|in flies when i'm watching thanks for all the great moments and content these past
mels/012365.pt|and tell the bartender a code but the thing about the bartender
mels/022872.pt|it it could not have kicked off in a more perfect way the apple versus epic lawsuit was held
mels/000109.pt|we talk a good amount but i didn't know
mels/022215.pt|that makes you cry to me i'll always prefer to an ad that tries to make you cry by shock value because here's the deal an ad is at most a minute long
mels/002770.pt|with them today but they're interesting so we can jump into them in just a second i'm
mels/029750.pt|that's what i want to know yeah my assumption is like
mels/012421.pt|as the party and he starts fighting rey and they're
mels/021731.pt|hooks you in the switch into the taglines good well contained
mels/024907.pt|two things it's very easy to create a loop where they're hooked very quickly next they have a bunch of fallacies now i
mels/008093.pt|at appropriate amount for you know if someone really cared about the cause centuries of of slavery i don't think there is a number to be honest nothing will really fix it but you know
mels/005339.pt|well anyway it was it was very very funny and
mels/011390.pt|if thousand dollars from me because i am about five to six thousand dollars poorer than i was on friday and i'm
mels/021718.pt|but i can tell you from a marketing
mels/026187.pt|i thought it was an amazing show it was very
mels/025660.pt|so i looked into it there was set up to where only the founder and creator of squid coin was able to sell it was so i looked into it it was set up to where only the founder and creator of
mels/009805.pt|of money for bread no no no they're they're not experiencing that and the
mels/019977.pt|make great movies but they hired the talent from pixar to run disney animation there's pretty much no doubt in my mind that frozen would not have been created if they hadn't bought pixar pixar changed the whole culture of disney and ended up pleasing to the massive
mels/014542.pt|not today but for his first
mels/010507.pt|at the way more heart and
mels/000756.pt|and i think that's yeah other than losing a combined oh so anyway yeah we we combined lost enough money to pay for the sweet and more so they were happy this week guys were happy
mels/013476.pt|the sure of tom hardy saying he's a millionaire
mels/029659.pt|and i kind of i was like yeah that that makes sense bro
mels/003572.pt|but i do like to be informed i think i'm a realist is cliche
mels/014722.pt|what do you mean you don't know me
mels/019903.pt|now number one it's time for number one of the top
mels/024925.pt|i want to show you one of the scariest quotes from again let's go whaling and
mels/001786.pt|oh no that's not it let's see what our next video is
mels/004644.pt|no i i really am not interested but thank you for your time and i hang up
mels/018708.pt|crazy how big microsoft is dude
mels/031369.pt|broke child compared to what he is now making
mels/007238.pt|incredible posture set up headphones on his head focused big jug of water and he's just worried that it's going to distract he's worried that it would distract him or throw
mels/008551.pt|arguments the first two are really pretty dumb
mels/008223.pt|and it means that there's just no shot in hell that he can be re-elected and that
mels/027647.pt|if the biggest take on this whole situation is not that you know i don't
mels/030961.pt|hello everyone i am not mature enough to keep you all
mels/004679.pt|i want like let's say let's say
mels/019447.pt|i have so many ads in
mels/018779.pt|bare knuckle brawl i think it's going to be one of the greatest console wars now the real winner of course chat is the nvidia
mels/025528.pt|that sony has set aside and and absolutely staggering for them 13 to
mels/004669.pt|the the minions rise of gru i didn't see it
mels/017341.pt|i have worked for amazon at some point including myself by the way i have
mels/003078.pt|i've noticed that even though i'm doing the same type of updates i'm getting more comments like hey man this is really depressing i'm getting a lot more comments on my youtube they're like hey wow
mels/030257.pt|there's like nothing in it like so i'm like going under the
mels/018784.pt|pretty series card and play games the way they're meant to be played so hopefully that helped you guys
mels/025692.pt|like he's some kind of artiste you're
mels/027354.pt|we used to think about a way
mels/030178.pt|i won but then this is where i lost and this is where this is where ludwig
mels/015390.pt|if your max other streamers were doing better
mels/006137.pt|what did you link me with your sub
mels/016723.pt|at a fight which means remote work stuff is here to stay at least for some portion of the public permanently there's just no way they are going to they're going to be kicking and screaming back to the office because of how much additional time they receive with their family friends kids etc and so
mels/014449.pt|a little bit safer on youtube youtube just
mels/002146.pt|welcome hello it's not always so hostile it's not always so hostile it's the hitman
mels/015221.pt|and it's also why if you're if you're someone who's
mels/010429.pt|right i have my family i have ari's family and i have three to
mels/007079.pt|i didn't want to come off
mels/016182.pt|as success you gotta invest in success you
mels/019584.pt|in one thing so not only do you know what they do they get you cash now but you know how to call them so like everything you need who they are what they do and how to contact them is in their jingle and the
mels/001409.pt|well join up if you're not expecting to
mels/003675.pt|i kind of snowballs and that's the real problem that i have is like er is just
mels/024438.pt|cool use of a billboard it
mels/014123.pt|so it turns out again in the post drake era in the post
mels/002892.pt|when he does so normally billionaires don't
mels/025941.pt|i totally no it's an amazing
mels/005724.pt|that he bought for will quote for will neff he said for
mels/021184.pt|let me be honest with you zoomers are
mels/009149.pt|with such vigor is it just because he says he likes rick
mels/008996.pt|get aaron i love i can't i can't
mels/024239.pt|i'm going to say i'm gonna say it i'm gonna say i
mels/000467.pt|you know i have an extra bed because i'm like
mels/009506.pt|god but maybe it's just me but if a guy is named yasuo
mels/014018.pt|pull out there was like there was less than 20 bundles i think
mels/024039.pt|a big release of a soda drink soda drink a new coke okay and it was
mels/023571.pt|it's a great way to think about marketing in general and i hope that this breakdown
mels/022838.pt|and subsequently lost my job we looked
mels/018595.pt|they don't have to work anymore everyone
mels/015991.pt|fifty bucks a month i am getting like
mels/026842.pt|well actually pretty great pretty solid for any
mels/001363.pt|the first letter of your first name and if i can guess it if i can guess it
mels/000403.pt|we are playing pie gal and we're winning it
mels/019597.pt|my entire life the best part of waking up is folders in
mels/003337.pt|but right now there is something and people that have taken the
mels/027174.pt|i love that that's actually a good idea how about us millennials anyone
mels/020568.pt|if you committed fraud on me i hate you i'll never trust you again that's an
mels/019533.pt|that's almost better because it's quick that's quick and memorable i think the first one's a better
mels/030871.pt|of league the intelligent genius veteran of league of legends but also not old the one challenge the one monkey wrench thrown into this machine is that i must do it with my trusty sidekick who shows up drunk and late cutie cinderella
mels/007271.pt|second place breakout performance far exceeding his seed
mels/026687.pt|games from twitch now again this is this is
mels/022228.pt|fuck are we doing out here why
mels/009072.pt|hold up hold up hold up hold up hello
mels/009419.pt|his keyboard soraka can still die easy clap
mels/005863.pt|i want to get time i had a good time i had good conversations
mels/030910.pt|i'm not picky that is crazy he could give a tesla as a wedding gift true could and should not
mels/020526.pt|was probably means more crunch i feel bad
mels/003725.pt|by cutting back on private label and they're doing it very i mean they're doing way less
mels/027243.pt|can learn from and even improve on i don't think anyone who is serious about it will say that the ui i don't think any
mels/028367.pt|what the goal in this meeting
mels/016850.pt|to solve things that humans were able to do but slowly or not able to do at all extremely quickly and at
mels/025426.pt|famous streamer says are you seeing this
mels/009337.pt|is that i get to have two bars
mels/012311.pt|everything i mean the food was really cool because oh i didn't show you
mels/012868.pt|and a good senior year so that's what i brought my
mels/030598.pt|at the bottom scores i'm banning
mels/011072.pt|yeah i can hear you okay sick nice nice nice
mels/009105.pt|talking about finish the book what you have
mels/019010.pt|like immediately like when i first
mels/028193.pt|or whatever and there was so much snow on the roof that the it was like a collapse risk and
mels/011978.pt|is either like you know larpers or families they want
mels/001503.pt|whether you're doing makes any sense
mels/030088.pt|you don't understand how long i've been hauling
mels/031729.pt|we're gonna look at dewey's page first and then i'm gonna learn about actually sorry uh before i even go on
mels/010265.pt|as a cooking show at the same time
mels/008211.pt|what argument that'll convince you i think it is very
mels/015870.pt|make more sense than paying for them all separately like making cable again no that won't make sense because no one
mels/010362.pt|i can't really i can't talk about that because i play balloons it's not like there's a certain level of class that i'm like i need to hold to
mels/016485.pt|the wall street and the document said the following
mels/016518.pt|and that is the rise of
mels/015669.pt|movies people want to watch and so as long as you have amazing content and also they've proven they can do it with like loki and
mels/007763.pt|well i went live i'm literally pantsless i'm
mels/011583.pt|good luck i hope you get it godspeed don't have to call
mels/011154.pt|i don't do this god damn it we gotta play fall guys or what
mels/021388.pt|at normal about gamestop what was not normal about gamestop what was not normal about gamestop
mels/021300.pt|creators of the at the top point one
mels/014618.pt|it's been growing so there's probably groups of
mels/000269.pt|we all make money everyone's having good we
mels/016304.pt|feels without giving a w to the best in the business jeff bezos and amazon baby okay
mels/021488.pt|is dollars even if it's here why don't the hedge funds just hold on so here's the deal
mels/002277.pt|but it's not unreasonable if you're a successful rapper or musical artist and your career was starting to fade faking your own death and staying off the grid five 10 years
mels/031735.pt|many characters is no no enemy characters no
mels/020057.pt|two billion dollars right now the estimate i've heard is that youtube
mels/002219.pt|you're basically said like so if
mels/016653.pt|actually the biggest company after 10 years ever
mels/014789.pt|kind of understands what a freelancer or side
mels/001540.pt|three questions everyone knows that uh who was it was
mels/026494.pt|reach an agreement with any of the rights holders involved in the creation
mels/006518.pt|and it could become extremely high
mels/003688.pt|and then enforce it and right there from then
mels/024007.pt|just to pay out hundreds of millions of dollars to craters every month goes through a few big banks and the big banks are scared of being associated with any illegal activity and the big banks are also run by in general
mels/007961.pt|i like to shout them out
mels/006396.pt|that take a chance on them you know that give give them the opportunity to succeed even when they're starting from the bottom and that's why i want to give another win to the company bolt
mels/012539.pt|and or whatever and when she would tap it it
mels/011742.pt|so i'm talking to jenny and mark and
mels/014608.pt|if the on specific generally youtube has a lower
mels/027926.pt|of laying people off with dignity when you're a manager an executive you have
mels/010857.pt|and that guy actually i do think yasuo players secretly think
mels/029383.pt|the champion by heart i know league in and out and then they're talking about current events and world stuff and not even like deep lore of elon musk just like stuff in the news about elon musk and i go yeah yeah
mels/003087.pt|what i was thinking was okay
mels/020666.pt|old episodes of video game high school for six hours straight every day monday
mels/028030.pt|as which is leading to uh
mels/002087.pt|who dad i will not be seeing a
mels/030243.pt|going to be kind of sad kind of lonely everyone's going home to see their family what am i
mels/012973.pt|to teachers they yell at teachers they blame teachers for
mels/027883.pt|it's like clearing the underbrush out
mels/022337.pt|it's like day nine would just go dead silent and pure green with no explanation and so for seven days people started wondering what the
mels/014978.pt|it but they all have different goals they
mels/027388.pt|it's just the beginning they also
mels/008554.pt|this is just part of normal business
mels/012579.pt|i still haven't gone through them all
mels/018474.pt|but i'd give the edge to sony
mels/018591.pt|i do i mean on pc it'll be on pc and
mels/023892.pt|this tournament if it had been bad
mels/021740.pt|it's like you can like it ironically and you could like it
mels/020531.pt|in chug away this game until it's fixed i mean it's
mels/016510.pt|am on one we'll do a bunch and spend
mels/004317.pt|at the end so we got a lot we got a lot we got a lot
mels/019665.pt|i recorded it on my phone
mels/024509.pt|at discount price apple of course freaked
mels/026809.pt|for companies are so big five companies basically that only they can really compete with each other smaller companies have a hard time
mels/018585.pt|so i would say this is a very important generation this is like the most important and i think microsoft clearly realizes
mels/031664.pt|but the crazy thing is the people watching league were getting hyped they were getting torqued they were
mels/004328.pt|add that i'll never said that tom holland
mels/029003.pt|i would beat your ass dude
mels/001128.pt|if they're not even hiding it like i wish
mels/020908.pt|i stand for because it makes you do the wrong thing but i'm happy about it i made 12 grand today off of my neo stock
mels/006332.pt|well i'm not ignoring your perspective
mels/015587.pt|and now as of a few months ago roku bought the entire quibby library
mels/027486.pt|what twitter so i got twitter and i got this is
mels/003691.pt|as if and like there's no chance because that's
mels/029108.pt|extremely broke trying to make esports jobs work had no money and i started
mels/029584.pt|it so it was just cool
mels/009211.pt|have played for 14 hours a day for the last
mels/029061.pt|from the theater so then i have to just sit there
mels/002323.pt|we have a guest and so i'm
mels/017672.pt|well designed the ipod this is
mels/013702.pt|celebrities have a real power on twitter
mels/014758.pt|he reached out to me i think we started talking and then
mels/016950.pt|people hopefully you can follow nancy pelosi
mels/000201.pt|the table so he's always the villain
mels/016775.pt|there were people that are age 65 and
mels/011063.pt|as i should oh come on man
mels/023601.pt|when mcdonald's we can't just have every person who's food insecure sees a mcdonald's
mels/022507.pt|it furthers my brand perception of burger king as having gross food
mels/011862.pt|have a something different happening like there's always there's like a there's a meteor shower or another ship
mels/008719.pt|exactly he would have to prove not only
mels/020273.pt|i'm pretty sure this this came out in the summer
mels/027890.pt|if you have to pay online are almost equaling
mels/018656.pt|today is marketing monday if you guys don't know my full-time job for the past four years now for three years has been global
mels/002407.pt|the can sort of put my pst language into esd
mels/025578.pt|i don't want to just roast mark zuckerberg here i also want to roast deb a little bit
mels/019941.pt|prior to the launch of the xbox
mels/031349.pt|required some sort of thing and uh she's
mels/026131.pt|and it's a guy who's been
mels/026804.pt|the crash this is primarily because of apple
mels/023300.pt|but coke's response which was yeah
mels/025365.pt|and who else are you gonna
mels/004763.pt|purchasing her a horse in exchange for an erotic massage on his jet
mels/010527.pt|ask somebody on stream things get
mels/028900.pt|to this party i realize i'm feeling bad i need to go to the bathroom and i tell diego that i need to go to the bathroom and the bathroom maybe this is later
mels/006557.pt|how the bn part and not the pl part
mels/022372.pt|and they had the confidence not to force in a can of red bull at any moment there was one by the computer that
mels/031315.pt|good thing is a sting operation the second i try to leave the door
mels/021853.pt|at of the actual serious part
mels/020558.pt|i think that's fair to say now i took no man's sky down because it got fixed if this game gets fixed i'll take it down but right now at launch based on what they said for eight years and what we got especially console players it's the most
mels/011256.pt|it'd be interesting is because they force them
mels/003606.pt|why and i have basically two jobs that are doing really well
mels/001046.pt|you should be looking your text
mels/001399.pt|in the trivia question and if they get it right i'll give
mels/013120.pt|at indian food for dinner it was really
mels/016948.pt|which is a great way to just practice you can also follow people
mels/024254.pt|let me tell you why you're here it is the world of luxury that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth we just want to get our
mels/002391.pt|at the second it comes out so that we are legitimately unspoiled and we can come
mels/000992.pt|i think korea does it this way
mels/024536.pt|points were shot down they were not
mels/026018.pt|so yesterday was public domain day
mels/019382.pt|or older brands so we we kept releasing new brands
mels/016276.pt|if there is one thing we love it's promises we don't care if
mels/010280.pt|one with the headphone cord oh
mels/007479.pt|if she thinks the bacon and eggs were going to be bad like
mels/021677.pt|it's decent ratings where's the cringe
mels/008848.pt|because they don't want to be locked into that and then get proven wrong
mels/003590.pt|whoa a penny in his penny videos it's just like that you get it software boom over
mels/003629.pt|sounds like it's just incredibly expensive for that reason
mels/023674.pt|i got ghosted to be honest they probably got ghosted uber driver said hey sweetie but i heard
mels/030959.pt|the spirit you're right it is actually about
mels/012979.pt|like overworked teachers and so it's like or probably even
mels/022641.pt|the team this has been a
mels/019767.pt|what will buy it for a short period of time essentially hype what it is is lying
mels/024664.pt|it's easy access to debt and the interest payments are very low once banks start to

mels/007368.pt|that if you have a clip even link if anyone
mels/024881.pt|they would have said before that okay so people once they
mels/008446.pt|so uninterested i would literally run the wrong way all the time like i would have no i would have no concept of what team i was on what the goal what what you know where we're going and i would
mels/025935.pt|the game and in fact are trying to pivot
mels/012737.pt|it always gives you reward so you work hard in wow or anything
mels/028533.pt|and i'm just going everyone i call
mels/015757.pt|are not staying how big important is the american
mels/004965.pt|has legally changed her name to confirm
mels/006827.pt|you should actually and you might be intimidated by starcraft just don't play the multiplayer literally
mels/032231.pt|at the way when he was walking back
mels/008418.pt|if the that we'll see how that goes
mels/024432.pt|it set up to where the main walkway angle is where you see it most beautifully so there was a good one
mels/006779.pt|was because she had sent me a a card and so i had said
mels/013799.pt|but i think they think the rat is controlling this but it looks like the rat is just
mels/017163.pt|mount we could sell and so uh
mels/014823.pt|there's there's articles about it and then they say this is just the beginning and then let's get one more article here this one right here should be perfect uh
mels/005711.pt|like playing with them and so
mels/027894.pt|alice for change that is the upside in the
mels/003523.pt|yeah yeah i think there's just a long history of everybody thinking they live in the end of times everybody thinking that their unique problems were
mels/019288.pt|what what is the early demand looking like Afghanistan area more excited for the
mels/005199.pt|i listen here's the only thing is i don't think i would do it again because
mels/008572.pt|obviously we all know twitter has bots
mels/027619.pt|when he's battery makers are major supply specials
mels/022840.pt|the second the deal completes this happens let's pull it up and get rid of my black boxes it goes from this to this because this thing called broadband comes out and people don't want to pay by the hour so all of this aol
mels/031155.pt|like i i oh my god i'm so like you look
mels/003660.pt|have i done this okay i think i could tell you
mels/022977.pt|fifty billion dollars just in a war chest and that's more than epics ever made
mels/010465.pt|i know back in the day i was so pro
mels/022668.pt|late april fools for that year
mels/006830.pt|if the fun thing to do i swear to god if you like
mels/010396.pt|they're trying to silence me and you know what i will let them because i have no choice because internet in america is a
mels/023498.pt|if the brand they lose their perceived value and they can't charge as high prices
mels/029605.pt|there are no one if you're not even if you're
mels/006923.pt|if that's the case so i already have a shirt a good marketing monday shirt
mels/013768.pt|well the sexual assault lawsuits anymore
mels/006090.pt|is pop offer was about to pop off on him
mels/001822.pt|about it for a while because i used to read
mels/002349.pt|if you need a video of me wishing you
mels/006195.pt|have camera i was gonna i was gonna
mels/017701.pt|when people and 90 percent of them said they
mels/010400.pt|with the country where the government
mels/017857.pt|companies in general are so bad at this part of it and the ones you've seen that have thrived are really good at it
mels/012071.pt|would make jokes about how like politics was tearing our our marriage apart
mels/027470.pt|each year due to global warming and why climate crisis reform has been completely
mels/003890.pt|at this and i think if he runs i
mels/008216.pt|is that i disagree with and they are just bad at
mels/027522.pt|fuck are these people working on i've always
mels/009356.pt|it got a great video the video of me responding to that guy
mels/015740.pt|you will want to watch like like south park or the boys or ted
mels/025013.pt|i look this up if you say pokemon you're happy if you say game freak you are almost certainly mad no one has ever said good job game freak if they say
mels/028735.pt|how it's actually was two tickets it was two tickets it was two tickets
mels/010665.pt|and you can't always be pure dj but i played last night with
mels/020180.pt|be smiling that was my one my one concern was why they had to be smiling but
mels/022345.pt|with twitter they spent no money they they literally
mels/023363.pt|marketing related at all but i was browsing
mels/027479.pt|billion dollars and we've got all of the takes in the world about it in fact i think it has created even faster
mels/020326.pt|one and ludwig obviously is a commanding
mels/006768.pt|it's not a joke this is not a joke this is not a
mels/016940.pt|check my stocks um without that
mels/025411.pt|are playing i don't know what this is a futuristic orc fighter they're playing lord of the
mels/012475.pt|in fully betrayed the crew we don't get punished at all in fact the actors are like
mels/024752.pt|the beautiful gorgeous world we see here of
mels/019940.pt|why microsoft for a mere 30 million dollars
mels/015084.pt|we're getting both in one and they left netflix and
mels/015163.pt|now i'm not sure how many of
mels/006733.pt|outside of smash events i don't sign
mels/004253.pt|it has not been met with
mels/016306.pt|this new stat number one in the business baby most injuries per employee four times higher than other warehouses in america if you
mels/026142.pt|cause i looked at what this guy did this guy
mels/031945.pt|the bus driver had like kidnapped a bunch of kids and all the kids were like writing messages in the windows you
mels/007460.pt|what what odds would you give it though like
mels/021926.pt|take money from my real life i had to lose money on twitch i lost money for the first six months i think
mels/021190.pt|exactly where i am this is the largest
mels/002431.pt|teen months and x aquatics name
mels/024519.pt|the judge said was and this is really good
mels/017521.pt|today is a little bit similar to that
mels/003719.pt|well the selection and it says a midweek sales but it's not it's not this is actually a
mels/001989.pt|want to do it so there's no
mels/031201.pt|erase race versus insanely old boomer
mels/027010.pt|it would just rate is really highly so i'm interested if it was
mels/008530.pt|it's guaranteed guaranteed huge profit but if you're not that judge then it's pretty risky i mean no one knows exactly
mels/006652.pt|i think we got some funny stuff and some good stuff and i
mels/025933.pt|because these are two games that launched and haven't done that well on blizzard's side they
mels/004529.pt|what are the most consistent in saying preaching caution and safety and
mels/016291.pt|with his profile is all like wordle
mels/027290.pt|we think about it here's the real question right
mels/012512.pt|oh important though is you have to buy the room the room is
mels/018359.pt|is interesting because it usually means that you are not happy with the company the second an employee comes into his office and asks for a raise
mels/007272.pt|listen if he gets a big boy sponsor who's
mels/030145.pt|if the on stream for two weeks straight yeah
mels/020917.pt|in heartbreak imo if you're passionate about it so
mels/031544.pt|then that happens now to explain what happens there this unit is called the reaver it's one of the most expensive
mels/026825.pt|everyone tunes in everyone cares and
mels/000098.pt|if the two months hey big i love this stream so
mels/008504.pt|musk is backed out but he he's he's not like
mels/030639.pt|at the one fact i remember was that the largest river in russia was lake baikal i remember that clearly because there was a big map of russia a big zoom in
mels/011529.pt|on youtube oh maybe so mad
mels/032122.pt|of streamers we have ludwig give it up for
mels/005438.pt|with a marketing manager for me to say no so i took
mels/024989.pt|so i'm noticing california it's uber which is funny that we quote unquote hate uber even though like there was a chance to finally make them pay their workers and they just spent a little money and
mels/005321.pt|ludwig based event but it was because jarvis johnson
mels/000284.pt|your rooms than we know what to do with
mels/018692.pt|and they didn't want that and so they
mels/028665.pt|with a bag of diamonds i dump it on his
mels/020248.pt|is he has a lot of positive associations so basically
mels/023584.pt|it's helped this to me is a fascinating
mels/026195.pt|i'm just being real here i didn't really
mels/017787.pt|at the key cultural moments around his emote
mels/002786.pt|and i'll be right back brb
mels/005568.pt|wait for the window so the guy didn't get in
mels/014197.pt|but gaming is not bigger than youtube gaming live facebook numbers are generally
mels/001810.pt|so people could know i was doing it and
mels/002619.pt|on your side and i've already bumped you
mels/015554.pt|is sort of it feels like it feels like apple executives think of themselves as cool they want to be cool they
mels/008762.pt|like whoa these spam bots though i don't
mels/004721.pt|it up a quincy plushie any minute now
mels/025061.pt|at the word despicable things convincing mothers in developing countries they should use nestle formula for their baby rather than breast milk like they shouldn't they shouldn't feed their own baby they should use nestle formula and try to make that they actually run like pr campaigns to make it seem like it's
mels/028536.pt|it's a place called tax ninja dude it was and i emailed tax ninja and i remember i didn't know what to say
mels/005838.pt|there had been a recent clip a funny
mels/026379.pt|it's competitors so them investing in the purchase and post-purchase areas of the clock have generated outside rewards another area is that all
mels/002213.pt|recession for all of our companies that
mels/017968.pt|on sunday because i literally did
mels/024686.pt|x come at the door and they come knocking
mels/011456.pt|i am not a big simple plan fan i don't
mels/001001.pt|like parades in the street it
mels/020719.pt|if the thread on the importance of fighting misinformation about what good data is about what
mels/017401.pt|as meeting and that's fine okay it's popular clip
mels/014536.pt|tune in tomorrow when i have
mels/011681.pt|the type of nerd that i am but i am not like a larping nerd i'm not like i never did
mels/016177.pt|you're you're saving money every step sold my dog for tickets to this marketing monday hopefully it's worth it you sold your dog for tickets
mels/009939.pt|like it is it is worthy of laughing at because it is it is cringe
mels/008313.pt|we can finally be classified as being in a recession are you are you excited for it are you like waiting with foam fingers
mels/031292.pt|well and i was like just like dude
mels/012339.pt|at the forks like they're just
mels/006987.pt|i but i also have um
mels/024173.pt|i lupo and tim both cashed out it was
mels/009681.pt|it's a little bit than i am currently
mels/027704.pt|will pay the fee for you it covers literally everything overall I'm really
mels/028523.pt|it's like hey boss i gotta go home i i
mels/001066.pt|hey pop quiz totally unrelated question how much do you like when i give thumbs up what's your status on that like totally unrelated question i just want to know if that's a thing that is
mels/004315.pt|we got a special guest appearance for a
mels/012154.pt|the room on screen and kills
mels/001131.pt|i put this on and pretend i have friends which
mels/028195.pt|i don't want to be in new jersey i can't
mels/025095.pt|as one of the lowest net promoter scores
mels/030929.pt|is fine it seems fine and when i was there after i realized
mels/018830.pt|it's not involved in his journey at all what I would really like if
mels/006003.pt|of your sets i thought you were like the rank seven fox in australia or something
mels/029417.pt|but that guy had a good rapport and
mels/029912.pt|i'm in the middle of it i'm in the middle of it he's getting if they just
mels/004968.pt|the the horse hush payment disclosure
mels/010635.pt|i would have thrown a little bit of spice a
mels/022886.pt|but that wasn't even a kid they paid a lot of money for that
mels/024949.pt|at the beginning of the way these tricks are being deployed across all games and once they catch you
mels/028894.pt|after this night we really never really hit it off if you could believe it after this that it was kind of awkward when i ran into her at all the
mels/003642.pt|listen the thing i hate the most about
mels/015646.pt|so again they are also in trouble peacock and paramount plus are both in deep trouble going on almost the full
mels/002263.pt|i can't believe i can't believe you did that
mels/017446.pt|well there was plenty of that happening at
mels/002345.pt|i have class in four hours i might as
mels/011363.pt|in a break will no longer be tolerated
mels/015175.pt|it's going into the next five years okay
mels/000542.pt|like you know i know he's doing incredibly well
mels/001085.pt|and speech yeah yeah yeah for sure uh
mels/018599.pt|right now the first wave of
mels/007089.pt|or character okay people generally don't like chic players and in the history of melee all the way back to the beginning at least like since ken you know since
mels/010994.pt|you get 16 free meals which is why it's
mels/006311.pt|if the a little uh tft gambling with
mels/025773.pt|has had possibly the best in this past week this would happen for blizzard okay number one diablo
mels/027196.pt|in the description below basically what public
mels/026096.pt|i have really shiny hair and shiny hair looks great on instagram that's a that's a response and then another one from guys were just about
mels/028194.pt|and so they had to cancel the tournament and everyone was like we already
mels/025966.pt|they would say hey we don't pay more than anyone else but
mels/019822.pt|in space stations roaming freighters crash
mels/027280.pt|ads for dark souls 2 that basically said how
mels/025969.pt|well of this at the end of the day blizzard has one thing that is keeping it going
mels/010344.pt|does that mean what does that mean i mean
mels/023115.pt|i slowly started to say hey we should probably eat less sugar and so a big one that's been happening is that people are afraid of high fructose corn syrup they'll look at the box and see if it
mels/005355.pt|so i was like i couldn't handle it all right
mels/022893.pt|i research both apple and epic put out
mels/015709.pt|is a challenge for me to keep all my business and personal expenses separate so thank you lily again for supporting marketing monday for sponsoring
mels/010535.pt|i think you're just you're just so busy
mels/018650.pt|if you think about where twitch was when it got
mels/026282.pt|if the three major sections on the clock
mels/018419.pt|i hated it that is the worst way to position your new service only fans watch out for it
mels/020939.pt|it's just not probable and it shouldn't be what you bank on the media tells you the stories of the overnight successes but that's all
mels/007762.pt|i forgot and i didn't notice
mels/015626.pt|wait legacy shows the office parks and rec but then their originals sucked
mels/011085.pt|it's always been quiet for as long as i've watched you it's always been quiet nah

mels/020965.pt|which one of these companies will be marked as
mels/015854.pt|yeah i think that's very interesting i didn't want to include it in this because it's kind of outside of the scope of the streaming wars but it's very interesting because netflix has started to see its competition not
mels/014833.pt|was or them buying them for themselves i'm
mels/014790.pt|am a lot and so i'm
mels/022928.pt|was losing loves cross-platform that's it none of

mels/024843.pt|we the company to make billions when we
mels/011394.pt|there is a five thousand dollar star

mels/005186.pt|hold up thank you skyler4204 for
mels/028602.pt|a got bought it got bought it got
mels/024450.pt|on this series but there's a new
mels/031381.pt|the boat we show up and this boat is like
mels/007256.pt|it's a joke it's a joke and it's funny and and
mels/019837.pt|it sounds like a bunch of weird um
mels/014433.pt|and so they're doing what they can
mels/000525.pt|like i guess it's the first half of claire
mels/027636.pt|the money to acquire where did
mels/001156.pt|it's been a constant supporter of the stream i super
mels/024571.pt|figure it out and we don't need to we can't figure it out
mels/027239.pt|the is elden ring designed well discourse
mels/016409.pt|it's not an economics class i'm not
mels/020564.pt|the the come out but they'll be fine
mels/022249.pt|i commercial i'm not ready for something as sad as a thai commercial
mels/005382.pt|people following the norms of society
mels/031980.pt|i want to hire you so in his words his own words i
mels/002687.pt|i don't mind let's say 50.

mels/030694.pt|and she's like did you hear did you hear
mels/025619.pt|but i will say it is now back as of yesterday afternoon check it out we're in the
mels/030173.pt|lot of things we could compete at we did a lot of physical challenges so one of them was a foot race which we have a video of
mels/004883.pt|basically behave and maybe not incorrectly that the rules do not apply to him that that rules that apply to other
mels/010286.pt|are dating i think that is what happened i have not seen the video but i'm under that impression so we're
mels/013297.pt|the best man he already told me
mels/003538.pt|interest rates have created an environment where it's unlikely house prices
mels/003724.pt|the the on that but on much larger things so they're trying to avoid getting completely broken up long
mels/009387.pt|it's like a two percent gain but you
mels/026162.pt|is blizzard for reportedly making a secret overwatch mobile game this is what they needed finally genius
mels/000318.pt|so we had a bunch of
mels/002396.pt|i guess lives in america now yeah he figured it out he got on the winning side here he got out right before the heat wave hit europe interesting interesting coincidence or is link
mels/026588.pt|i sit there and the second starts talking
mels/031761.pt|is this a show or is this
mels/027560.pt|with the company and there was a million shares or whatever they would print two million more that's the thing that's
mels/000706.pt|no else was doing it and i was going to be
mels/007143.pt|to get coving i don't want to get it i
mels/031493.pt|i i think even chess and i know
mels/023638.pt|first of all i'm pro the cause and second of all there is a benefit even if it's cringy of a lot of big
mels/000196.pt|he's the guy that had the skate fast eat ass bush did
mels/028640.pt|gotcha and at that point i go into full grind mode i immediately put all my work down i leave my desk
mels/029067.pt|and of course everyone always asks the
mels/009450.pt|it's mr p set it up for saudi arabia
mels/004367.pt|even the best photo i've seen in the last 24
mels/001687.pt|that you can imagine i mean legitimately
mels/014737.pt|there is no context everything is just a random bit into another random bit
mels/009473.pt|yeah that's that's how you win a
mels/003753.pt|we just do it without any consequence there's no
mels/009675.pt|i'm not going to play valorent
mels/020426.pt|can we get our first zero
mels/029900.pt|three corner and we're like calling an uber to
mels/028118.pt|be the first billion dollar esports company
mels/027584.pt|it's literally the same revenue as olive garden which is worth substantially less
mels/022991.pt|microtransactions and we're not getting a cut of that because back then the app store didn't care about that it was only for the initial download and they said we'll have to make sure
mels/000328.pt|and it's cool there's like elevators i
mels/023371.pt|the wrong and so a day later i tagged him in my first post i think in
mels/004355.pt|it actually did super well so
mels/003064.pt|we were like hustling you know and it's like that's my best man right there bro moment
mels/022629.pt|with the time so i had no

mels/029388.pt|it was like there was no chance i
mels/010724.pt|it's out of the irs's hands yet thankfully thank god not in the hands of the editors this

mels/012334.pt|here's some of the food these were galactic grabbers
mels/007720.pt|was really nice but um i'm
mels/023984.pt|keep fundamental level they did understand that they need titties to make profit
mels/001269.pt|first things first saying hi to
mels/015087.pt|at the same time hollywood started waking up right as
mels/011548.pt|the only good profile picture is a photoshop picture of yourself with

mels/019285.pt|here is I went through and
mels/007086.pt|but that was just to be a dick all right
mels/024628.pt|now as i recall a large portion of my chatter said what i'm a zoomer i don't like this
mels/002817.pt|he said there's no way he could have done it because he hasn't even had sex in ages
mels/011419.pt|same without him for real congratulations
mels/015583.pt|and they don't make their own content really but what they do is they buy
mels/026342.pt|isn't that extra amount of money on apple products and you notice the the diff difference
mels/003290.pt|it has been rising to bear with me
mels/003881.pt|one heads that are like yeah i
mels/005203.pt|listen here's the deal i have converted my stream into a live powerpoint presentation or everything i say is only delivered frame by frame slowly i actually called up spectrum and said it would help me grind harder for my stream if you could constantly throttle and take down my internet and so they said are you sure because we'd love to give you great quality affordable service that never as any skips or lag and i said no i said give listen here's the deal i have converted my stream into a live powerpoint presentation where everything i say is only delivered frame by frame slowly i actually called up spectrum and said it would help me grind harder for my stream if you could constantly
mels/011350.pt|it was such a that was such a that was such a
mels/023903.pt|it cemented him as the goat i don't think anything else could i think the fact that he came back from so many slumps to win against the best to do it right now
mels/031044.pt|was like in the cracks of every window and like there was just deep black mold
mels/004865.pt|work tesla basically trying to cut
mels/025117.pt|worse is it possible that they were getting fined for their underhanded content
mels/004576.pt|the little cap that goes onto
mels/001157.pt|literally every day back to rules actually
mels/027257.pt|the gamers the fact that they choose not to do it does not mean that they couldn't do it you know what i'm saying elden ring runes are for sale on ebay right now and they could tap into it and they choose not to
mels/003758.pt|i can have to do it because
mels/021016.pt|we have been ahead of their time you know to me as a young millennial
mels/023108.pt|marketing is pure insanity and i resent
mels/004777.pt|and again if they drop a certain amount
mels/025723.pt|seeing for the strategy on that one is the concept is being an advertisement at all we're
mels/026039.pt|it's like a draft amazon is hiring employees as if they are about to go to war if they keep up this growth they'll be
mels/032381.pt|when i read his comment i actually hit
mels/020987.pt|these are actual quotes from people who watch that
mels/021121.pt|you know we can all find things funny in different ways wendy's gets
mels/031416.pt|six going out there to play some bocce ball
mels/003444.pt|we're not interesting it's so important is that
mels/018190.pt|plurality around three to five yeah this is a good range i would have given
mels/027981.pt|in the fail well i i knew
mels/021070.pt|the help so uh yeah we're
mels/014318.pt|there is no problem it is extremely valuable and the fact that
mels/004426.pt|it'll be on saturday i think it'll be dope it wasn't a vacation it was a
mels/018617.pt|other people's content and those studios didn't know the value of their content on streaming so they
mels/003548.pt|what i've noticed from streaming i've noticed the the number of people who find dumerism to be more of like a
mels/006647.pt|heard that i a obviously it's a short-term that i i i might squeeze the blues but to heard that i a obviously it's a short-term today hey obviously it's a short stream today
mels/031116.pt|i was seven he'd never done it
mels/022878.pt|it's between a trillion dollar company and a multi-billion dollar company
mels/025223.pt|that was honestly more of a fail but
mels/027931.pt|avatar nobody who got fired by you
mels/019315.pt|and i get paired off into a team of these two people the first one his name was eric i'm
mels/009537.pt|in this game over two kills
mels/021274.pt|i don't know what number i landed there's
mels/007278.pt|iraq branding you might be seeing some merch
mels/001317.pt|like it wasn't appealing to me so i never thought anyone would take
mels/004927.pt|i like they they closed the door one of the agreements of the deal that
mels/006183.pt|fuck off i said listen buddy if i don't get my
mels/010300.pt|seen him by fall guys not once now i
mels/011047.pt|it feels like it's either obvious or it's not i'm interested
mels/031528.pt|but like artosa says that many
mels/022813.pt|app which i'm sure will rise even more to the moon like gamestop stock at this point they decided they wanted to go shopping and they found a sucker let me show you this man this man was the ceo of time warner communications and because of the magic of
mels/012809.pt|he was like bossing us all around he would tell me to play zillion and
mels/032369.pt|music play the same thing over and over for a grinder hall of gods is significantly easier because you don't need a long set of focus you can just
mels/026992.pt|this feels like a real it
mels/012113.pt|tower one tower five and i'm like
mels/013713.pt|what i want is i mean this could also be
mels/027895.pt|in longer term what if we take over canada
mels/029462.pt|i come back and the mood has changed clearly dwight has talked him out of offering me the internship so he comes back and now he's asking me like oh what did you think of cube world and he's trying to
mels/031779.pt|i have never what is s 3k
mels/015353.pt|the problem is twitch pays you out all
mels/031762.pt|sorry this isn't a show at all that's what
mels/026636.pt|the half so they have in cash just sitting around in cash the value of sony this is
mels/005720.pt|there's no there's no avoiding it he and they were talking about like the
mels/004540.pt|okay tell you what it's a little late for him so maybe
mels/017295.pt|thank you for introducing us into the wonders
mels/004860.pt|yeah there's a lot happening but uh
mels/025342.pt|asked me the night before the stream because
mels/000263.pt|and i like i just like it for his company i think he's a funny guy but now that now
mels/024437.pt|i they just made the pepsi float around him so i wasn't that impressed but it was still cool i mean it's still
mels/021862.pt|in the league of legends or valorenter
mels/001218.pt|and you are extra good at
mels/029573.pt|it kind of chilling at the time to think that there could be more than one
mels/028211.pt|it comes down to the office and he's interviewing and this is where i sort of get to talk to blur for real for the first time we
mels/024412.pt|of a big multinational corporation i love this i love paying
mels/024577.pt|okay but at the end of the day when you did this and violated your agreement with apple you broke a contract and there's nothing more sacred in this court of law than a contract so at the end of the day you have to pay apple 12 million dollars for violating
mels/018583.pt|in marketing blitz they have great titles disney plus is doing well it has not
mels/003665.pt|it should be taken care of but that one guy makes more money than the other
mels/027523.pt|i always wondered that and then when this deal came out this
mels/027827.pt|but let's look at this actual company so this is
mels/031036.pt|we looked into the walls because we were trying to get our deposit back by the way vlad took my entire deposit wholesale
mels/009489.pt|the shopkeeper will stop accepting gold
mels/013732.pt|what the garbage to your human so
mels/030568.pt|there that's a more candid one
mels/003436.pt|you know that the the discussion is that he may consider making a move on taiwan elected it's not elected by like the people it's by like the other communist party representatives what i believe it is it actually an election amongst the party although the party kind of votes in lockstep with him and you know the the the discussion is that he may consider making a move on taiwan elected it's not elected by like the people it's by like the other communist
mels/013345.pt|but i wouldn't lie to you that's the
mels/024871.pt|that is the idea that people are more afraid of losses people hate losing more than they love winning i explained
mels/003083.pt|and no longer feels as funny it's not it's
mels/004544.pt|i know it's a little embarrassing but it'll actually be great it'll be great for your political career people will love it this will be a big idea for
mels/002392.pt|in eyes on it and have a good time and because you know if i had to wait till after work i'm not
mels/002757.pt|work uh to get you paid out
mels/024468.pt|and then they follow it up with this
mels/015751.pt|future that doesn't exist because people are literally just scavenging the parts they need and so
mels/023029.pt|reduced or removed because a lot of innovation has now been stifled down to a few gigantic corporations basically just rolling in free cash on everyone else's innovations
mels/000923.pt|well what do you want we're gonna negotiate
mels/021257.pt|i worked on the face of the planet we also have
mels/009905.pt|i think yeah i think you have i think you have to
mels/004033.pt|everyone's already played the cat game i'm a little late to the party
mels/011243.pt|every corner of this house there's one on the
mels/009188.pt|pretty cool especially as a side gig it's uh
mels/000912.pt|to freedom something they can never
mels/009916.pt|i have like actual legal power or a strong union that can sort of just negotiate in good faith have an actual power struggle you know so it's like they have to
mels/025073.pt|the huge conglomerate nestle claims to be the world's leading nutrition health and wellness company when asked to make their cereal
mels/029099.pt|we're doing that there's a reason why pokemon has become the largest franchise in the history of entertainment i know the reason hot
mels/011698.pt|visual representations of what's going on
mels/017258.pt|this is a fail america let's get our priorities straight okay
mels/005399.pt|who is now like a 30 million view month
mels/014738.pt|anyway i guess thanks for the impersonation miz really
mels/020980.pt|and they review consumers and i'm like damn that cannot be the funniest thing it just
mels/007881.pt|as you said pipe above door in front of elevator you already looked at it i assume i missed some kind of pipe
mels/027729.pt|blunt and chill we ninjas fam he's fighting right
mels/020153.pt|i'll tell you why they're isolated from real communities working service jobs they hate while barely making ends meet
mels/009748.pt|you know the technology isn't there today it certainly wasn't there
mels/000617.pt|about this thing and again until this point it has been honestly i'm not kidding i
mels/015302.pt|i wanted to say i own the place now
mels/001726.pt|he's a degenerate gambler and he's going home
mels/029029.pt|but we both liked the same girl and it
mels/004358.pt|or for you felt like that was worth it because you had to go get that you
mels/006491.pt|what about incredibly low savings rate and people spending on credit cards and debt is as
mels/023676.pt|okay i must look very petite today
mels/029789.pt|the that was sort of the fall of scar as a player and
mels/001316.pt|i guess i never thought about it i've seen a couple of those primitive builds and i always thought who cares
mels/024483.pt|i thought it was it was resoundingly you know one of the worst ads i saw this
mels/023227.pt|in the box but when i first noticed it
mels/028171.pt|i never heard of this guy how important could be this this guy
mels/000990.pt|it seems to have a birthday all the time it's like what when did that become a thing
mels/001434.pt|okay let's make it easier let's make it easier let's make it easier what is the name of one of the star wars movies
mels/004182.pt|shall we could do any other time and then he's like yeah talk to my assistant and then i
mels/013648.pt|women relate to you and then i can't tell you that story
mels/029590.pt|his performance and how he really kind of didn't have the
mels/021917.pt|i have a chat okay funky segments
mels/012887.pt|was probably a waste at least for sophomore year
mels/001380.pt|first letter of your first name and then i have to guess the full name it's it's a
mels/014430.pt|important it's it's it's starting to infiltrate normie culture it's starting
mels/027321.pt|if the way to go back to this gucci belt and i want to talk about why the difficulty
mels/024148.pt|the cold war kind of started
mels/023330.pt|in their grandkids to live in mansions you put your money
mels/028372.pt|executives will sit across from each other and say the word net back and
mels/004580.pt|we're not my son but i will give you a high
mels/001678.pt|it's only 14 minutes it's got a lot of
mels/021699.pt|sounds interesting because it depicts my chat
mels/000007.pt|we'd gummies we'll get to that
mels/003742.pt|right let's say you work at at
mels/008788.pt|just don't want to do that the banks don't
mels/003295.pt|because it's now over two hundred dollars for a family of four it's getting too expensive and if you don't like baseball like i don't we can save money by not going
mels/023949.pt|what is shifting earlier and it's basically how some zoomers are so sad about our
mels/003185.pt|in the gutter and employees are leaving
mels/020506.pt|it's the value of their future profits from their reputation
mels/028031.pt|better worker protections higher wages um
mels/029259.pt|add people that were just saying all sorts of crazy things
mels/018268.pt|pet suicide oh oh my girlfriend had one
mels/010316.pt|we're still on the morbius tour
mels/031313.pt|they have both the exits covered they don't grab me in public they have both the
mels/001275.pt|maybe you're thinking of sonic the
mels/022938.pt|where and how but we're gonna do it also they
mels/024821.pt|that's how you can keep people in there they have lots of things to do to to stuff to upgrade to progress along and that's how you can
mels/018162.pt|it tested by pepsi this has gone from funny to sad hey look
mels/025645.pt|with fan-made projects the rubber met the road the rock met the hard place nintendo's lawyers strike again this time against a mario
mels/016348.pt|wait trends showing what a great time we live in
mels/002100.pt|as the worst of the game like mpg arena
mels/022903.pt|you're okay with what happened losing imperfection of a craft when you stop getting angry
mels/023522.pt|where your cost you can lower your cost
mels/001579.pt|a promise me dead seriously you're not
mels/031086.pt|it's because he set his goals at the
mels/029093.pt|we were at evo he like brought the baby to evo
mels/004515.pt|come on dude i feel like the bar is too low the bar is too low people it's
mels/004126.pt|in this case and i don't think anyone
mels/021484.pt|when they made these short contracts it was like under 20 which means
mels/000055.pt|in the hotel room all the whole weekend really
mels/016371.pt|accountability committee when the small business administration in sending that money out basically said to people apply and sign and tell us that you're really
mels/013781.pt|well there's one option that we've just heard about
mels/012038.pt|like you all have power with the force and i'm like bro we've been training for
mels/018198.pt|being able to say that alone is already a win that's probably something
mels/008585.pt|twice what that car is worth i'll pay
mels/023404.pt|it's like what did he say i think
mels/032345.pt|this implies he wasn't grinding radiant
mels/001291.pt|they don't even have any ideas they just
mels/008678.pt|you know like when you see a movie promoted on twitter and it's got an emoji and it's
mels/012306.pt|i put my heart in the game
mels/008800.pt|like they agree that if the deal goes through they will give him the money
mels/026232.pt|now pay later so you understand my dilemma here there is no advantage it's starting to have problems because people that are attracted
mels/010047.pt|puppet from mr putin you're the one who's doing all the
mels/006980.pt|and you know sometimes you don't get the
mels/023675.pt|hey sawweedy and thought to myself
mels/006812.pt|wait season three is coming uh
mels/008505.pt|it doesn't want to do it
mels/024851.pt|like new content they like seeing new things and achievers their main goal is progress they want to be the best they want to complete their collection they want
mels/016911.pt|i hope you thought that was something we're talking about and if you're interested
mels/009180.pt|that certain video like for example when i did the miami explanation
mels/027658.pt|it's advertising you could find a way to get more advertisers to show up and use twitter possible although i think advertisers will be scared because
mels/027928.pt|and beloved members of the cameo family
mels/015263.pt|the rich they are not like they don't have the money that an apple has they don't have money that
mels/015152.pt|if the growing their way out of the debt through pure content and
mels/001639.pt|what videos and it'll fix it but um
mels/017307.pt|the employees in america works for amazon
mels/002850.pt|like this judge and again the delaware court
mels/004356.pt|i know you want to just type in the chat
mels/002499.pt|it's very easy to skip but throughout the entire game you're like battling in cities and
mels/024499.pt|sorry it's not close epic games got
mels/020056.pt|within a few years from this yahoo would be defunct completely and then google would have youtube which is like so insanely profitable worth about
mels/004030.pt|that is a wins and fails situation and we'll get to it
mels/004608.pt|want a minute because i i want to show this
mels/020544.pt|in the farther out and so i'm very worried that
mels/025077.pt|the the go through the uh
mels/013274.pt|wait for prime it's sad but true
mels/014325.pt|do you remember that early days of netflix it didn't make its own content they literally just had like they had friends on there they had the
mels/005656.pt|i i didn't know that the the entire dinner she was just like polite and quiet and nice and didn't really say anything weird and
mels/018848.pt|i'm sure you guys are way too mature for that I would just say even if we take
mels/008474.pt|where the exposure i've given him then we will
mels/012380.pt|and for the big finale which is like the end of saturday night that's like because sunday was only half day and
mels/026860.pt|as celebrity endorsements goes first of all they picked the best one right now
mels/020749.pt|random misinformation then they run outside and
mels/007483.pt|anyway taffo's like my old melee coach
mels/013998.pt|thank you for helping me support the brand of this decade old scam dead
mels/024599.pt|it's pretty clever probably wasn't too expensive and uh and not only did it get
mels/025265.pt|and now i'm done a mario it's a me
mels/017257.pt|and that's what i'll say so this is a fail
mels/010053.pt|an album with the flag on the front that is literally eminem's album with
mels/029666.pt|it's funny though is if it was a 401
mels/019279.pt|great title that was exclusive and you don't have a lot of exclusives on
mels/000387.pt|i keep bringing me drinks everyone's giving me
mels/010437.pt|cheese fondue yeah there's gonna be some sort of like
mels/028224.pt|it's great i didn't see what he did at apex but i trust him i think
mels/004683.pt|unless unless i'm trying to get
mels/012912.pt|it really fun time but i thought
mels/024242.pt|it has to be for a specific product that's
mels/022674.pt|the myriad of ways this was a dumb deal so i thought
mels/009531.pt|what does the hook is a bad hook oh my god this is
mels/032398.pt|it's weird because he did say
mels/002378.pt|get near it but i came close
mels/031221.pt|i don't like that you know and the competitions are like all about business skills so it'll be like your team on
mels/029234.pt|okay okay cool i i can do this i can do this
mels/024938.pt|to not go in the direction of making more money these ways so that is one of the most damning and
mels/028070.pt|they were not getting it and that's within 20 years it
mels/009045.pt|you are desperately on their alienware gaming laptop hitting up their
mels/021896.pt|to be extremely helpful there's amazon's flywheel which is
mels/019937.pt|i don't include that number 10 of the
mels/021887.pt|because i can't imagine thinking you've won capitalism more than looking like this this guy's probably like in his
mels/017806.pt|intelligent for for the modern times okay
mels/002968.pt|i'm gonna tell you guys what
mels/006833.pt|in the back don't you guys have cell phones just play the new blizzard mobile warcraft
mels/018390.pt|is porn porn is one of the industries
mels/007587.pt|well if anyone's there i had a blast really cool time really cool time
mels/010822.pt|or balloons or it's fall guys those are my options
mels/028002.pt|it's like 9 billion and they don't have a
mels/009937.pt|if you know it wasn't that bad this is bullying
mels/032198.pt|it's basically war it's basically like fancy war it's
mels/002921.pt|i had no problem with the grey
mels/020831.pt|but after a year almost of putting in the work in the trenches to bring marketing content to you the viewer it feels great

mels/028927.pt|she was fine with it okay i was just drunk and she was being
mels/022270.pt|so they have time to build some sort of story
mels/023431.pt|i know especially people that are like
mels/022683.pt|mimi's and tumblr got it and yahoo wanted a piece
mels/004260.pt|spend the v bucks instead of the
mels/011908.pt|and uh and again i wasn't helping in
mels/028075.pt|because they started looking around at the market and realizing that some of the other phone players were starting to add music functionality to phones music on phones starting to get a thing
mels/021131.pt|we can never make something that's not dated so let's lean into it
mels/000807.pt|and like when everybody's at the table i could toss a few hundred in and i just
mels/001611.pt|the world of youtube to get to the bottom of it
mels/027465.pt|that got caught on camera kissing timothy
mels/011804.pt|it'd be quite honest it looks exactly
mels/012278.pt|this guy this guy knows of ludwig and me
mels/029544.pt|meet scar behind like the in the side area behind the stage like
mels/030300.pt|that you would not embarrass me maybe dream
mels/022913.pt|it right the leak basically proves
mels/007047.pt|say happy birthday king happy birthday pingu
mels/010422.pt|what i was just being sincere i haven't thanked
mels/024609.pt|it went forward a thousand years with the release of fortnite
mels/016403.pt|at prices the higher medical care prices the rapid inflation of everything you'd like to buy or
mels/026993.pt|now we're getting down to the ones i wanted to talk about we could
mels/011727.pt|okay so this is the outdoors we get to the front of this prison and i'm thinking okay i
mels/008249.pt|talk about i mean we can ask him
mels/031382.pt|for delivery to the boat that the
mels/019843.pt|when it came out dude this game on release was probably
mels/011593.pt|be watching the end of this show if they
mels/008760.pt|and then he obviously tweeted before the deal
mels/010827.pt|the chat provides all of it
mels/003298.pt|the for me okay here's the fail let
mels/023727.pt|that i've been using for the past two weeks
mels/022408.pt|despite still being funny and being one of the least skipped out ever
mels/027098.pt|the knowledge in this guy i know he's he's
mels/022463.pt|on the shoes they don't talk about how and
mels/026892.pt|wait they really did well you're
mels/005305.pt|tell this point you know they
mels/006152.pt|off stream yesterday before the smite two crowns two crowns back to back easy
mels/004631.pt|usually this happens more often when nvidia stock is up
mels/001712.pt|the factory or the tim burton directed remake of that name that came out in
mels/030559.pt|but as i said i told the story out of
mels/015619.pt|in their first year of operation with all
mels/023968.pt|do this what's going on i think a lot of the takes i've seen on the only
mels/031841.pt|i know they have like their own versions of the archetypes like they have like a spanish language lud and they have a spanish language
mels/008805.pt|a while ago i thought the back out fee like most people was like hey if either party gets cold feet and
mels/011168.pt|how somewhere nag nag he's here somewhere i think
mels/010455.pt|and i think i got some good
mels/029555.pt|at the community but we were so full of hope i know i mean everyone
mels/005715.pt|i mean yeah you have to be we have to be wary which is actually probably a good point but
mels/006906.pt|full of free snacks full of free drinks i had a
mels/012215.pt|all the way to him and
mels/017495.pt|i think it's time to actually get into the marketing monday is that true
mels/031929.pt|we're making out and everyone's kind of like i mean i didn't notice the time i didn't know
mels/007724.pt|been months of glizzing and glurketing
mels/016923.pt|who cares that the cost has gone up a
mels/009782.pt|they're doing a lot of stuff
mels/027651.pt|it's it already didn't make much sense and it's
mels/027943.pt|it literally is true they literally have an actual ethical business model but what i would say is a cool thing you can do
mels/019617.pt|pissed off canada canada is after me i
mels/028362.pt|and one of the ones i took the longest time to try to not say is true north i think true north
mels/021234.pt|the growth rate has been absolutely phenomenal it did not get shut down
mels/031112.pt|and then when the moment came along which was
mels/002521.pt|now remember if you win this you can walk away with
mels/015051.pt|if he's open up netflix on the browser and when you're choosing to rent a dvd
mels/013064.pt|that guy and he was passionate about it because it was his
mels/010142.pt|i jumped up my lap curl
mels/015061.pt|popular valuable shows people binge it like crazy even
mels/016499.pt|a good trend helps and jeff bezos
mels/014260.pt|we can cut it back for the video
mels/008367.pt|and remix the same five ingredients into some new way to
mels/028970.pt|but maybe that's why they didn't like me but not these buses just to get across town to get to the military base and then i got to the military base and the only thing i had on the military base because the package hadn't arrived yet with my debit card
mels/012461.pt|but here's the problem so the the storms
mels/008823.pt|and if he just focuses on tesla
mels/006431.pt|past two weeks grinding for better weapons
mels/016722.pt|i literally are getting massive portions of their life and day back because of work from home and they are not
mels/019045.pt|stop meeting technically even if i wasn't human it
mels/024505.pt|i have everything they sold every v buck sold
mels/007869.pt|what a username thank you for the two
mels/015864.pt|youtube bought other people as well they and they got ecosystems and they're
mels/011902.pt|who did a full like twilike she had the the
mels/029094.pt|and that baby could cry let me tell
mels/025557.pt|collar workers all like the office managers they got all of them to work the factory they got like a crash course in training and they're working the factory like
mels/022370.pt|it's not actually as we watch i want
mels/023180.pt|and it's because that's literally glue like not even a joke like most pictures of cereal you see
mels/009931.pt|he's officiating the wedding he's also
mels/028949.pt|yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah this big hill and what i would do
mels/017274.pt|nude he be your poo is free
mels/018316.pt|in rocket fuel your startup's doing amazing and you want to go public it's called
mels/000333.pt|though like you turn your gun to a chainsaw and you can it's cool
mels/010878.pt|oh they would respect my energy
mels/014994.pt|well seeing dramatic collapses and this is leading to
mels/019592.pt|or canadian they're all canadian it's a canadian band they hired to be the
mels/009635.pt|i i just hope they make one overstep and
mels/027505.pt|we got to this moment uh
mels/008582.pt|i like it it's got sentimental value and then a rich guy comes along
mels/015606.pt|it's not a bad deal broker's not a bad
mels/027793.pt|to start crashing at once and so like i said i
mels/006509.pt|it's basically free why wouldn't you do it and it sounds good and in your mind you can always justify you can be like yeah
mels/013911.pt|i thought it was i thought it was visually really good but i just felt like it was very much vegetables
mels/021526.pt|at the billions what are you
mels/032163.pt|and instantly it is gone here's the thing
mels/015990.pt|i think about it i'm if i sign up for netflix and pay what
mels/027909.pt|that everything else is sort of popping tech stocks
mels/024365.pt|long shot the next ad is by far the most
mels/029924.pt|want a tournament like the five gods win a tournament
mels/021061.pt|like they already have a low quality brand and they just associated it with your
mels/011615.pt|i'm working like a dog and so i can't really take any time off to do
mels/000223.pt|in my life so it's worse i should have just sam adams ludwig i should have copied because now i
mels/029051.pt|we off like he gets me off and i
mels/013944.pt|i'll pay later so you understand my dilemma here there is no advantage there is no advantage these things are literally scams okay they are literally just debt rebranded okay and so
mels/003851.pt|and they both like different parts of his personality and
mels/017748.pt|or so stuck in this pre-purchase
mels/010536.pt|and even though i know you're an excellent
mels/032239.pt|and just before i turn to walk away
mels/006665.pt|and that means i had to wake up 45
mels/012504.pt|it's like whatever it's not it's i'm not hurting for it but if i think about it from a rational person which i do about money i just think about it like
mels/013811.pt|it's been locked in they were very coy about it they were very very coy when the first they were like hey we don't know
mels/030935.pt|and then you learn your lesson that's the
mels/002999.pt|it's like you can just tell the unease went over the room and then i see a woman in the front she's
mels/015884.pt|it doesn't really it doesn't um
mels/028652.pt|at diamond supply co all right
mels/026371.pt|he percent of them said they were very slash extremely satisfied after their visit these are unheard of numbers in the world of
mels/016859.pt|for ai ai is extremely extremely important to all the big
mels/018420.pt|stadia by the way stadia spent an
mels/004841.pt|it's really because within that three months he also has
mels/003592.pt|are slowing hiring if not freezing and the smaller ones are
mels/005257.pt|you know there's some girls there's some
mels/007919.pt|it's a binary system and it gets the job done you know what it gets the job
mels/008926.pt|it'd be tough for me to remember this
mels/002060.pt|in popular thing i guess interesting no i'm
mels/010914.pt|this is so this is my own fashion
mels/013769.pt|when they're playing overwatch mobile only
mels/006996.pt|genesis was the first event that i have been to
mels/024143.pt|lupo lyric doc they all got big twitch
mels/015239.pt|it's but let me explain it it's about churn churn is the idea of if you sign up for a service watch something and then
mels/030185.pt|and it's probably even split whatever
mels/015342.pt|you know there's a thing called skin in the game netflix has skin in the game the content
mels/029651.pt|was to make a full rap before he goes up
mels/032027.pt|as wanting more like the one year bobby was
mels/023847.pt|i just want to shout out my
mels/020746.pt|not only a terrible message but it secretly predicts facebook's plan for ruining america look here's a scientist trying to say something important to a class of students americans
mels/016483.pt|well you know he wasn't a millionaire he wasn't uh
mels/016834.pt|you know mineral mining or transportation will be extremely more feasible
mels/031184.pt|he actually did so much to fill that amount of hours with content it it now that i am a
mels/011658.pt|in november which turned out to be like the market peak like my amazon and my nvidia and my sony like a lot of my tech stuff i sold like
mels/030607.pt|we can warn ethiopia about covid we can
mels/009641.pt|don't worry we got this late all we have to do is farm up okay we keep farming
mels/027416.pt|include it in a search engine so the
mels/022627.pt|i don't think you can be like they're like i'm not trying to be rude i
mels/013942.pt|a credit card and if you pay off a credit card every
mels/001357.pt|the team she hooked us up so
mels/010880.pt|are morons but after like wins or before
mels/010976.pt|it's this is a full body high
mels/024780.pt|at the battle pass because the goal is to make the game part of your daily routine once you do this for 20 plus days it is
mels/019424.pt|was like wow i don't remember who that was for it's so important so putting it in your jingle very important
mels/024948.pt|we're thinking this is so sad this is so cringe this will never be me i
mels/027137.pt|when they're low and borrowing money is easy then everyone starts borrowing money to do things like start businesses and hire employees and build factories and and so it juices your economy the problem is when interest rates are low you can't just stash your money in a bank and make money so you can see over the past you know 30 years the
mels/008245.pt|in eight dollars a year making eight dollars an article and
mels/024855.pt|it's very important filling up meters bars now let me explain how you make money from all
mels/004117.pt|so she had no problem with it she
mels/022012.pt|it doesn't work the second thing is that there's some people saying well all press is good press and obviously that is not true people already knew what bird king was
mels/018112.pt|good i can't how can i say
mels/011454.pt|hey are you a big simple plan finn they're my favorite band i'll be honest with you no no i'm not i've listen i have people can enjoy their own fucking music i i don't hey are you a big simple plan fan they're my favorite band i'll be honest with you no
mels/023632.pt|that's what we needed that's what we needed thank god i was worried for all our all our allies
mels/027490.pt|if the conservatives believe it will herald a return of conservative voices like donald trump to the platform and democrats don't like that and some also don't like it for monopoly reasons which is that he is an extremely well he's the
mels/010359.pt|you know i might get sussy with it and
mels/014251.pt|with the i think they just looked at his numbers
mels/016248.pt|i came across all 30 organizations every team
mels/028564.pt|walk through it and it turns out like if you don't fill out the form that says what price you got the stock at where you got it from and how much it gained over the course you got it then then it just gets counted as the
mels/028953.pt|skateboarding around you know and it was fun it was just really fun
mels/008088.pt|live on air to go to who that
mels/023660.pt|i put up zero dollars and made 129
mels/001738.pt|hey the weather clears up dramatically and they're making great time and he starts to get really nervous he's like oh no i'm going to lose i'm going to lose everything i'm going to lose my last bit of money and i have to go home and tell
mels/027250.pt|his brand of having the most boring skinner boxy in open world games if
mels/014464.pt|as deals i don't want to comment on those
mels/001074.pt|we know because the only thing
mels/008614.pt|was that doesn't want to own the company i mean there's a real chance that if
mels/015504.pt|who's going to survive of these two because they are
mels/001609.pt|we're going to watch videos that have three criteria number one don't be boring number two don't be too long and number three and most importantly at the end of the video we should have learned a thing or two we should come away with it thinking
mels/007706.pt|the find like a girl who speaks spanish and then try to
mels/020294.pt|if i'm looking at it i think this is like the
mels/020418.pt|with three three but three but it's
mels/013875.pt|it's paying massive dividends for riot all of their
mels/024010.pt|your membership quack salary i take it out of the paypal and i just i
mels/022426.pt|knows that i'm better at live stuff like music
mels/012286.pt|this guy on the right is an adult and you know the the crew are playing along there's one actor
mels/027090.pt|he dropped this incredibly dire interview
mels/020524.pt|is irrelevant compared to restoring the company
mels/004250.pt|nowhere near a bank and it's from a military exercise near a naval base they are actually not rolling out tanks in front of major chinese banks
mels/027662.pt|twitter blue or something so far the soft launch of twitter blue has been pretty underwhelming and not a big seller so it remains to be seen if that
mels/004933.pt|yet confirmed that he's canceling the stock
mels/012347.pt|some of the drinks were not some of the like fancier drinks were not inclusive but i believe everything
mels/010749.pt|it out but like it happens too often it's broken and so i can't it can't be trusted
mels/031394.pt|quit his job but before that he was making
mels/007474.pt|we're not really known because i asked her if
mels/018116.pt|which project before you got the smash bros
mels/022857.pt|over his entire career he never ever said to sell and he told the public to buy buy buy okay and they found out he never ever ever
mels/030171.pt|isn't bad losers we just and there's only one outcome in both of our minds usually is that we win and so when we lose we just try to change things to make that happen anyway either way we've been competitive forever so we were competitive at
mels/014632.pt|i have are finding new creators it'll be great for
mels/010423.pt|thanks subs in a while like in a minute probably four or five streams
mels/023712.pt|the topic is literally just the funniest ads of all time part due let's see what you guys submitted
mels/029979.pt|as the first time i don't believe so maybe like
mels/031324.pt|if the school group i will i will pay i'll pay
mels/018871.pt|at the idea that everyone would think the way LeBron delivered this line is very
mels/001290.pt|i see if they can do it
mels/026259.pt|your money would have gone up like five thousand seven hundred and eighty percent and there are many reasons for this
mels/016124.pt|probably probably in a week or so after i visit arizona and uh going to be doing
mels/010720.pt|do that like for example here's here's a random example what if you had a pretty solid amount of income higher than you'd ever had before but you wanted to hide some of it as a business expense well then what you'd do is you would
mels/003313.pt|press release redefining recession right before thursday's
mels/027352.pt|use this for almost any brand i've used this in
mels/015665.pt|prime video is going to keep prices low get infinite
mels/022078.pt|that would be funny or relatable from maybe like basic white girl account but not funny from chase bank a multi-billion dollar
mels/023951.pt|go anywhere else canada has realized they're so bad at marketing
mels/000332.pt|anyway anyway it's it's it's fun it's
mels/019547.pt|god wait what is this some guy wrote
mels/005733.pt|i think he knows what he's doing
mels/001123.pt|i they trend a lot and
mels/008047.pt|it would hurt my throat because it's a hard voice to do for
mels/029257.pt|little do you know i'm still haunted by the
mels/012476.pt|like they just assume that we've learned a valuable lesson and they're like buddy buddy like
mels/017737.pt|and but i wanted to say this is
mels/020760.pt|mark zuckerberg man of the year the marketing monday man of the year this is a gender neutral award but it dates back to the
mels/028849.pt|in my back so i walk around the office and i just steal soft things from people's desks like for
mels/012640.pt|it's a year same time every year doesn't change
mels/002322.pt|i shaved i just tore off my facial hair
mels/031840.pt|pink is italian wow it literally looks like italy the italian streamers literally look like the boot of italy on the island of twitch that is cosmic fate
mels/006837.pt|actually going crazy with it actually going nuts with it
mels/004602.pt|it's a big day and this is a big deal and
mels/021835.pt|the way i structured this is i pulled out like i think three things that i think are actual lessons that i might use and i figure if i might use them in my real life you might find benefit
mels/020530.pt|i guarantee it they'll do everything that kind of chug away this game until i guarantee it they'll do everything they can to
mels/009766.pt|in what way in like a way where she doesn't
mels/019359.pt|it's so bad the teacher remembers it i want to
mels/021455.pt|that would mean it's more valuable
mels/001618.pt|that it'll help it's a it's your it's better than nothing but if your entire diet is like
mels/009690.pt|get his liver eaten out by an eagle
mels/011692.pt|i'm going to have fun i'm going to get into it i'm going wanna i want to be part of the action i'm going to have fun i'm going to get into it i'm going to i want to be part of the action okay
mels/000384.pt|i'm drinking um quite a bit at
mels/008447.pt|right direction than everyone else and i think that's sort of what
mels/007731.pt|when the enron hats will ship well i'm having
mels/004978.pt|a scroll back today through some
mels/005202.pt|i own i don't think i i don't think
mels/025056.pt|google microsoft facebook basically across the entire globe not a lot of variety here it's basically
mels/020700.pt|part of your brain that uses visual memory is that it's disgusting what a truly
mels/010030.pt|that's such a weird thing to say if i'm talking to the camera i
mels/024981.pt|would think you're the world's biggest douche
mels/016155.pt|if someone it's pretty underground story
mels/014876.pt|i think the executives on the xbox side kind of get it i think they understand where they're at and how they can keep growing and they keep doing
mels/023618.pt|dr squatch so okay i've been using these
mels/014391.pt|and it makes it very hard to switch because you know your community be lost but now what if that was easy what if

mels/016792.pt|population is rising out of poverty that is a
mels/019399.pt|and show this and talk about how good our company was doing we crushed them dude by quarter eight it was an absolute laughing stock we

mels/018719.pt|it's like a pressure price it's like a price that just makes you want to jump on it now what does sony
mels/031866.pt|which makes people excited and want to install
mels/016273.pt|for the lakers but let's flip it back to
mels/002106.pt|i was gonna say do you guys remember on marketing monday this week
mels/026708.pt|makes perfect sense why they were behind him because he was orchestrating a deal to get them out of all of these problems and dump it in microsoft's lap and so today

mels/025591.pt|you simply have to check this out
mels/001631.pt|oh new maps to conquer that's that's the opposite of the the videos purpose because there is a new map the one thing i want you to know
mels/025472.pt|but because they actually did a really good business idea and purchased keyboard company high ground
mels/003722.pt|there's there's been a ton of like pressure
mels/030086.pt|is are like busy the day it
mels/022539.pt|the cool fun irreverent place to work it
mels/005503.pt|and we have you know we have obviously a politically diverse family
mels/004806.pt|he's agreed to buy it so what
mels/019962.pt|and aladdin and the little mermaid and it was like all of the iconic characters that everybody loved were from
mels/015823.pt|the on you might be fun to react well let me do
mels/019236.pt|holy moly I did not know the
mels/017253.pt|and then if you can't do all that without going to jail what happened to this country what if you can't do that without getting in trouble
mels/009104.pt|cream in the middle of the book
mels/007504.pt|and then she comes back and she's like
mels/028172.pt|it's paid 3 million dollars in salary so i
mels/029394.pt|and giving everyone their bill and it's individual checks interesting interesting and i realized quickly in my mind with a little bit of calculations i don't have
mels/008618.pt|so based on what i've seen from previous legal cases they have forced people to buy the company in this case before an example
mels/030602.pt|not bad at all i was
mels/024141.pt|they had a lot of money to throw around
mels/026617.pt|if the for two and a half billion dollars was a crazy big deal in case you're wondering this one is bigger than all of these combined it is also not just one of the biggest
mels/009915.pt|we need to restrain them we need to have
mels/002988.pt|at the theater and we hear yelling we hear like
mels/016507.pt|we don't got time for that so instead of five hours i'm
mels/000942.pt|how about i don't legally change it but no matter what i do people still call me
mels/009124.pt|god damn it maybe i can combine
mels/012393.pt|we've i've helped my bad guys she's up
mels/007518.pt|coffee because i don't drink coffee
mels/013368.pt|i do a quick skim to sort them and order
mels/028823.pt|so you might realize let's say you're a young
mels/004444.pt|one day on a sunday so it's a monday in
mels/011762.pt|i could come on you know where california
mels/020364.pt|there's some harsher critics in my chat
mels/010304.pt|i already asked him we'll see what he says
mels/007552.pt|it's the city named fanta in australia and i'm
mels/026038.pt|like they're about to go to war there is nothing similar to what it is it's like a draft yeah
mels/016439.pt|it of course would be a
mels/025809.pt|or one game and blizzard is the king of the block and so there's there's
mels/026390.pt|or extra cameras or whatever so everyone knows that you spent money on the new
mels/010435.pt|right because we understand that i don't actually drink coffee yeah mac and cheese yeah yeah all
mels/032326.pt|that they the little hint of don't
mels/014893.pt|pretty serious changes to make it better for players so um yeah
mels/027346.pt|added value so while i think we should
mels/016355.pt|at the number one on our all of reddit and
mels/029250.pt|i tim a a dash j and that double
mels/007653.pt|and then like hulu and amazon prime sharpening their knives like like like walking towards the throne

mels/029987.pt|was in the way and i needed
mels/015718.pt|i can talk about something i
mels/005505.pt|there was nothing i mean there was nothing that you're
mels/000812.pt|it was that go is the worst outcome
mels/027358.pt|and then things that are kind of potentially
mels/025071.pt|we've massive the amount of things
mels/013995.pt|we do have to pay later
mels/020066.pt|in huge and strong realizing that
mels/004350.pt|what is this what is this
mels/027360.pt|i think when you think about what is their core identity what if you if you if
mels/003503.pt|if i just came into a lot of money from something should i hold
mels/024155.pt|and claims to have made three thousand dollars it's just it's a it's a difference it's a difference in

mels/015862.pt|i was really shaken out yet i kind of want to get more data on how it's doing before i make any bold claims but
mels/007311.pt|if the level kid one of them was like probably i
mels/032136.pt|they had their whole accountant staff

mels/019304.pt|i know we haven't spoken do you still have
mels/012551.pt|harry potter would farm money i think it
mels/027267.pt|are turning out that that stuff wasn't affecting consumer protection it wasn't hurting their brand what this study found was that low brand image is much more damaging than low brand quality and they do things differently they have different show ribs their shrubs look look much more high quality they don't do tv advertising there's no that are turning out that that stuff wasn't affecting consumer perception it wasn't hurting their brand what this study found was that low brand image is much more damaging than low brand quality and
mels/029616.pt|i feel like what i feel like both of what you're saying i i see both of what you're saying
mels/019305.pt|the deck we made for this marketing project and he's like yeah
mels/028775.pt|that i knew if i told
mels/021560.pt|it could literally shut down trading tomorrow what's the best time to sell well if you
mels/009394.pt|i have a career absolutely doublelift's the
mels/024931.pt|we skill-based i made that mistake myself a to skill based i made that mistake myself a
mels/031095.pt|the money difference i remember telling stans in private i was like bro
mels/004001.pt|great night thanks for supporting and uh
mels/005860.pt|i don't want to like doxx anybody or say anything that i
mels/008025.pt|and around every corner you could find a dragon that could kill you and and like
mels/027891.pt|yeah there's been a collapse in malls you can actually set up a business in a
mels/010728.pt|at you and me both brother but paying your
mels/024668.pt|it's a bit of a snowball effect where soon
mels/017600.pt|we stand out from their competitors so
mels/004939.pt|what i'm getting out dude this
mels/008217.pt|messaging but obviously i i would prefer them over the party that is
mels/019794.pt|so cool man it had everything people wanted i
mels/026998.pt|insane amount of traffic on the day they didn't tell any story with the ad so without there's no recall later you know it's tough to
mels/015309.pt|it's got that kind of money um
mels/026104.pt|sql health at risk to take a stand against a
mels/031793.pt|it was like the normie group
mels/021456.pt|at amazon by like a hundred thousand times
mels/026251.pt|and i want to give you a second to visualize what exactly a 3 trillion
mels/012183.pt|is a bunch of people in there everyone that
mels/015826.pt|either dies replaced with online or gets a version on streaming services look daily news watching on cable is like that's already so
mels/029578.pt|where it's like this guy plays this way and this
mels/016201.pt|it was like it's like it's like a
mels/004204.pt|is the vast majority of the time i've been streaming so thank you that's that's
mels/000340.pt|not a big deal not not a big deal not a big deal not a problem but apparently and luckily this was near the end but apparently it
mels/017955.pt|so yeah again focusing on these two areas has been just a big big increase in value for a lot of companies and people still don't understand it people still think it's this area which is marketing
mels/029165.pt|at the hours to do it
mels/003537.pt|we're seeing opportunities to get houses at at more affordable prices but a lot of places are slow to respond
mels/009143.pt|his decision to sign on the dotted line waive the
mels/016827.pt|talked about it but basically they didn't allow you to use your phone while you used it which is not good for our attention spans
mels/004174.pt|how about that come in look at the title get
mels/001011.pt|well one thing i want to say about maya is that she can't get enough of factor
mels/002769.pt|i dunno what we're gonna do we can do we may even do
mels/012462.pt|that we're supposed to know but i have
mels/012954.pt|i feel like you should have something in mind you should be kind of committed grad
mels/027823.pt|it's a risky thing because a lot of these companies are not good let me show you an example
mels/010550.pt|way league because it's the only way for me
mels/004386.pt|mean that i will pay you so real
mels/021650.pt|legends the avengers parody we didn't
mels/029427.pt|i mean i get the vibe that didn't go super
mels/027955.pt|with vin diesel do you know how bad that has to be people do not like to work with vin diesel for some reason and it's very odd and so i found this video proving that vin diesel is absolutely a treat to work with this is from vin diesel's instagram
mels/014095.pt|with this hero now to the average person maybe ninja is not a hero but if you are a content creator there is nobody more
mels/024318.pt|what i've heard from further research is that
mels/015922.pt|if you have shows everyone's talking about that demand your attention regularly you can raise prices the second
mels/008416.pt|it's like it's like ai generated off the
mels/024845.pt|the killers want to win and they will spend anything to beat other people they are the most likely to fall for
mels/028660.pt|and i buy a bunch of fake plastic diamonds uh like jewels
mels/023518.pt|five other cars that's a crazy stat ford does advertising gets his number
mels/012799.pt|what i would do is i would only play in solo
mels/024896.pt|the basic monkey brain that we use for most
mels/008955.pt|the like should i sell my shares and then
mels/025230.pt|i just stopped inviting me to parties because i play too much league of legends the the fail this week is whoever the chinese version of matriarch is i just stopped inviting me to parties because i played too much league of legends the the fail this week is

mels/025584.pt|it's dramatically over gesturing and one is

mels/020981.pt|what the chat said conor's going to starve
mels/009948.pt|with chance that there could be some sort of middle ground that we can sort of discuss the pros and cons of things it's either
mels/010675.pt|effing doing i want to see what's happening
mels/005450.pt|that is a deep dark blue
mels/007133.pt|i don't know it was it was
mels/025172.pt|saw this tick tock i graduated college with a degree in design
mels/001744.pt|actually i think it's an old
mels/014835.pt|after all the hate they received and the lack of success ubisoft says we understand where
mels/009098.pt|well you knob set correct i don't
mels/004266.pt|if by rolling out you mean rolling up and by tanks you mean blunts then i'm in i wasn't trying to get you in was describing a situation that didn't happen but that's another way to take it r v bucks fiat or crypto there in between there if by rolling out you mean rolling up and by tanks you mean blunts then i'm in i wasn't trying to get you in i was describing a situation that didn't happen but that's another way to take it
mels/007121.pt|the captain announced that like while we were while we were flying or while we were taking off
mels/011204.pt|too late king too late sorry buddy but you'll never get the nft on the back
mels/008280.pt|let's say five ten more minutes just
mels/031487.pt|two decades and compared to even like
mels/024333.pt|or the description for this ad is when british insurance company norwich union changed its name to
mels/025225.pt|this is a fail on all my friends in college
mels/025424.pt|can still be friends and compete there's not no one's getting hurt it's not a real war and then this commentator
mels/023208.pt|model of apple juice you're not getting a bottle of apple juice you're getting
mels/015208.pt|in these countries and you can make stuff way cheaper this is where netflix's key competitive advantage going forward is this is how they again time after time
mels/030308.pt|oh yeah i was yeah i
mels/024847.pt|the biggest thing i ever spent money on was hearthstone cards because i wanted to
mels/007098.pt|i that's not a joke i might be seeding six
mels/024554.pt|if the thing apple is going to appeal this i
mels/023919.pt|all right so that was that that was
mels/008011.pt|i really like it i've thought about it
mels/006433.pt|new full set of rune dragon hide armor
mels/013808.pt|i said unequivocally because there was a lot of uh fear
mels/005492.pt|but i you know i showed up to this family gathering and almost everyone was
mels/008445.pt|i was so uninterested in it you know i mean
mels/025362.pt|like they were acting real like um
mels/003359.pt|weiner respect of the imagination but it's good to
mels/013815.pt|so the real winner here is
mels/012363.pt|the for like three hours but what was kind of cool is that while you're at galaxy's edge they're still sending you missions and text messages so like there's even things you can do with actors and other things i got like
mels/007358.pt|but when there's a hard opponent i'll switch to fox like he wouldn't stick with it and like j mook was like the one who's
mels/023221.pt|you're right now okay this is my food pyramid let's get a box of these at the top and then let's get a chipotle steak burrito
mels/029393.pt|i didn't get it then i realized the waiter's coming around
mels/009590.pt|when the nexus dies on each side
mels/004215.pt|at this point it's like at this point a big gaming company banning
mels/006108.pt|not everyone watches melee i should've
mels/023797.pt|with the idea and i've always been excited about it and
mels/024809.pt|games have gotten good at today with psychological warfare that's that's level one okay that's like pretty easy to get around i just have a weak mind but if i
mels/027142.pt|you're faced with two choices to get inflation back under control they have to raise interest rates and the second
mels/007145.pt|fun at all i don't want to get
mels/027342.pt|if the and ring players who have negative reaction speeds it will be a filter and then they followed up by replying to their own tweet and finding someone else who
mels/003320.pt|to take part in the great resignation and switch jobs i think i actually
mels/028423.pt|one point he was the commander of the
mels/017415.pt|we've been really hanging out with other human
mels/025427.pt|they lag did you see what i see or
mels/013841.pt|what is going on they'll change their mind when they realize where their money came from like microsoft the most valuable company on planet earth is going to lose a couple
mels/010901.pt|i don't get everything ready right
mels/017726.pt|who bubble club these are all parts
mels/015806.pt|but but the live movies which is kind of amazing um will cable companies die out it'll be
mels/025555.pt|john deere responded by getting they couldn't get
mels/020219.pt|it's just pork this one's censored it must have been
mels/010696.pt|but i don't think it's crazy to say
mels/022516.pt|if the gross food that we're spending air time
mels/002133.pt|i legitimately think i'm not saying they're
mels/000546.pt|love was spring yeah and then
mels/032181.pt|at the time and that is
mels/029872.pt|he was an employee at twitch
mels/001673.pt|it literally worked it's actually genius
mels/015368.pt|talent they've got a great talent development program this is a picture let's make it smaller here for
mels/028410.pt|in front of all these people take this
mels/032072.pt|dude figure it out and so i had to room with
mels/022680.pt|into the future tumblr was big with
mels/019105.pt|i and so many other black people have to deal with racism
mels/014563.pt|in fact that i can pause take a call is huge yeah exactly it's massive and i twitch like added a new rewind
mels/024061.pt|months and months of no downloads total flop all right so
mels/029011.pt|me and mango are the same age you're
mels/005753.pt|it's crazy so after the first level of
mels/001881.pt|at myself as sort of not a visionary but the visionary a god if you no i don't
mels/004626.pt|and then obviously i diversify with some stance coin so if you want to just get a
mels/026949.pt|the up a little bit there was some user scores
mels/015123.pt|with a hollywood didn't because they'd already
mels/000736.pt|well it's like we all we're all losing together at least it's
mels/027528.pt|are they are indeed what is their research and development at twitter what is their
mels/024401.pt|what the next week for a new marketing monday
mels/021118.pt|hey guys look look look look look look look
mels/015649.pt|not working so far so those are our key competitors let me let me take a final stop here and figure out
mels/026626.pt|his companies bait raped on how much cash
mels/003360.pt|i only say this to keep people informed
mels/020169.pt|or something and just said you're
mels/011062.pt|you know i don't have i don't have as many
mels/019419.pt|in a few seconds right after you get some water
mels/001858.pt|in two weeks of back and forth
mels/024008.pt|there's like a law where if a bank is found to have harbored money that is funneled through any illegal activity they can receive massive massive fines and penalties okay so
mels/012917.pt|so the the hardest number that i had to my name was that i grew the accounts from like 0 to
mels/014753.pt|we're you made that song we literally were doing uh best jingles one day
mels/015662.pt|netflix and amazon prime have been killing it and the way they're doing business their strategy seems the smartest
mels/012626.pt|as of sunday after the trip uh already
mels/007533.pt|is literally it this is the
mels/017892.pt|as what apple has done to great success and
mels/024076.pt|to right in a daylight like this this taco bell actually the kitchen sits up on a second level and then it has essentially four kitchens in that large kitchen and
mels/009225.pt|my friend's house and chipped my tooth and
mels/007075.pt|what you gotta take it while
mels/012244.pt|way to put you in the brig
mels/021375.pt|your 10 shares and i will give you
mels/013538.pt|sit down and they would feel uncomfortable leaving early so the entire lunch hour he would just beat them with mail and
mels/018814.pt|if the corporate zombie suits and Apple as the
mels/026769.pt|you guys know apple's been talking
mels/024359.pt|we like the core concept was interesting visually interesting you know i'm not bored halfway through i kind of want to
mels/005351.pt|like doing the head nod and wave
mels/023395.pt|in nightmare did you go to a good university i went to the best university arizona state university the harvard of the
mels/005688.pt|the once and making a joke that we were best
mels/025488.pt|if the stock okay but there's a
mels/003506.pt|it depends on what you're trying to
mels/009251.pt|around the holidays and i did marbles and i just bought
mels/022601.pt|you can use one of these old things
mels/019194.pt|hard it fell through in a way that made Sony actually really mad at
mels/009501.pt|some of the best skill expression on the champion and that was really nice
mels/005646.pt|in your friends we hang out we drink uh
mels/003118.pt|and then you go somewhere else and get a much more healthy work-life balance with better pay it's actually not
mels/022995.pt|we don't intend to make money off the app store the app store makes a
mels/007663.pt|it's just like if i get gaming time like all
mels/014407.pt|to a youtube channel it's just much easier
mels/026742.pt|the next slide that's really important you might notice it's blank
mels/003847.pt|the rock is the wrong person
mels/027153.pt|which is where they're in this real
mels/030512.pt|you know i forget exactly what i said but it was like
mels/032305.pt|the showed off that i had done something that's possibly even harder i had beaten every single boss in the hall of gods on radiant difficulty
mels/014998.pt|people are just watching less sports
mels/028546.pt|they're like it wasn't even the real patrick star it was just a
mels/031068.pt|three years younger than me and also had no income and he was doing challenging me to
mels/004185.pt|it's the web but we're we're getting there okay the point is we're getting there and we're
mels/019582.pt|or heads but it has the the brand name
mels/031580.pt|treat to get back to the base to save himself
mels/017442.pt|okay that's the difference for me the
mels/018426.pt|wait for the controller and then
mels/005190.pt|on a called cassidy i met cole cassidy i met carl cassidy
mels/018789.pt|i studied marketing in school we collectively will be sifting through a treasure trove of hundreds of ads to find the very best using a voting system one through five after every ad chat we'll vote we will talk about it
mels/009087.pt|hold hold no we're not doing
mels/000798.pt|i would have left with a nice little profit and i
mels/014467.pt|say is he agonized over the decision for a very long time you can also watch
mels/005189.pt|so anyway i have a lot a lot a lot a lot
mels/017740.pt|you could apply this to a brand like
mels/013948.pt|buy things more than they think they can afford and their paycheck comes around and then all of a sudden they are on the hook
mels/027376.pt|a similar model and that is make sure the old rich power people are looking
mels/031064.pt|i was like oh this is not what i expected and he was like really outgoing you know we were hanging out at a melee tournament and he i had a job i had
mels/001417.pt|wacky yo yo with our blocky
mels/004726.pt|the normal and standard and i'm sure many many people do it
mels/004397.pt|i had a good laugh okay
mels/028626.pt|i have not played i'm super rusty the
mels/023436.pt|i can't i can't tell you to do what i didn't do i stayed up
mels/013630.pt|i can't call it streaming wars in the day after
mels/016417.pt|they can tell you effect means and so when a
mels/006530.pt|i was a different story and actually there's a great article
mels/010307.pt|and then he feels pressured a
mels/000501.pt|like a chipmunk right here over the t i just
mels/011574.pt|i've kept his cat off cameras and the second i let stan's cat
mels/021686.pt|certain is better by rocket mortgage we even afford this house i'm pretty sure we can pretty sure rocket mortgage you can be certain not pretty sure i'm pretty sure you could take batista down
mels/032342.pt|and the rest of hog whatever time
mels/016081.pt|mckinley and they're trying to bring cable to online video which seems weird but it appears to be working and they make all of their commercials
mels/005843.pt|yeah it's a lot of money and he's like yeah people would do anything
mels/025048.pt|greatness and then getting on social media being like i was so disappointed
mels/007932.pt|i think i believe in skeletons what
mels/029944.pt|i ever heard i'm sure on his wedding day or when his kid is
mels/016453.pt|extremely negative for the average worker uh certain market forces
mels/000814.pt|the wallet is still a little bit in there
mels/027650.pt|it's all of the shares he's buying my shares this is just for him but as a company it is no longer
mels/028177.pt|what exactly is going on but at least they got snoop
mels/007467.pt|it's at ten percent chance and
mels/010531.pt|saying that even though i know you're probably very very very very busy
mels/013524.pt|it's good energy okay that's the kind of energy you need to attack corporate life
mels/028906.pt|stepping me up the stairs step by step
mels/011672.pt|so when you're driving up to you're like
mels/013982.pt|people don't want to go into debt people want the freedom of choice he said a lot of things that were like fancy ways of saying we are just a credit card company under a different name with less protections he he was a very good
mels/027774.pt|so this is probably not a
mels/015362.pt|the video let's get back to the content
mels/014077.pt|get off my dick jeff did you actually
mels/015296.pt|for the past year is massive but it was only 17
mels/032184.pt|is the two sixes the 12 in which
mels/007756.pt|that way he can still be fast in his
mels/014323.pt|okay do you guys remember when netflix used to be like
mels/021280.pt|millions of dollars at creators essentially no one else is willing to bleed that much money okay
mels/000730.pt|the last laugh always gets the last laugh and
mels/022340.pt|is it out and tells you that sticks in your brain and it became like this viral moment there was like
mels/006419.pt|the saturday afternoon you've just finished mining
mels/009241.pt|we're going to tune in a second i'm going to watch this
mels/029345.pt|i have a good time we're all enjoying it we're
mels/021385.pt|to give it back to cutie because i still
mels/031795.pt|and the king of that out of nowhere in this past month has become aiden ross who actually is
mels/027307.pt|they wouldn't be strong enough to stop themselves from creating the difficulty
mels/000527.pt|with the piano and there's three boxes on the pool table three nice boxes now let me give you guys a backstory here
mels/015597.pt|investment play they're doing well they
mels/013359.pt|well that's just a normal thing
mels/017471.pt|there was a it was a pretty
mels/020813.pt|i think more important awareness yes
mels/013025.pt|you know how to manage money and
mels/030734.pt|what's the most used emote in
mels/018324.pt|a company that has already filled out all the paperwork to go public it has done all the due diligence
mels/013278.pt|which is interesting it's a mixed bag
mels/025548.pt|if they should just be more organized so they have more effective ways to leverage their power because they have power
mels/027218.pt|unique aspect they did with not hand
mels/026980.pt|safe and easy way to get into
mels/008511.pt|because he was doing weird things like tweeting at the
mels/012052.pt|is if there wasn't enough lightsabers
mels/028084.pt|it's keynote speeches steve jobs has ever
mels/006644.pt|watch nhl ever that's the game with ice right
mels/029377.pt|well it really can respect and love elon musk
mels/025527.pt|i billion in response to that there was a
mels/027707.pt|if you want to buy like buy something of
mels/032375.pt|and i would get a little nervous and i would choke a little bit and then it would
mels/024115.pt|experience for you yeah so this is a major win what a
mels/010366.pt|but we should have a good day today i
mels/014362.pt|very a forward thinking on this
mels/010753.pt|the not not even like look at wikipedia
mels/003880.pt|and you know and also like there's like
mels/008366.pt|i work at taco bell should i worry probably not probably not i mean you should worry that talk about
mels/020562.pt|now and said console version coming in i
mels/016045.pt|i asked my dad about slime it'll be really funny
mels/017211.pt|annie disease is when you get cold sweats when your body is like frigid cold and you want to put a blanket on but the second you do you start sweating through
mels/000595.pt|instantly high because we took it like a half hour ago i start falling asleep
mels/013823.pt|where's back in the day for nintendo but all i
mels/021272.pt|like the star of twitch lately getting around
mels/002577.pt|andorra roll dice alright we're gonna roll a dice all right we're
mels/000849.pt|i rising he's a child that grew up
mels/030970.pt|worried about how maybe next time we're going to make sure our bowels are not totally empty
mels/015548.pt|that's it bro title is a failed music service he only bought it because he likes hanging out with
mels/017179.pt|and i'm gonna use it i'm gonna use it
mels/015394.pt|they've been able to put out uh
mels/003338.pt|which jobs have seen a reward which is cool
mels/027019.pt|i have forgettable last year budweiser sat out the
mels/011295.pt|at joke no i literally have an anti-cheat
mels/023557.pt|in fact that amazon is the biggest shopping service in the world to bundle it with prime to make prime video
mels/023710.pt|local recruiters might have tried it
mels/002916.pt|because they knew it was like they could get the widest possible audience the
mels/019615.pt|as marketing monday on the jingles
mels/014281.pt|but i didn't ask well i'm glad you can let her know actually
mels/020454.pt|it'll make what i'm saying sound more authentic the truth is i've been playing this game on and off stream i like it
mels/026862.pt|game right now literally like one of the most loved people in america she's killing it
mels/027667.pt|it's from those and then get you
mels/031797.pt|out of nowhere i'm talking about like
mels/026526.pt|it's like what the crowd is like what
mels/027447.pt|the the the contract and then right before it goes up
mels/027515.pt|and the utensils or hashtag team
mels/027744.pt|hatred of Apple they don't like that
mels/020588.pt|watch this is a this is a really bad launch and and you really really really rarely get a brand as sterling as what
mels/024046.pt|that genius was that a genius nine head
mels/032321.pt|one who believes this lie likely has not attempted the more difficult radiant encounters in hog
mels/025694.pt|well he was overruled or fired i don't have
mels/019243.pt|weirdly racist and I it's bad
mels/004466.pt|absolutely absolutely yeah no doubt that i will i will not play that
mels/009615.pt|what is comically bad at every game he plays chess league
mels/015772.pt|part of legacy contracts from back before hulu was owned by disney but hulu is not a winner of
mels/031917.pt|maybe there's a picture this is this is really this is not what it looked like at all but i can use
mels/020779.pt|released this year facebook groups kazoo perhaps and the marketing monday the monday for best ad of the year goes to
mels/014803.pt|it has been like just signed up by millions of people
mels/029363.pt|bread and water i don't want to i already come off like a kid with my riot gear so i order a meal that
mels/030373.pt|ring was as i was planning but she
mels/017644.pt|a verizon store costs less than half a
mels/009494.pt|the minecraft bed wars looking for control
mels/021186.pt|five and over have over 67
mels/004418.pt|things about it anyway the guy that owns scrub
mels/008731.pt|interior significance is the word very
mels/019380.pt|i had an excel sheet showing what all
mels/017904.pt|i just are selling because they fit into the apple ecosystem and you can
mels/013519.pt|my boy is new to linkedin and this is what he's posting
mels/031376.pt|and and like the balcony is literally over the waves
mels/008388.pt|so i read the whole thing it's i
mels/017886.pt|much hype but it's actually less and less important as
mels/028475.pt|if the heated as i have seen i can relate dude by the way i could relate with
mels/023650.pt|for marketing monday so i'm just going
mels/021747.pt|what i think it's a big waste jimmy john's now by the way if
mels/015566.pt|i pick off the carcass of the dead and actually make some great profits
mels/003474.pt|at the dog in actually what if
mels/011628.pt|in the dating and as of now i mean she's like in a
mels/027379.pt|scale to the big size and then when they get big they're more likely to crack down on it and they can use the power they have to force the people that made the content before to make stuff on their platform
mels/023125.pt|because they don't want you to find out that it's basically all the same thing and you know it's unhealthy for you this one is an intriguing example that i
mels/031114.pt|that's whenever people knew this guy's got what it takes or
mels/000693.pt|in the in the middle of the thing and like there's different kitchens and
mels/024504.pt|if you guys don't know the lawsuit kicked off when epic games who was sick and tired of giving a massive cut a

mels/025300.pt|but not for netflix just like conor subs
mels/017275.pt|if you keep that in mind you should be able to draw plenty of nude winnie the pooh's but if you draw the the standard iconic red shirt poo you can be sued by disney still disney

mels/011380.pt|a man sounds weird stevie blunder is actually a great name it's a great
mels/006915.pt|the same time it would be harder to quit
mels/026803.pt|work elsewhere they have to pay them a lot of money to work there because their brand is bad so they're they're losing like innovative founders that want to build with the company
mels/003534.pt|it but now's the best day

mels/026856.pt|i saw a lot of uh i'll buy whatever the
mels/025322.pt|boys and so my fail goes to blizzard because
mels/027387.pt|yet again the platform business model of steel until you're big enough

mels/012867.pt|your year it was like it was failing you know what i'm saying i
mels/015703.pt|like lily can really help with that so if you are interested please check them out in the
mels/012978.pt|or not even awful but the most burnt out

mels/014193.pt|ab sucks or i don't wanna talk about it but
mels/003426.pt|or is like a you know it leads to an active
mels/032222.pt|and now it's been two times with no
mels/019836.pt|they said 16 times the detail they
mels/000334.pt|but i get a little too into it i get a little
mels/018322.pt|the share on on robinhood okay it's not public
mels/028135.pt|oh they said they'd be in fact things are much more dire they were valued at
mels/011885.pt|so that was cool like the bridge was cool but again this is the only time
mels/009861.pt|some partial truth to that for sure
mels/011166.pt|it's to have half this viewership is room
mels/021034.pt|i thought that was a machinima
mels/028312.pt|i loved icon of esports okay everyone loves wheat
mels/024410.pt|inter of gaming that is powerful i am so excited for a world where i can walk around getting
mels/009011.pt|is that good content i hear woo was thinking i would open up a lobby

mels/019222.pt|this was not possible not even close right not even close but I was like oh
mels/022333.pt|and i added more and created the green out so we did the green out but instead of just doing what
mels/004848.pt|attempting to buy twitter he just
mels/012412.pt|it has come out and like point their guns at
mels/026704.pt|as remember a few months ago the activision blizzard
mels/027797.pt|actually the third outcome is both
mels/011868.pt|well you have your own like personal droid that talks to you and it's like it can understand what you're saying
mels/022265.pt|work and insurance company compared to a taiwan how do they handle
mels/019103.pt|which is exactly why we have to talk about it it's a tough conversation but i'm glad we're having it
mels/020482.pt|and sold amazingly so why is the stock plummeted that's what i want to get into cd projekt red has made a lot of games in the past okay this is not their first rodeo with cdp with was our punk they've made the what you all know and love the witcher three this is the game that really gotten their claim to fame but they've made a lot more than that okay and sold amazingly so why is the stock plummeting that's what i want to get into cd projekt red has made a lot of games in the past okay this is not their first rodeo with cd
mels/000034.pt|you guys just stole it and you
mels/016233.pt|my goddamn wedding and made me a whole marketing monday insane
mels/005754.pt|at one point later in the conversation i remember specifically it was like i
mels/007945.pt|when it comes to entertaining the audience i am just i'm happy to be here when
mels/018459.pt|who uploads twice a day every video gets
mels/027666.pt|i tomatoes and then you take the seeds
mels/013161.pt|i can't wait to play that with my chat
mels/006424.pt|to obsidian battle staff a huge upgrade over the mithril
mels/032333.pt|but claims to have done so legitimately i counted a total of seven attempts on
mels/014827.pt|if they're calling it the great exodus
mels/027316.pt|very difficult having something that is universally recognized as difficult can give them a sense of superiority or satisfaction that other games cannot and this is probably the dark side of it
mels/029426.pt|of uh universal he's like yo so
mels/018303.pt|i just the car to get you from
mels/007864.pt|we see what a terrible merch idea
mels/028291.pt|and he has no concept of decorum so let me give
mels/010075.pt|after i think it's pretty great people that have
mels/002559.pt|i'm gonna need a heads or a tails
mels/001906.pt|i have six thousand paying subs on
mels/002331.pt|but i'm glad you're i'm glad
mels/020451.pt|with the score this is a 9 out of 10 on
mels/022946.pt|wait why later but generally if you're arguing between a trillion dollar company and a billion dollar company
mels/007219.pt|i've watched it's one of the biggest like breakout runs of
mels/025381.pt|i was going to call this
mels/004930.pt|if done that so today i mean even with the deal being considered a go until today this stock has been worth
mels/008722.pt|oh god i wish i had the exact term that it
mels/031661.pt|one hundred thousand dollar cash prize in the title of league of legends world champions the season one circuit is comprised
mels/029291.pt|and for that six to eight months before i got the job at
mels/006492.pt|card usage and they're also ramping up another form of debt debt rebranded that i've been talking about which is called buy now pay later now i've done a lot of marketing
mels/004298.pt|that's literally and figuratively oh is
mels/015659.pt|these guys if they're if their strategy
mels/013364.pt|it would be nice if it gave me at least
mels/029933.pt|where i was saying like you know of all the sets that i loved
mels/030869.pt|it is grind to gold day
mels/029834.pt|yeah he's admitted to it yeah he should
mels/008637.pt|that's no that's the argument if they fight with elon if they side with elon it's a really really really bad precedent which is why i think it's very unlikely the delaware court which has always been a pretty
mels/020167.pt|wave this is crazy dude if gucci tweeted
mels/020835.pt|the facebook tune in again next year for the return of marketing monday season
mels/007225.pt|and he's like hey i'm a little worried that like

mels/001403.pt|i have a zero tolerance policy on stream based trivia cheating
mels/017928.pt|thinking of the business model that has
mels/002996.pt|been in a situation where i've seen

mels/000436.pt|seven seven eight nine in a
mels/022721.pt|you know this iphone thing that came out five years ago it's doing pretty well we should get in on that so five years after the iphone they decided to make their own they thought okay we have to get into that game mobile's getting kind of big and so
mels/028132.pt|we all imploding almost every spec that
mels/013878.pt|it's not that fun to get into if you loved arcane but you can play

mels/024445.pt|we're now it's uh innovative and i'm impressed
mels/014140.pt|twitch started to get real tight with the purse strings once they
mels/030281.pt|and so i look at him i look at the butcher knives in his kitchen and i think i really think about it i'm like
mels/026673.pt|because it was so obvious to me like
mels/020555.pt|where cyberpunk lands i think it's fair to say after all of this
mels/022768.pt|that it would go down and so when it did go down because he couldn't sell it he made money off that he basically knew instantly and he used that to get a billion dollars join the trace commerce club
mels/023809.pt|nothing just the late night filings
mels/029324.pt|world's jacket i think it was
mels/013158.pt|it's the oh a hit is relative it could
mels/021065.pt|it'll be worth it if even one person says the name k-mart i'm actually crying
mels/025066.pt|are limits they agreed to and they breached
mels/012103.pt|if we have to stop it we have to they're
mels/028227.pt|and eventually because we hard vouch for blur it is decided we need
mels/016594.pt|three billion dollars and have a lot of big
mels/004552.pt|be a little shy actually maybe we'll just get him to
mels/029700.pt|nowhere near mega i felt kind of good

mels/022204.pt|as we all get extra emotional
mels/019879.pt|this game i can't think of one game where the graphics have been this good and the game this disappointing and it's beautiful and it's clearly made by star wars fans and it has so much detail
mels/027122.pt|the government just printing a bunch of
mels/009018.pt|i can't i can't with these guys

mels/009125.pt|if we get me jeff bezos
mels/019080.pt|to sell product which has always been
mels/000641.pt|the story i said the trick to beating casino is to never give up

mels/016405.pt|outstanding currency was printed in the past like four years
mels/019504.pt|it's just a picture of a logo but the idea is that every time you see it it's more likely to stick in your brain
mels/023264.pt|at the next time you assume your taste buds are up to the task although i'll be honest with you so i've seen that video and i um ari my fiance always talks about
mels/022713.pt|smiling because he just made a
mels/004820.pt|it's funny because yesterday he also began a really

mels/005291.pt|and that experience i just had told me like probably not that was my first experience in line so when i get to

mels/016061.pt|i presentation on marketing on twitch and youtube so the person who inspired me to do marketing is
mels/022075.pt|the most common ones that i've seen the less common ones are when brands try to be funny because generally the the most common ones that i've seen the less common ones are when brands try
mels/031726.pt|to pretend to be the soldier
mels/022152.pt|no you're wrong but really you're mostly right but
mels/019529.pt|come back to my discord i know she left but just like let's make it a clean break i gotta say the one thing that makes this ad so good is how cute they made the dog cute i said i didn't say sexy furries i said cute
mels/015729.pt|you'd think piracy has been declining basically every year
mels/007749.pt|get a foot race back when he had like
mels/004420.pt|but first he had to take a
mels/022733.pt|it's so they they bought it and then
mels/025407.pt|the real contest will be is it worse than the iconic kendall jenner pepsi ad that is the real question who has made the worst
mels/021212.pt|these dots represent shows okay and these four boxes represent how much
mels/000781.pt|how did i lose all that extra money because
mels/000813.pt|so i have to i again i showed aria the
mels/004424.pt|so there's a very real chance that this saturday we will have a scrub daddy millionaire a shark tank millionaire on the broadcast talk about what it was like pitching and maybe even watch a little
mels/010968.pt|you know even if we don't have a trailer i kind of want to watch one
mels/031101.pt|wait up to the moon crashing
mels/023637.pt|i don't usually talk about this because
mels/006009.pt|i was like a it was top 32
mels/010606.pt|i must be an angel i must be above reproach when it comes to my vocabulary and i need
mels/017308.pt|that's just a new piece of information
mels/018782.pt|i learned anything from today's marketing monday it's that whether or not you care about
mels/024751.pt|the separate you from your money so i chose one game in particular to kind of follow the story through this applies to a lot of games but i
mels/017398.pt|let me just uh let me just
mels/003143.pt|was like seven billion dollars of market cap overnight like within 15 seconds she tweeted that
mels/022884.pt|you don't have to be a redditor to say fortnite sucks and that was actually apple's lawyer
mels/024854.pt|you know they like progress progress is very
mels/020861.pt|i know this because i've hired people and i've looked at resumes and just having the degree is often a way to get your resume through the first fit like do you know what i'm saying the power is
mels/020166.pt|the hard enough without the marketing trend of the day being insulted by every company we buy from you know is gucci just
mels/024944.pt|we'll get all of the attention and i think a
mels/007247.pt|and then he goes out there and plays an amazing game gets the grand finals so i
mels/019348.pt|to find this presentation because it
mels/013787.pt|just don't look too closely it could have been you maybe someone in chat made it
mels/008701.pt|i i'm trying to hide like he's got to prove
mels/023483.pt|in one thousand dollars okay ford is targeting essentially the
mels/017112.pt|i know you had an idea but what about my
mels/031620.pt|that's that's how we did it and that was
mels/003190.pt|we are due for possibly the biggest economic downturn we've ever seen and that he wants to freeze hiring and basically bad down the hatches try and survive the coming storm so we will see what's happening over at met up but it's a big l we are due for possibly the biggest economic downturn we've ever seen and then he wants to freeze hiring and basically batten down the hashes to try
mels/000956.pt|are reborn on monday and then they just all die over the week and so saturday is our only chance to rejuvenate but if you do it on thursday you still have some of your brain cells left to actually
mels/002530.pt|dollars if you roll again heads or tails
mels/031335.pt|big a deal you're all right like
mels/032210.pt|so we go to the crab stables sunday
mels/004547.pt|i swear to you dude come on come on as
mels/013475.pt|in there for guys it's like always like a picture

mels/025868.pt|for eight hours of play test for no money they couldn't stream it they couldn't make a video they wanted to just sit down and play test it for eight hours a day and give
mels/023583.pt|so you can do to grow whatever you're trying to do is raise this so i think i've covered it
mels/025281.pt|the global this popular every country all over the world it's the biggest hit possibly outside of stranger things that netflix has ever had and so
mels/022951.pt|so let's just agree on it now and that just shows you how
mels/027259.pt|well that ubisoft might take from selling items this also was a great example someone said if ubisoft designed the
mels/015190.pt|they're are spending money like crazy to create content that is compelling locally but can be sent globally and this is an entirely new philosophy for the most of hollywood's history stuff was exported globally but it was all made
mels/027499.pt|so i stand to make about i don't
mels/009560.pt|but i wouldn't he's getting greedy
mels/027332.pt|and players of their own game by getting mad
mels/016599.pt|industry and being in industries like
mels/016862.pt|at this rate and then since 2010
mels/022189.pt|the advertising brand that has figured it out the art the most
mels/019690.pt|for your phone number i know it seemed weird
mels/026345.pt|i a regret that accomplishes things that perhaps spending the extra money on advertising and having a worse packaging might not here's a great example that they have this is an internal leaked
mels/028638.pt|and he he comes into my desk he's like dude
mels/025896.pt|he believes or trusts a youtuber apology
mels/016330.pt|as out there that just can't miss
mels/009302.pt|small things you can make that would actually make the industry a little safer for people who are susceptible
mels/018646.pt|no i don't monopolies no longer get
mels/019386.pt|okay we were a total domination of the marketplace i
mels/005678.pt|really name names i just want
mels/027201.pt|information to market makers public does not do that they make the money off of unspent they just basically invest unspent money thanks again to the public
mels/026403.pt|up the apple ecosystem the green and blue bubbles the genius bar at purchase they have a better
mels/010705.pt|but bear in mind our rule on clippers yeah it's like santa yeah it happens

mels/026198.pt|i crazy dude you idiot how do you understand the deep themes of this six hour epic
mels/004995.pt|our breakup fee that's not he can afford it not terrible decent for twitter
mels/026112.pt|and the internet which severely hampered their ability to hire scabs there was a it was a pretty
mels/030258.pt|and i i cobble together some cleaning
mels/013142.pt|just take league of legends in
mels/002709.pt|to walk away but if you don't take this deal
mels/030506.pt|cause i know that it's cheesy dude
mels/019036.pt|that let me that confirmed to me that this is
mels/015793.pt|part of their plans for growing their influence
mels/024323.pt|so bad but if you are if
mels/015396.pt|oh bigger movie i think the matrix is out there right now and you can watch it all same day now other companies either don't have theatrical studios like let's
mels/004361.pt|i don't want to move on i want you to feel a lot of attention on it
mels/008454.pt|sat down and played with grasslaw
mels/002826.pt|a legal battle brewing between twitter and elon musk and uh the big debate for the first

mels/016900.pt|is at all time highs and it's growing
mels/005439.pt|i didn't turn anyone down and one common theme seemed to emerge from all the ones that i saw submitted to the
mels/007239.pt|if the them off his game and he wants to be
mels/029335.pt|guy who plays a lot of league like a
mels/009634.pt|nobody likes losing a 30 minute league
mels/010184.pt|really worried i'll watch it off camera and just they'll see my reaction
mels/024233.pt|okay my first thought is how the did that cost five million dollars where did the money go i guess they must
mels/002669.pt|and that is a number between one and six a number between one and six is all i
mels/019519.pt|the better more iconic but notice the difference between i'm loving it in this i think the problem with this is that

mels/001043.pt|it was just a text group
mels/020521.pt|that makes them one of the most valuable
mels/028045.pt|because all these different stores starbucks union workers are actually starting to make real progress on the other hand a more scary enemy is amazon so i mentioned recently that amazon had a very big union win recently
mels/026514.pt|you'd think again you'd think so many times that gamers would be the ones on board with this but the way it's shaped out is that gamers are actually the most vehement
mels/004765.pt|about the liberal bias of its current employees
mels/006816.pt|right here on stream you can
mels/001992.pt|be fun you can build a business pretty free

mels/011820.pt|and they always always have were able to roll with it they never got thrown i was
mels/023758.pt|oh this is a classic hey
mels/017553.pt|okay since then it's been an outsized level of success okay and there are many reasons for this
mels/002576.pt|five of your six dollars for a sub
mels/032008.pt|but it's not his fault he has the big job he has the wife and a couple
mels/026725.pt|and there's great games that could come out of blizzard on a larger scale i am very deeply afraid of monopolies and i'm very worried that gaming which has been a very competitive space as we trend towards consolidation with big companies buying up more and more of the market that's scary that's where things go
mels/026706.pt|and i remember thinking it's so weird it's so weird they're
mels/016486.pt|he came across the fact that the
mels/000149.pt|if the people that want to show up
mels/020432.pt|can bring us all together this year because it is it is the thirstiest time of the year let's watch that ad the
mels/014941.pt|i think yeah they're up branded alerts
mels/016429.pt|well that are getting screwed by this and i would like them to know that the root cause of it comes back to this stuff and i know that a lot of things get blamed i know that blame
mels/018218.pt|will ferrell so they got this guy and then they used kids of it's a
mels/012243.pt|happens hey good luck out there but

mels/021939.pt|things like where you work where you live who you marry and who you prime to on twitch okay you should focus only on a few big things to stress about but the general idea is that most decisions in life are what he calls

mels/024586.pt|the conscience and the judge said this is a billion dollar company and a trillion dollar company with a business dispute none of this involves the conscience

mels/010965.pt|fresh minions pizza challenge where you can make a little pizza with the kit they send you and make it look
mels/022129.pt|we're all aware that you're an employee this is all a scheme to make money
mels/000879.pt|not only helpful for you but for me to practice negotiation okay what do you want jake
mels/015338.pt|that's the main strategy they have is
mels/021056.pt|for free wow i just may
mels/030635.pt|there's like one of these thin little dk
mels/016412.pt|world was created in uh in france i i
mels/026919.pt|tour of zeus zeus he didn't cheat on hera
mels/031689.pt|i only like um cowboy bebop
mels/029157.pt|by the way the double a's back then
mels/024859.pt|flexing and uniqueness people want to feel like they
mels/025905.pt|apologize and apologize and apologize and until people like for some reason forgave them they just dropped something cool and that's the equivalent of kobe starting to shoot
mels/017174.pt|things that are not happening today but i do need to work on and eventually deliver and that is a
mels/019454.pt|i want wheaties to be one of the choices we don't keep very many choices in
mels/028437.pt|one day instead of being able to go home after school my dad
mels/016938.pt|which is an amoral business model this one is uh
mels/013741.pt|much into it but i think people that are obsessed with
mels/004903.pt|and he said yes he agreed to that deal and then right before that deal
mels/014554.pt|and i don't think any deal like that makes sense for someone who doesn't even
mels/029530.pt|if you are disabled don't talk to
mels/025663.pt|the monday today's topic is the scariest spookiest ads
mels/008113.pt|when he goes live and it'll be it'll just be really awkward if i watch all of ee stream and somehow it doesn't happen
mels/019086.pt|if the for me has been like when they're very
mels/000697.pt|we're really enjoying it and uh
mels/030716.pt|telling you that france made the statue of liberty
mels/009853.pt|and so you see like when they build a stadium they have to buy like
mels/006212.pt|this in there let's get this
mels/018810.pt|the stigma that has painted them to this day
mels/001684.pt|that does not mean it is perfect our goal is to expose the dark underbelly of the story to reveal once and for all the truth about the only
mels/023695.pt|that's so funny that you're just setting
mels/008937.pt|it owns a company could theoretically make changes improve its profitability maybe sell it go public again but if he just
mels/020446.pt|and not allowing you to make a more informed decisions about your purchase
mels/027576.pt|i take over twitter there has been a lot of people a
mels/028272.pt|it was he still worked there he was lying to us
mels/021708.pt|mrs long yes we've found a baby girl for
mels/012747.pt|it was worth it we all instantly
mels/028415.pt|so my entire life growing up i lived on military bases or near military bases and my father got to be pretty high
mels/015166.pt|dollars to make which again is within mr beast but in fact i think mr beast probably spent more on his squid game per episode
mels/011545.pt|multi pleasure media and uh pretending that any one of them
mels/014538.pt|it's the end of my my um
mels/018209.pt|if know that this isn't real
mels/025951.pt|number of ways in the way they're
mels/030613.pt|i was in fourth grade i was on a military base a nato military base that means the militaries from every

mels/025092.pt|people will say they hate the nfl and everything they've done to football
mels/024295.pt|the cheaper it would really undercut what they were going for
mels/015210.pt|there's a million new competitors that are driving up the cost of content they're already going into debt so
mels/022897.pt|is between epic games who says that the apple app store is an unfair monopoly that takes 30 percent of everyone that
mels/029770.pt|what they do i still have mine because i

mels/027806.pt|it's been happening for years and years and years and we've been enjoying it because it's been leading to everything spike businesses that don't really have a good business plan can survive for a very long time by continuing to raise more money as long as you were growing nobody really cared whether you
mels/002728.pt|so if he loses right now he still lost
mels/014493.pt|we kind of got you know we're on twitch you know what i mean uh and
mels/024305.pt|for it didn't have morpheus singing which was
mels/002232.pt|does anyone think this is actually
mels/005651.pt|while we're all getting dinner together
mels/014132.pt|in the platform but it's not growing to
mels/001189.pt|about the stream when they wanted to support they
mels/002943.pt|and then there was like one scene where
mels/018643.pt|in a monopolistic practices if they
mels/031459.pt|vegan um egg rolls or whatever
mels/022037.pt|i said he just didn't know he thought the guy was walking away people were calling for
mels/028179.pt|just say all things are not phased up

mels/013322.pt|you guys as far as i can throw you and i
mels/016946.pt|can buy partial amounts of a share for up to
mels/029279.pt|there was something special about tpp for sure
mels/013609.pt|got everything covered one more second on the song one more one more one more round in the song
mels/021916.pt|okay and we had chat members come in and ask them questions that's
mels/009029.pt|do you really want to trust your future on what
mels/028915.pt|the key to the story is that he told me he could not get a taxi
mels/014149.pt|if you start to blow up in that era you're not making any money you just
mels/007112.pt|something about how jeff bezos is a business legend
mels/015525.pt|top talent because to me it seems like they just want to kick it with hollywood they've got the money they think it's cool they know that amazon's doing
mels/001378.pt|hello hello hello hi you've been called
mels/027612.pt|realistically the problem at twitter stems from leadership rather than like
mels/031731.pt|this is what dewey looks like one of
mels/010590.pt|as being torn asunder torn apart root and stem okay every the economy is in shambles things are in disaster right now and
mels/015091.pt|netflix is losing stars play over
mels/021042.pt|and i guess it's promising these lonely gamers that that
mels/009469.pt|what we didn't lose because of seer sierra
mels/007768.pt|man gets hungry and you don't know what
mels/007374.pt|it was just an awesome tournament i mean it was it was it was sick and you know what when mango didn't make top eight i was nervous
mels/021288.pt|bacon drops juice the viewership make it the number one game guaranteed people
mels/000913.pt|this is true art without audio
mels/022043.pt|you going have your own i just really doubt that the person that posted this and
mels/008724.pt|dude it's something it's a it's a word that means that it had a massive impact not a small but a massive impact on twitter's business and they've basically been
mels/010287.pt|while guys tournament it's like of course cutie cinderella yes
mels/032299.pt|it was very heartwarming to see
mels/015725.pt|i think if you watch this marketing monday
mels/002342.pt|if you have to be up in four hours
mels/025291.pt|the my first win that's my first win and
mels/029398.pt|be guy who brought me here and ask him
mels/003800.pt|of the gauntlet okay where you you know you
mels/007537.pt|expecting a and by the way i have my
mels/024665.pt|take these big losses on the chin from things like evergrand they start to
mels/018539.pt|which currently loses money now there is goals that's why you hear about the new
mels/032298.pt|it's awesome let's read the comments and i would be very clear most of the comments were incredibly supportive it was very heartwarming to see after the fucking gracile that i it's awesome let's read the comments and i want to be very clear most of the comments were incredibly supportive it
mels/005892.pt|because carl jacobs and then he started
mels/001239.pt|but that doesn't mean you could not run a brand account people
mels/029630.pt|as got a really sad vibe so kind of lines up i i
mels/028041.pt|not allowed it has been already like uh
mels/022619.pt|in doing having trouble holding your temper when dealing with weak teammates online
mels/029739.pt|guy behind me i was playing amsa
mels/030616.pt|was that cool or did it suck well before
mels/015867.pt|what platform and a lot of differences
mels/019882.pt|is still great fable is a good game that is why when i tell you that it's one of the most overhyped games of all time
mels/032104.pt|you know i don't know how that knight
mels/012384.pt|i wasn't like i did i did my missions for i wasn't like ahead of the game hustling down hunting down actors i didn't i kids found everything i remember i i wasn't like i did i did my missions but i wasn't like ahead of the game hustling down hunting down actors i
mels/027264.pt|give that because it's distinct and i want to
mels/026183.pt|up with you better pray for these little guys a goddamn rat has a better gaming monitor than me
mels/029116.pt|and so for a lot of that trip people were working
mels/003687.pt|his lobbying and then um and then enforce it
mels/013940.pt|so yeah everything's easy fun smile clean app if you miss any
mels/028341.pt|to a kind of intense one and i can see dj we kind of focusing and and ben's always focusing
mels/029991.pt|or why it's just like i i
mels/014962.pt|which is nothing you know five dollars a year
mels/021198.pt|it got matrix four matrix was 20
mels/000357.pt|we incredibly incredibly fun and very competitive and we're drunk so
mels/002894.pt|if the the situation so i i i
mels/030919.pt|i think you've been really been a little rude lately okay
mels/021787.pt|we corporation care these times are so trying thank god for
mels/015778.pt|and eventually the main thing is that for the longest time
mels/010491.pt|be for my life i would kill for a firefly movie no i'm sorry
mels/002169.pt|and and you know just subtly
mels/016966.pt|so thank you for watching marketing money
mels/001379.pt|hold up to be the first contestant on a brand new hilarious game show okay and all
mels/007548.pt|was that meal bottom five things about world war
mels/031749.pt|the word golden grab you can just write
mels/026831.pt|this year well over that closer to 7 million
mels/013067.pt|but i just got interested in i was thinking about it
mels/002104.pt|it is a fun slot machine
mels/012810.pt|and then i wouldn't do that great and then he was like
mels/004145.pt|they don't want to pay me okay so big upgrade is that paid the musician is
mels/029422.pt|he hit me with the elon musk dude anyway
mels/017727.pt|and beyond the clock that people don't think of as much but they have a much bigger impact than spending extra money on tv advertisements these things have done more to market the product than that
mels/022551.pt|because pokemon go was not out yet no you didn't think that it would be years before pokemon go existed this is one of my favorite my favorite april
mels/025074.pt|well healthy they basically changed nothing slapped the logo saying whole grain
mels/011019.pt|playful guys you play fall guys are you playing
mels/000994.pt|they stopped doing that that means it's available to take
mels/019522.pt|it is a catchy jingle and this still goes i might have to just
mels/011408.pt|he's considered by many myself included to be the greatest player of all time and he's been top five forever forever and ever and ever and they recently put out a ranking where they put him on
mels/009535.pt|i this might go wrong tyler look at
mels/022552.pt|well as a prank really ties
mels/020072.pt|waiter billion dollars probably greater because instagram is essentially the most dominant and influential social platform currently if you want to advertise online you have two options you go to google or you go to facebook you advertise on
mels/010909.pt|it comes first and we understand that while we may love minions rise of groom we can't wait to
mels/026631.pt|in blizzard and yes you heard it right that's only half of the amount of money that microsoft is sitting on so they have plenty of money
mels/008519.pt|although if they do force them to go
mels/031449.pt|like got cuts he's got cuts on his legs he was getting
mels/012230.pt|all in and he shoves his chips all
mels/014482.pt|it's like joys of my life that i trusted my gut on that one and i'm
mels/013644.pt|i think a lot about the world and that made me relate to you as a human
mels/028876.pt|yeah yeah yeah of course i could do that and
mels/011283.pt|because i promise you your desktop audio is always way louder than you
mels/015398.pt|amazon prime or they are afraid of doing this like disney disney's afraid of doing this because obviously they make a ton of money from
mels/016229.pt|i have a big topic today
mels/013034.pt|i'm playing ori this week for sure
mels/020750.pt|and then education altogether getting the entire country screaming noise at each other instead of any meaningful dialogue

mels/023171.pt|heat in its life but that is a frozen
mels/023456.pt|i don't have any room so your goal as a marketer is to raise

mels/003456.pt|one taiwan it would mean that every other country
mels/006975.pt|by the way i'm not trying to whatever i don't even know i
mels/020519.pt|you can't blame the marketing guys for doing their best job what they've realized very quickly is that reputation is everything your brand is everything losing your brand means you're just another
mels/027566.pt|and so they started to get lawsuits to brew now most of these
mels/019094.pt|the the cost problem v tubers really solves the problem of
mels/028230.pt|but we hire both because they both crush the interview
mels/008348.pt|generally so he goes door to door

mels/009518.pt|carrying you know what i'm saying
mels/031360.pt|it all ends it's all over okay and that's why i'm a streamer this is my community service yeah i'm still
mels/028347.pt|it's something the game sucks he gets
mels/012075.pt|he really the actors were great i
mels/007989.pt|so thankfully i'm fully happy to explain it yet again but
mels/013478.pt|although tommy in it was this age and he was rich
mels/006378.pt|of course like every game it
mels/000487.pt|i can't stay awake like my eyes
mels/015893.pt|is not very good at enforcing antitrust and monopoly rules but even
mels/020299.pt|the snowman doing this a cutaway to a funeral with the kid at

mels/030065.pt|i got a fake pokemon red or a broken pokemon red from a trade on a bus that had a broken battery and i would come from school and play
mels/023368.pt|if the random logic puzzle and then i kept scrolling and then this guy said blue
mels/025104.pt|so i could see that i personally my
mels/016266.pt|so anthony davis was only used for one
mels/003695.pt|bad as now and something happened like you know roosevelt added those
mels/020618.pt|tyler blevins tyler ninja blevins the blev as you like to call me and i am
mels/021690.pt|i think it's pretty good stanz hates it
mels/023468.pt|it's more than it costs to make
mels/030467.pt|why confusing like i really i wish that i had
mels/025129.pt|i have a little bit more of a fire under your ass
mels/007082.pt|what i'm saying it sounds like i was really nice
mels/018397.pt|it's like about amazon marketing mondays
mels/003355.pt|if the situation if people don't pay their mortgages then we get a big widespread
mels/019663.pt|well remember how it goes so right then and there i got a piece of
mels/024789.pt|and then it's from there it's fun money for you and you just spend it without really knowing the value
mels/002369.pt|what it is but at least i'll have two
mels/004069.pt|gave birth to our beautiful nine-month
mels/001299.pt|if the corporation that needs a mascot
mels/001710.pt|it has to be noted that the vast majority of the memes around grandpa joe are solely about the version of the character
mels/009851.pt|events in america so you can't even build something like an apartment complex or a stadium or a school or anything without having like an equivalent number of
mels/015963.pt|nobody be like oh wait this is stupid let's just call it pc game pass that's hard to do most companies
mels/006949.pt|we all at once and i appreciate i really do appreciate the
mels/012677.pt|isn't that the worst thing wow could do
mels/024092.pt|it's lane gives me extra beans what if you cannot afford a car they literally just
mels/030773.pt|the god and god is forcing my hand
mels/011979.pt|they want to be good guys like the vast majority of the ship is like obviously they're booing this guy and they want to be
mels/003429.pt|one china policy we don't talk about it and we don't really push it they don't push it and nothing happens and
mels/029914.pt|i remember we were driving up to norcal
mels/003002.pt|well the stairs and she she motions to her friend
mels/011910.pt|off the bat we're eating like the first meal
mels/004920.pt|do you have started to leave so they were all imagining a world where
mels/000264.pt|just how insane of a baller ludwig is now and i do i really appreciate it
mels/004579.pt|wait for szechuan sauce you guys are the same so here we go
mels/023605.pt|and then someone found the receipts caught
mels/019352.pt|but really this moment shines through we lost
mels/001876.pt|logged out like incognito just to see
mels/027568.pt|i heard about it and so a lot
mels/025650.pt|i do have a fail for a couple
mels/015694.pt|as i know a lot that i couldn't fit into this
mels/012289.pt|it's it's it's cool you know it feels
mels/028190.pt|the moment with rap respect your elders
mels/028279.pt|with my life that's a judge of character that guy's a
mels/011824.pt|when you get on they they turn your
mels/014215.pt|i cannot read every sub while i'm doing
mels/030436.pt|we recently and that was only like a day after so i literally
mels/012441.pt|we should switch sides because the only person i've been
mels/004632.pt|it's still up over the past five years but it's down right now but back when it was up i would get these cold calls all the time from wealth managers they just called every single nvidia employee and they're like hey
mels/019541.pt|is this is not an s
mels/030488.pt|at the time it's a great night appetizer comes
mels/016929.pt|actually an alternative energies uh sponsor of
mels/005610.pt|lied about it lied about it a bunch
mels/030287.pt|the judge products based on results i should be thanking him because it was literally the best shampoo i've ever had my hair looked so bouncy and boisterous and shiny it was fantastic on the low if it wasn't so shamed by society i would go buy some
mels/023606.pt|out of control why pop's former good girl is suddenly
mels/029349.pt|or whatever and he's like let's all go all right and i'm like cool cool and i'm like assuming in my mind he's
mels/008117.pt|psychic actually decided that he's going to take the amount of subs that you owe
mels/007831.pt|and then i just put them all together and
mels/016064.pt|where are you afraid to say it out loud because it was
mels/007441.pt|and no one wants to give them up anyway we'll see we'll see what the
mels/001834.pt|i get this and so like rich architects and people are are
mels/008036.pt|such a bigger launch on on twitch and youtube than any other
mels/019712.pt|okay i'll do the fail first because it's
mels/018135.pt|it's because they can't get their pepsi
mels/026963.pt|probably while alone we are meta that is literally the concept for this incredibly strange
mels/009656.pt|ways we can still win and everyone else like doesn't want to tell ways we can still win and everyone else is like doesn't want to tell him dude it's
mels/028976.pt|or i got the more that gummy bear started to look good to
mels/027627.pt|or he'll find out about how efficiently the chinese state can gobble up that tesla
mels/004911.pt|or payday for each share we owned it's an
mels/021500.pt|back to zero this is not going to
mels/022163.pt|it's a good ad i mean it's it's a good way of
mels/021436.pt|i never believed in this even though i i truly support the general idea of you know
mels/007976.pt|the for the first time a spectacular
mels/004449.pt|or it could be a six days late marketing
mels/019247.pt|yeah I'd be watching a movie in a
mels/031258.pt|from the street and there's a there's a door on the side of
mels/018685.pt|the xbox series s and the
mels/012618.pt|when i showed up and they
mels/018973.pt|they thought they could do better they thought hey this stuff's all too long let's make stuff like this we'll put
mels/013919.pt|or buy now pay later by the way if you don't know about
mels/009956.pt|your wedding why why would i do that i want the wedding to go well i don't want someone
mels/022923.pt|one this idea and not a single one can
mels/012650.pt|is there anything else you want to say about the trip or like
mels/026029.pt|in an ironic one something might have gone wrong in
mels/028153.pt|get that it means they cannot pay their bills which means
mels/025278.pt|you can see the crown a very popular show mandalorian
mels/022124.pt|these twitter accounts have no other purpose in the
mels/004463.pt|in the good way or cold like the food is cold because it's
mels/002359.pt|let me write that down wedding guest
mels/031775.pt|yes sir and contribute a little bit of the uh storyline that we can kind of dig
mels/008213.pt|if i want to get all political on you is that
mels/022711.pt|starting with microsoft buying nokia in
mels/029038.pt|and that's where i know we're fighting okay so he's
mels/000047.pt|with the nine months waffle surfing the
mels/009332.pt|the ingredients of feast chocolate liqueur
mels/011636.pt|pretty recently and i thought for two days
mels/000265.pt|it is nice but i i hope he understands that if he had no money i would still the
mels/017900.pt|please hurry i'm hurting real bad you're
mels/016181.pt|interesting smart forward thinking forward thinking i like that you know you
mels/018029.pt|worry the mystery of pepsi man
mels/026240.pt|and often they lead you to spend now
mels/023858.pt|back off and they went back to the original
mels/020394.pt|well each other the present yeah that sounds really
mels/002227.pt|get options on the pizza on the free pizza or something like that it was
mels/017539.pt|the highest valuation for a company in human history there are a few possible edge cases the dutch east india company was worth
mels/018498.pt|this is a flex this is
mels/014353.pt|in music or anything they want
mels/020534.pt|is zero this is at the bottom season one season
mels/012386.pt|i remember i was in line for food next to a kid and i i like glanced at his data pad and he was like messaging
mels/003728.pt|fall but it's it's it's not that it's uh
mels/016745.pt|way to make meat sustainable is like the best
mels/022964.pt|i this okay this is more realistic
mels/016897.pt|keeps going up you know what i'm saying if you
mels/010923.pt|are you a little a little
mels/010355.pt|i guess that tracks i guess that tracks
mels/008335.pt|i guess i'm encouraged that people didn't just like take it lying down i
mels/032306.pt|where you beat them without getting hit once how beautiful is that how beautiful is that okay now my personal opinion is that it's not
mels/019021.pt|is not going on a talk show or being in a movie you can be famous through essentially static images and that's easy to do you can make a
mels/031186.pt|it had a lot of stuff that's just a hard thing to do and i think the stuff he did around
mels/016384.pt|williams of dollars printed and sent to the wrong people that
mels/014196.pt|this is a big cap because facebook
mels/016800.pt|as it's not necessarily like middle classes we'd think of it but
mels/024367.pt|i close the next ad is more than the
mels/026140.pt|okay what i want is i mean this could
mels/012753.pt|in korea china he had more
mels/007405.pt|a ton of my negative associations with the scene vanished when i hang out with real life
mels/004974.pt|it just doesn't look good when this
mels/015082.pt|a big part of the business netflix actually made more money even when streaming was like this era they made more money from dvd rentals
mels/014186.pt|cause they think that they've 100
mels/029318.pt|and they're wearing they're wearing nice business casual
mels/017994.pt|yeah i i i don't know how it's
mels/021215.pt|on this and that is why if disney had just stuck
mels/022634.pt|in this screen i'm actually in a game of
mels/003580.pt|something has to change because the price of goods and
mels/009979.pt|we time he literally thinks that this scene after this scene he's in right this is the this is the sketch that gets
mels/007048.pt|it is one day before hitler which is not great not not perfect but not the same day tim curry
mels/011771.pt|a joke and then she points out somebody and
mels/027803.pt|by printing a bunch of money surprise surprise it actually worked but it's like you're feeling depressed so you take
mels/010214.pt|as i wouldn't be talking to you um and
mels/002348.pt|that's just hours you could have gotten there's really no getting around it
mels/001985.pt|because you only have to hire like one or two employees you don't need a lot of real estate for the shop and you don't need to
mels/006323.pt|you think i should get involved
mels/018605.pt|in a sony game pass or a bundle or a uh or their cloud service no never
mels/021694.pt|we can't give you back those 30 seconds
mels/018683.pt|let's just put a picture of ninja in here this will help you guys understand what's going on they paid a lot of money to buy mixer and they paid even more money to get ninja and before the next console's even out
mels/027429.pt|there is apparently an organization called the american property owners alliance which is essentially rich landlords and they spend money on twitter ads to try and convince people that
mels/031249.pt|walking the streets of atlanta at night
mels/016298.pt|it's the three g's of life
mels/032014.pt|he would bail on everything with the with the excuse that he's too busy it would always be oh it's the kid
mels/019385.pt|let me be clear that there were no threats to enron
mels/006598.pt|so anyway that's a big win to sony
mels/022740.pt|motorola and they said all right seven billion for a phone company that's that's chump change all right we're
mels/023129.pt|what if we can get people to eat them and so they
mels/004558.pt|ask you to do and that is dive yourself
mels/018313.pt|marketing monday hey truck do you invest
mels/014284.pt|that are tough to fill quickly by new content
mels/012144.pt|you and she's like incredibly nice
mels/013930.pt|the biggest fears that is more than the number of people in that age group that are afraid of war or death they are more afraid of credit card debt than dying as a generation okay and so but they still want to buy things they would still like to buy things and so buy now pay later has been an attractive
mels/015702.pt|it can be writing off than you do
mels/015136.pt|better club for golfers okay your total addressable market is all
mels/013716.pt|i look at what this guy did and in every other game for the dawn of time
mels/021132.pt|then i then i think it's
mels/005097.pt|the for your viewing pleasure so let's check out
mels/026428.pt|the audience and that can work but i think
mels/012726.pt|the school runescape but just runescape
mels/028204.pt|after it we get back to twitch and there's this thought like wow that tournament did really well but what a pain in the ass for twitch we didn't know
mels/015039.pt|more than now to get dvds delivered
mels/010629.pt|the jungler this is the red buff
mels/024028.pt|the fitness stuff and the cooking
mels/032056.pt|that d1 would buy these huge hotels
mels/005381.pt|in your nails done in life check
mels/027319.pt|i could never match but i think this is a huge part of some of the core rabid fans that have built the enduring brand of dark souls and i think to remove that capability would remove these fans and remove their ability to help spread this message
mels/015810.pt|of dying and they're having trouble growing but
mels/028101.pt|to give one more and that is so uh
mels/024275.pt|they just throw in this random singing scene that's
mels/004659.pt|at the chill at home and stream so it should
mels/027252.pt|the real money in their store to get the
mels/015321.pt|and you're using one day shipping that is important to them and they'll give you
mels/030954.pt|well the words better than me
mels/028146.pt|if the thing to say but i think in 2022 we
mels/017531.pt|are you today is that it's a very weakening and less and less important part of the picture
mels/000276.pt|and so the casino had offered to comp him a room if he was
mels/029125.pt|the praise it you can see it at my logs i go into the little the channel mike the praise it you can see it in my logs i go into the
mels/018887.pt|is where my favorite streams to do I love
mels/023826.pt|hell yeah said i'm not leaving without a
mels/000604.pt|that show that was awesome i
mels/029556.pt|era was riding high on smash fever
mels/028889.pt|i'm not drunk right now yeah i had
mels/006790.pt|i will say this uh i texted j
mels/016573.pt|cyber security is getting more and more and more important it's an exponential increase because the risk of getting hacked is now incredibly high and the damage is incredibly bad for your company and so companies are getting more and more scared about
mels/024406.pt|that makes you think wow i'm in a real living breathing world and that's why when i saw this footage from the latest
mels/012417.pt|i wish i had the video
mels/026250.pt|private corporation there is no company that has out valued apple at 3 trillion
mels/004620.pt|that of course i obviously can't tell you a happy birthday it wouldn't be fair to the shareholders of
mels/021299.pt|i mean general okay it's been very good and so what does that mean
mels/027635.pt|so i was wondering how did he get this money like how did he how did he get the
mels/031665.pt|we're talking about it the the word was
mels/032029.pt|called you the logan paul with
mels/030932.pt|while the wall i'm sure they fixed it instantly but i definitely moved it over
mels/021847.pt|in the first amazon office attempting to become a twitch streamer but he was a
mels/026666.pt|be the future of blizzard it's
mels/026695.pt|how bobby kodak finds these deals
mels/019513.pt|was so successful that it actually
mels/019778.pt|if you watch what they were talking about at
mels/014092.pt|with drake and the world changed changed forever and all
mels/000036.pt|jesus christ speak english i'm canadian i never heard that yeah i
mels/010756.pt|give us one question from that exam and chat will all collectively give you an answer yeah and then one
mels/002412.pt|nah nah i'll take it now you guys don't get that one yeah you have enough to
mels/027579.pt|we closely at twitter's financials start to
mels/025368.pt|i have your best shot but i was like yeah i mean i did say yes i didn't i didn't
mels/023466.pt|i better than the other there's just no other way to
mels/007605.pt|start lying okay if i start meeting my editors in person
mels/011193.pt|i would let me tell you
mels/027622.pt|right person to say this because amazon has bowed to the same pressures specifically they partnered with
mels/028424.pt|and when i was let's say i must have been
mels/031943.pt|and i remember there was that thing
mels/029515.pt|and maybe they squeak one out maybe they
mels/023269.pt|i did different bottles and tap water and i put them all
mels/000075.pt|it was like building something for aatrox
mels/028892.pt|my roommate diego told me this i try to dance with her and apparently my move was i kept picking her up and spitting her around like just like spinning like not dancing at all and like maybe one time that's funny but apparently like i did it a bunch of times like i would go around the party and then i would run back into her again
mels/030151.pt|rolled and smoked him i want you guys to know literally i'm still high because i rolled and smoked him
mels/007970.pt|and marketing money it's a full complete
mels/020424.pt|it's so simple humble beginnings indeed humble beginnings this is an example of every every pepsi
mels/013793.pt|at a human in real life that is so
mels/008778.pt|just like there's just not a lot uh
mels/029194.pt|yeah it was just such a cool time to be at twitch because like this was the
mels/021767.pt|to do some people have been interested in did you see people have been interested
mels/016495.pt|you know let's say an average idiot who
mels/014693.pt|hey you build a server you
mels/003169.pt|a lot of money and nothing's really happened from it yet and then the third big problem is
mels/030837.pt|too much about my stream now my co-workers know far too much about my
mels/009886.pt|about new zealand is that apparently it's like the perfect place if the world collapses like if if everything truly collapses new zealand is like the most insulated from like violence it's got like sustainable
mels/013184.pt|in arizona so when you say i am too i know that you're lying we all make
mels/021713.pt|we're at the end which our brains automatically tune out it doesn't make you think
mels/000949.pt|and like i told the people like contract signed i'm
mels/017072.pt|when he was sad it was
mels/003195.pt|it's the pharmaceutical executive who started a ponzi scheme and jacked up the price of drugs martin shkreli he also bought i believe the nft copy of the
mels/002393.pt|if the play it for many many many hours and i'd rather just jump in so i can do
mels/018856.pt|it was before he got cut
mels/026648.pt|and if you're interested in investing in activision blizzard stock because it's
mels/015749.pt|they're getting real flexible with the math because a lot of them had early good starts paramount plus
mels/014655.pt|get the jpl wednesday for the
mels/000218.pt|i didn't i mean i didn't i didn't
mels/031829.pt|you're joking oh my god what
mels/022822.pt|we should buy you you're a scam but instead they said
mels/017247.pt|okay because today unfortunately our justice system found elizabeth holmes guilty what happened to this country okay if you can't drop out of stanford at age
mels/016032.pt|it's worth the money it's and it's sick of them to sponsor marketing monday and i it's worth of money it's um
mels/008820.pt|and there's a lot of people that believe that if he just goes back to basics and
mels/009021.pt|right now what did i do one year ago today today is july
mels/025448.pt|almost daring capitalism to stop him and i would like to give a a salute
mels/008758.pt|it and then you get pulled out on so
mels/001555.pt|i shouldn't even though you did answer it quite well i will give you one more bonus question now let me think here
mels/015555.pt|they wanna hang out with celebrities they want to make shows everyone else is doing it they have the money it doesn't cost them anything
mels/020000.pt|pick up a football and watch
mels/025127.pt|just depressing okay i'm not i don't want
mels/027126.pt|the first year of it it's like everything's on crack and that's why we
mels/016261.pt|this is so dirty to malik monk
mels/026157.pt|if you guys know marketing monday you may know that i put out one of my favorite marketing mondays ever
mels/016172.pt|you know so i figured i might as well keep
mels/024476.pt|you've completely it has left no memorable
mels/000275.pt|the big poker streamer event and he had gambled a bunch like
mels/012901.pt|that was the best i mean that changed everything
mels/029302.pt|i help you out i wanna see
mels/028454.pt|with the office and i'm just sitting there on the floor
mels/008466.pt|or day at the office not my longest sub
mels/006713.pt|i showed my dog who's named maya on the
mels/009179.pt|bothered by swings in live viewership mostly because i've noticed over
mels/029956.pt|what already he didn't raid i think he saw i think he
mels/031045.pt|black mold i pity the person that got that apartment after me because they paid three times the rent
mels/017233.pt|you're off right with some terrible brand tweets
mels/015947.pt|and the competition is fierce why would you
mels/021949.pt|and i i like stressed about it and i was like what what's the difference
mels/006465.pt|indicator that could have been used to figure out if
mels/004947.pt|they were already losing 200 million
mels/024658.pt|one of the biggest um investment
mels/026024.pt|i can get three free months of mint
mels/004586.pt|it's got here yeah that's what i did that's what
mels/030767.pt|that's so sweet but why do you think i'd
mels/017136.pt|we actually just jump in here pretty soon i think in
mels/017200.pt|and uh and it was way worse
mels/005157.pt|she did as good a job as she could do i think based on also
mels/023722.pt|i would just want to include
mels/010955.pt|let's see okay you see this and that way i need to get
mels/017637.pt|an apple store costs about nine million
mels/025011.pt|so what the united states you know what i
mels/014052.pt|who moves faster than entire teams of development people that i've seen just so much faster
mels/031059.pt|in the through the phone and i thought he was based on his voice and his jokes i thought he was really weird and i thought he
mels/005219.pt|he didn't personally do that people did
mels/016387.pt|the that went to businesses that
mels/001165.pt|so unhealthy factor the reason i like it and i've tried every single one and i've ordered
mels/006048.pt|he said bro i can't wait to pump
mels/030984.pt|in stereotype literally his name was vladimir i'm not kidding
mels/026594.pt|ninja oh let me give you a win okay
mels/027856.pt|well bunch of like financial trickery and algorithm trickery that doesn't actually work when
mels/010852.pt|like saying hey i don't really wanna like playing you mean a
mels/010358.pt|the the toast the tried and true we're going to play four
mels/017096.pt|always a critic i guess i
mels/010659.pt|so and then we played some games super fun i'm very excited we have a great team it's me mango
mels/010373.pt|in the tank have you seen the newest
mels/024750.pt|that marketers and game designers use to
mels/026609.pt|i know because i've worked with ludwig
mels/030861.pt|i can't i can't i can't with this kid i can't with this kid he's like
mels/018527.pt|let's talk about some of the main things people are saying number one is they're saying oh well i heard that the games won't be exclusive let me be very clear bethesda games aaa games going forward are very very likely to not come out on
mels/032111.pt|and he goes oh i get
mels/016981.pt|i got a book i just finished that other book about the depression it was pretty
mels/023185.pt|iraq because i get all the money oh also one more thing if you are feeling depressed consider buying like a value meal because the great value from a place like mcdonald's or burger king will make you feel a lot better can we give it up
mels/009525.pt|they mess up the positioning knowing where to be knowing to watch the mini-map knowing how to get to fights on
mels/001457.pt|what's your exact address uh okay you live in america
mels/020330.pt|it's a very convincing ad of the benefits i would
mels/017485.pt|well this trend because there's been a pretty much
mels/030378.pt|that i go in a different line from her okay
mels/021724.pt|experts read the comments let me see the massive plow differently beam because chick traditionally trap
mels/025863.pt|same thing for hearthstone but when toast try to do it they said no only if you've never played hearthstone will we pay you if we've already got you playing hearthstone you to get shit same thing for hearthstone but when toast tried to do it they said no only if you've never played hearthstone will we pay you
mels/013150.pt|and i was trying to do it yeah if it works for
mels/005220.pt|do that but it was it wasn't uh it didn't it didn't reach
mels/021454.pt|apple is the most valuable company on earth there's just more shares of apple look at berkshire hathaway
mels/001922.pt|i love my job i think it's rare i think it's very rare to find a job where i feel
mels/029491.pt|but maybe people got hype over his gameplay at least maybe he's got that yeah
mels/012377.pt|kind of cool to be like going to a bar and like trying to get a secret code from
mels/003843.pt|at the party that couches you know
mels/014156.pt|or take deals that are less than
mels/029331.pt|the guy he's like look he even got
mels/019781.pt|is that we normally on they added things scripted that
mels/028208.pt|we're looking forward in general but after the venue after this whole event they were like it was imperative it was like an urgent there was urgency to it okay blur got on the list
mels/008462.pt|equal parts insightful and hilarious cooper loop
mels/010398.pt|the fair and reliable good internet
mels/010586.pt|is it effective are you still doing it it's crazy because only one person
mels/023040.pt|the changes let me give you
mels/009583.pt|but you're right right right right right i forgot
mels/014365.pt|the a foothold rather than just hardcore
mels/024932.pt|don't get people to pay for pay you because there's no reason to so make sure grinding and paying are legitimate versions of progressing
mels/001600.pt|like people have been trying them and enjoying them and i think i think if it's not a fight like if it's within what makes sense for your finances um i
mels/009808.pt|it's not so interesting when you live in
mels/018427.pt|we'll have to buy the games you have to buy this service and
mels/006742.pt|the percent that cares even smaller that being said during the sun's game
mels/012368.pt|so like you'd be like hey we need to you know ari
mels/008638.pt|actually they're going to do it but we'll see
mels/029083.pt|and the answer is i was going to everyone who was an early
mels/019033.pt|you need she also talks about you know before
mels/014664.pt|yeah i'm eating kale chips that ari made
mels/031936.pt|and eventually even i'm like okay we've been
mels/000556.pt|there are expensive they're expensive watches
mels/021075.pt|very rare in an ad yeah it's good it also you
mels/011773.pt|which if you know anything about star
mels/031425.pt|with this and we got competitive with bocce
mels/004310.pt|how's everything going hey good to see
mels/013335.pt|it's a story of waste i had this idea for marketing monday that involved i can't explain why because i might still do a
mels/027595.pt|cause he'll make improvements to it and he is a good man but
mels/020854.pt|what does that tell you it's not about the learning though it's about growing and learning on circles and ideas
mels/011704.pt|disneyland in orlando and the uber driver would not drive us there and she didn't speak english she was like no staff entrance so we're like
mels/014569.pt|one feature ever just just invest the money just do it right i know it's hard i know it's technically difficult but like the rewards are there just do it right now they did there's like a button you can press like it's near clips or something is it gone they got rid of it
mels/010303.pt|i don't think it'll work so
mels/021752.pt|which business has been real good to me but now i got this
mels/031284.pt|but he asked me how i got in i tell him the truth i tell
mels/012898.pt|because winning that ticket allowed me
mels/017625.pt|please revolutionized this part of the clock the purchase part of the clock
mels/013179.pt|i can't show it on stream i'll
mels/012340.pt|they don't make any sense it
mels/002318.pt|how does he even have that oh you
mels/016523.pt|one every tournament in every game
mels/030657.pt|if everyone's in the auditorium now now it was like sudden death when it got to the final two it was like the first one to get a question wrong if the other person gets it right is eliminated they start ask you to hard question after if everyone's in the auditorium now now it was like sudden death when it got to the final two it was like the first one to get a question wrong if the other person gets it right is eliminated they start asking hard question after hard question
mels/029112.pt|as we are there as we are in tahoe twitch facebook one starts to happen
mels/009802.pt|could fall by as much as 50
mels/030003.pt|one month you've got like a bunch of eight
mels/025828.pt|what do you guys think this graph is this is a graph of
mels/008382.pt|because i want to do today obviously i want to talk about what the
mels/001385.pt|wait guess it could be i'm gonna guess abraham
mels/029290.pt|and i drove from colorado to california to try and make it in esports
mels/026332.pt|or in-person purchase experience and this
mels/005889.pt|the of comparison he thought he was the first person to think of the i'm the michael jordan of
mels/025064.pt|we used to make nestle chocolate is often the product of child labor and abuse over a 12 month period water pollution
mels/020018.pt|women of all time because he's way easier to
mels/022395.pt|worry this ad is so good and the humanity of it is so good
mels/000111.pt|my wedding i like linkus and he said some
mels/024556.pt|because apple does not want their biggest apps pushing you to the web to to get rid of the cut but here's the
mels/019484.pt|people are actually able to skip over
mels/030125.pt|most everything so it was like just not very fun overall
mels/031875.pt|the rise of riot games again league

mels/013829.pt|this guy lol sorry for what xbox is barely clean at twenty
mels/007573.pt|but overall i'll say it was a good time it was a good time and uh i did enjoy
mels/010313.pt|sleepy joe is cracked on the sticks well i don't think i should call
mels/019761.pt|well a little bit before we begin about why this stuff happens it's
mels/012844.pt|like the lowest point of my whole life
mels/024194.pt|the of their own and uh right
mels/031898.pt|at the jetty over the garage jenny

mels/022734.pt|the fired money lost left and right no phone

mels/028065.pt|a cd player i really don't know what
mels/004887.pt|billionaire friendly he's the richest man on earth he has a lot of power behind him to possibly make this a reality but it's not infinite and i i find it hard to believe he will be able to get out of this twitter deal without a significant financial harm
mels/024588.pt|will shape the future of business dynamics yeah that's kind of interesting but what's more important was the secret trial the secret undercurrent of a trial
mels/029089.pt|like aviators and that was gonna be my
mels/003501.pt|in america but the bill was only 50 billion dollars
mels/020298.pt|if the parents it should be like the snowman doing this

mels/016984.pt|actually it was pretty interesting but i want to
mels/011152.pt|yeah no i feel that i feel that you cannot right click save a physical

mels/009492.pt|that's something that can just be
mels/003490.pt|like yesterday and i'd already picked
mels/030043.pt|marketing monday really taking off damn
mels/031375.pt|palace bro and we go in there and it's just like pure modern art you know the kind of like the art on the wall looks like just like imagine this everywhere
mels/013326.pt|wait what would you change about it i think it's time to
mels/004567.pt|tweets before then which i'm sure we can
mels/023304.pt|like doubling down or getting angry or trying to change things they literally just said everyone is entitled to their drink preferences everyone has different tastes and needs players are offered water and coke
mels/017232.pt|anyway i just thought that was a you know we're
mels/027163.pt|is worthless and so we're running into a situation where
mels/018332.pt|there's a company about to go public
mels/024978.pt|finland hates ferrari i guess they are kind of like
mels/015546.pt|they don't really care about the content the
mels/014230.pt|they get immersed in the culture on here this
mels/006005.pt|did i literally thought you were you were
mels/014958.pt|as a streamer i could necessarily deduct
mels/026199.pt|there's nothing to get about i'm
mels/008340.pt|i turned into a joke and then you don't get your real answer are you
mels/027561.pt|worry financially impossible to even know what you had to spend and to get ready to buy
mels/023119.pt|is the indian name for corn and call it maize syrup
mels/025812.pt|of these companies was sued by the state of california for a culture of sexual harassment one of these companies was also deeply tied to china
mels/017156.pt|you can just say mid by the way i don't need to know that it's high key
mels/031868.pt|it's a different kind of purple i guess it's kind of what is what is the
mels/032164.pt|the casinos only win because they expect
mels/001880.pt|while visionaries he invited me on
mels/002852.pt|the court they basically don't care about the politics of it they don't care about the spectacle of it they don't care about
mels/006880.pt|watch this story but one of the senior vps i was sitting down next to him at evo at a blackjack table
mels/030870.pt|where i the uncle iro but young
mels/003100.pt|and but guess who's not feeling this
mels/031671.pt|that was kind of cool actually
mels/030687.pt|at the moment all right so by the way we made a big
mels/018824.pt|this is pretty forgettable right this is very
mels/020800.pt|if the games though i'll tell you that
mels/030519.pt|oh yeah we did the parents stuff is father
mels/023135.pt|you about the source of those tasty delicious luxury treats the dolphin fish this is a perfectly innocuous name and in fact this fish has nothing to
mels/021663.pt|they got an extremely likable spokesman they put their brand everywhere they realized everyone's kind
mels/018067.pt|are you saying pepsi man uses coke are you saying pepsi man uses coke i'm saying
mels/019900.pt|i was wondering i was like why did you guys
mels/020572.pt|who are on their 50th cup of coffee
mels/029506.pt|if you're absolutely right that would have been that
mels/002180.pt|die percent of what i thought would be helpful going in wasn't it didn't
mels/009170.pt|we get incentivized and then when you get a 10
mels/010987.pt|yo yo honestly check this out
mels/024181.pt|because i can ride or die
mels/030739.pt|i don't mess with the little dubs
mels/027544.pt|with a lot more money and there's two reasons one is that you think the management is doing such a good job that this will naturally go up
mels/026316.pt|in sell at the scale they do at the prices they
mels/012299.pt|it's not your own money they put in anyway she
mels/005205.pt|skips or lag and i said no i said give me the give me the lag give me
mels/029355.pt|carl's jr to treat myself i'm surprised
mels/029037.pt|and i go spinning backwards like he
mels/027504.pt|i can give you a quick breakdown on how we
mels/004616.pt|i think i just ignored that one you're telling me elon musk
mels/003044.pt|i mean they did at least they responded i get the fact that it's the wrong feeder is kind of bad but they definitely took it seriously there was a lot of people there
mels/024768.pt|i do this is because once you've put in
mels/004545.pt|for you and he's like are you sure like i
mels/010298.pt|but i just don't know him and i have no in with him i have no contact
mels/020484.pt|this is the game that really
mels/011560.pt|i haven't watched the new batman i was
mels/028365.pt|it's the true north here and it's basically what a compass does
mels/006015.pt|really surprised and impressed because yeah
mels/005557.pt|i drove because i had i had
mels/006887.pt|free food three times a day giant wall of every drink you could
mels/000702.pt|i don't want to leak his last name but
mels/001468.pt|i would have accepted the queen even though that's not doesn't really
mels/018819.pt|is it's an incredibly pretentious next Bud
mels/003349.pt|and it was kind of buried but he basically said that around six weeks ago they started to see an uptick
mels/014206.pt|well if you encounter video is way bigger
mels/032068.pt|not want anyone to pull a mizzy and bloor was the only
mels/022855.pt|the moon they looked at all of his history
mels/020543.pt|working triple time just to get this part back to to
mels/029231.pt|what yeah just like stand there and like pull the curtain open and then he walks out onto the stage okay and then
mels/000750.pt|i've been just streaming and working and they just
mels/021534.pt|going to be like all the poor people
mels/032323.pt|do a whole rant about the holonet community
mels/027507.pt|i mean look this is the peak is rather it launched
mels/001980.pt|it's interesting because you know remember how
mels/007699.pt|put you in a box and you're
mels/030439.pt|it all right so this is important because you
mels/017677.pt|stuff has gotten they've clearly stolen
mels/024702.pt|i never having made a single car and most of that was from western investors people in america canada europe buying in thinking that this was a great idea china electric vehicles let's go they bought in it's worth nothing they
mels/021194.pt|many years ago is about to become coming back in a massive way because as people are sad and lonely nostalgia marketing rises like crazy nostalgic marketing is a tried and true way to remind you of when times were better when times are scary and sad we've already remade all
mels/031678.pt|and then ever since then i played more league
mels/016545.pt|increasing in scope and so there's potential and opportunity where another
mels/002375.pt|thank you very inspirational for our investment strategies
mels/030854.pt|well played jigglypuff got nearly four
mels/018619.pt|okay so netflix got a huge advantage
mels/014793.pt|i think yeah yeah i need to move this over here i think
mels/013747.pt|what the excuses to sell his own stock above a
mels/022441.pt|and it was entirely from this green bubbles and blue bubbles
mels/014894.pt|now i think that's it i don't want to do too many more i did want to give one more let's see
mels/022978.pt|like the pretty lady who greets you with a lay
mels/021039.pt|first of all i think we
mels/022808.pt|that's a business model that could never
mels/000764.pt|in the street that are like and the car billboards that are like for sex workers it's like for escorts or for like
mels/024198.pt|well he hurt us or do we just lose a couple of his
mels/016189.pt|what kind of eyelash extensions do you use
mels/019699.pt|it was awesome please following peter scott
mels/022939.pt|this is also very subtle at the end i don't think i've if you guys don't know epic also does unreal engine which is where a lot of games are based off of a lot of games are built on the unreal engine they suddenly say
mels/017975.pt|if you guys don't know there's a leak
mels/021960.pt|in real life is you find a goal what's
mels/016601.pt|trying to do it's a it's just a tailwind behind
mels/020759.pt|hopefully getting you broken up into
mels/024228.pt|pedigree so let's start with this
mels/016896.pt|are what twitch has made dumb decisions
mels/008580.pt|but it's a bit of a beater like it's not
mels/001573.pt|let's see i'm gonna pull up rand
mels/030998.pt|well apartments were getting so pissed that there was an article about landlords that were secretly burning their own apartments down to get the tenants out so they could rebuild
mels/023653.pt|there'll be a different kid and they look up at the sky
mels/015226.pt|whether the maybe just an american one and that has proven itself out with
mels/013397.pt|let's see we have a lot of
mels/030665.pt|i know how to pronounce it i've been saying bicycle but at the time
mels/002008.pt|that like i like everything but the boba you know just take the boba out and i love it it's like the
mels/019325.pt|these three girls who wanted to be apples so bad
mels/023157.pt|i twitter fingers you know this burger looks pretty delicious right i think
mels/030786.pt|do you mean by i'm drake
mels/001504.pt|the delicious nutritious meals at factor thank god for factor
mels/016287.pt|is out here like you know what we don't care crunch
mels/007752.pt|but then i'm not particularly fast right i'm just
mels/026784.pt|what the positive snowball effects that are one of the reasons that
mels/016426.pt|a little bit angry about this i think it's really really
mels/031987.pt|the weekend and then the weekday they go back and kiss susie during the school shooter
mels/020701.pt|not only that but at least in the commercial you see the process you get the idea
mels/008263.pt|it's very very cool and he'll
mels/012136.pt|we problem was i guess they didn't expect for couples that were in the same room to have different to do different things because this this happened so you have your little droid i told you about
mels/018329.pt|we acquire the startup so they can go instantly public what i think is happening is all the money is being made in that
mels/010338.pt|i don't think that's a leak
mels/019335.pt|people who want a cheap laptop just the watch anything this was our presentation we had to give to the whole class and this presentation was very contentious for reasons you will soon see people were not clapping at the end of people who want a cheap laptop just to watch anything this was our presentation we had to give to the whole class and this presentation was very
mels/001161.pt|like it's actually good uh it it's like
mels/023068.pt|it's on food annually it's seven
mels/001697.pt|he's a bad influence on charlie for several years the meme remained a niche internet curiosity like can you believe that some people hate the character you're obviously supposed to like but the idea skyrockets in popularity after
mels/002906.pt|charge that will show up if you are
mels/021639.pt|i think this brought it home literally i think they know what they're doing this is a solid if not great ad did you know that norway
mels/015326.pt|true story and so to hedge their bets because the boss is asking they didn't just go for one they went for two and they spent a billion dollars alone on lord of the rings then they
mels/030276.pt|in direct marketing on this bottle it was so easy to get confused you know having one friend make fun of you is one thing you
mels/003140.pt|i know you guys all follow her religiously
mels/010797.pt|on twitch and and discord and everything so it they can spend hundreds of millions on it
mels/025580.pt|and favorite arizona sunshine i love arizona sunshine that game basically got me and
mels/025487.pt|which speculation this guy went on and tried to pump
mels/024184.pt|i sub split and if they don't do it i'm
mels/009814.pt|i'm sure that it will all work out fine
mels/020283.pt|well he just did it for other goodness of his heart they got the real santa to come down and
mels/030190.pt|can't get up and so we're both trying to
mels/022005.pt|the kitchen and then twist it
mels/017671.pt|are packaging to what it would look like if microsoft
mels/003194.pt|listen i know you guys don't have the greatest
mels/005408.pt|make something like that because it's like it's not just one and done it feels like it
mels/000027.pt|i guess they'll give you a discount for making them laugh yeah coke dealers are notorious for for being easy going when the
mels/001846.pt|return to the grind uh no no no no
mels/007284.pt|oh recreation i had to recreate the
mels/008275.pt|good that was so cool so
mels/022101.pt|it's more now obviously people got really upset so they doubled down
mels/002977.pt|and i thought it was the most brilliant stunt of all time i thought it was like
mels/013994.pt|at any stage of that process
mels/023182.pt|get a little nervous in front of crowds like this i don't know if you can relate so i'm going to give it back to
mels/021748.pt|we as don't know my history with jimmy john's
mels/011494.pt|the joker wasn't a pleasant or good movie i got
mels/023009.pt|that's essentially what happened apple is so big that even fortnite in the height of
mels/019542.pt|oh better than the harvey's one and i just can't so bite bite sip sip
mels/012496.pt|it was kind of short 5k
mels/023704.pt|for you this is predatory obviously but at some point
mels/028758.pt|in downtown san francisco which is essentially poverty wages and i not only did i not negotiate
mels/010656.pt|like confirming in a real game that i listen to what he was showing on the
mels/025359.pt|i pulled up my social media and they went like tweet by tweet looking for anything wrong in my history they went through my entire like media history in front of me to see if
mels/016773.pt|if the for our demographics so
mels/030860.pt|i kicked him i kicked him i kicked him i
mels/018402.pt|what you gloss so quickly i wanted to see
mels/023080.pt|equivalent every three years at retail price okay so you must be really hardcore
mels/017239.pt|what the campaign and the fact they thought the best way to deliver that campaign on social was
mels/029871.pt|for people in chat who don't know
mels/017091.pt|from nvidia this is a loner laptop they have stickers on it so you know
mels/021326.pt|trends that are a little bit sad okay
mels/002676.pt|ten dollars added up i need a little music for this i need a little
mels/027589.pt|to a little bit more because when you actually read his statements
mels/009084.pt|not for at least two hours
mels/022786.pt|are you so they bought countrywide for two billion dollars and that seems cheap at the time everyone's like wow what a great deal why was countrywide willing to sell for only two billion they're making money hand over fist two billion dollars is nothing this is a great deal for most
mels/023769.pt|in the devito let's find out i've had three people try to eat me
mels/032168.pt|or money so i go to lud who's got a pretty decent
mels/016375.pt|i did seven applications last night and
mels/011920.pt|about just doing luxury stuff it's like about a
mels/002328.pt|watch watching we're going to do
mels/003232.pt|as two years was yeah it was a lie
mels/022748.pt|they went to samsung and lg and begged them to make their phones for them and
mels/030274.pt|i gotta say i'm not gonna lie to you
mels/018432.pt|because it has the best tech the reason
mels/028452.pt|no chips all right this is chekhov's gun yes this is chekhov's gun in screenwriting
mels/002812.pt|the lifestyles or the fact that elon musk had sex with his wife but something happened in the past few months that have caused these two titans of industry to drift apart insane that while he was simultaneously impregnating a
mels/021453.pt|walker works at all okay the price is only comparable to the to its own stock
mels/017352.pt|i could not possibly cringe any harder midlife crisis without saying midlife crisis
mels/014981.pt|i mean for some of these guys can
mels/021551.pt|well all the time so now this has happened the rich guys are
mels/027679.pt|to figure out how to make this company somehow profitable and somehow get a return on this massive amount of
mels/026835.pt|just for the slot let alone what it
mels/022583.pt|in the gaming to a deeper level
mels/016985.pt|if you're interested at all and if not don't worry
mels/028929.pt|last thing i remember is i wake up i wake up
mels/017491.pt|to give you guys a win that's a big win for
mels/013838.pt|leave that they control spider-man outside of film rights do you think sony has this weird belief
mels/010754.pt|or something you're looking at my and you probably have your phone open
mels/013382.pt|i experience on every flight recently
mels/024223.pt|if the are they worth it was
mels/024097.pt|a bike lane and you're like what if i don't have a car though what am i
mels/002257.pt|it but didn't understand the jokes
mels/020254.pt|side of the emotional spectrum generally if a good holiday ad is going to take advantage of the fact that during the holidays we're all in our fields a little bit more
mels/006318.pt|guy and it feels kind of shitty i
mels/015436.pt|but this is i wanted to have him holding the
mels/028376.pt|it's themselves as a machine and they talk about how much bandwidth they have if i'm trying to say i'm busy
mels/008799.pt|is also pretty airtight like it's like
mels/030991.pt|at the triple and uh he was kind of intimidating
mels/031094.pt|if the hang out stans would
mels/012132.pt|one and like i can tell her what's going on and we're like it was
mels/008162.pt|lud stands and lyric and then i immediately have smite
mels/028792.pt|no seriously i mean i i just thought i'd rather just
mels/002052.pt|in dangling cross earring and lives
mels/027067.pt|people it just it felt like
mels/026928.pt|there's nothing no probably makes you
mels/020192.pt|silence brad and it became a long
mels/016386.pt|that everyone got is a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of
mels/030024.pt|came together and you know what
mels/020277.pt|it's been like okay we have boring weird ads and we're
mels/028007.pt|the future of the market so like i said way back in my first video on this console war as long as the competition remains fierce between
mels/022821.pt|and time warner should have been like
mels/010549.pt|i recognize the signs of depression okay when i saw this tweet where you said
mels/029343.pt|first things i ever do i got to see the set of law and order that was pretty cool it's like the city street they like film
mels/006321.pt|i dug up a bunch of private info on him
mels/032332.pt|and it is not a coincidence that he chose
mels/013890.pt|you idiots how do you understand the
mels/026663.pt|like a weasel or a rat
mels/003450.pt|the it makes apples chips it makes nvidia's
mels/010198.pt|go shower out or what yeah okay so the
mels/014685.pt|the discord ping didn't tell us anything
mels/024038.pt|i could get the deals and then kind of look the other way and not really enforce basically any
mels/025867.pt|but he talks about how blizzard tried to fly out scarra toast and a
mels/026999.pt|if they did it made it stand out it stood out it was one of the most talked about ads it was one of the highest rated ads coinbase installs jumped to number two on the app store the night of so it was it was demonstrably successful i think it's a very good ad i think they did not
mels/030416.pt|i had a photographer playing for td but i
mels/021429.pt|you make a bet on robinhood they sell the information about that to these major hedge funds is that legal it is legal but it's very unethical it's very shady and there they go to great lengths to not talk about it robin hood's largest client and largest customer is citadel capital okay citadel pays robin hood
mels/008401.pt|if he wasn't wearing his tuxedo
mels/024573.pt|where they tried here's why epics lost so you
mels/023037.pt|rulings and so i don't think that apple will lose now that being said
mels/011177.pt|i'm not a total loser anymore you know what i
mels/017761.pt|way more subs than me and in fact
mels/013893.pt|you didn't get dune i got dune there's
mels/025006.pt|to bring quote bring jobs to get the break the
mels/005412.pt|me i'm literally giving you money
mels/009950.pt|okay it's black or white yeah i get it no i understand i understand
mels/029783.pt|yeah i might see what my wife's
mels/016607.pt|we get around this alleviate this uh
mels/003335.pt|economy into a recession to prevent any sort of wage price spiral from happening which would mean rising wages
mels/006094.pt|you thought it was the whole debate over whether or not you were allowed to
mels/002743.pt|i need the money what does that mean what do you mean i you
mels/022242.pt|why did he have to sound so insanely sad and
mels/007179.pt|i heard that he has trouble getting out of state he has a hard time getting to tournaments he's like
mels/022275.pt|and that was pretty terrible honestly
mels/031121.pt|and easy to say after the fact but i i've i've always thought
mels/029087.pt|and i i i'm glad i did was lazy because my idea for my global emote was
mels/012632.pt|it was cool or like she floats up and
mels/009487.pt|at them so much goal that gets inflated and becomes worthless it's still going to genius if at them so much gold that gets inflated and becomes worthless
mels/026341.pt|yeah people just come in and open the package all day to test the experience and
mels/003248.pt|it would you couldn't buy three percent
mels/031275.pt|we're all they are so i try desperately to explain to him
mels/025030.pt|but it's dominoes dominoes in the united states orange julius in canada which
mels/013679.pt|in a marketing monday we have some wins and fails and then we need to get to talking about ludwig's move okay there's no getting around it
mels/009955.pt|will you pay somebody to object at your
mels/026172.pt|here because i was worried that they were going to be even in more trouble after a leak came out this week that they were shredding documents related to their abuse investigation yeah this came out but who cares about this bro overwatch mobile could be happening oh
mels/013028.pt|it's that you can like really go deep on that'd be hype but they can't really do that in a regular school
mels/017775.pt|does sound effect when a sub because i think
mels/002467.pt|and they they had no affinity
mels/002917.pt|it's gonna be interesting how that plays out especially in the light of let's just take a quick
mels/031522.pt|and flash the best terran of all time
mels/025456.pt|as of your help earlier with my thumbnail but the ones that actually are well guess what here's the fail everyone that's not doesn't have an opportunity to get involved in this sick internship i found to get this internship that my
mels/025142.pt|with the peanut banger hashtag that jiffing good
mels/014562.pt|i watched him every morning and the fact
mels/009234.pt|whipped around and smashed as hard as it could
mels/005477.pt|my my not even my aunt dude i think like my aunt's friend
mels/024277.pt|had to get laurence fishburne and the rights to his matrix character but let's go to number eight and see if it's any better this one is by jaguar we've actually watched this one if you're a die-hard
mels/001804.pt|your life but the vibe will not be live
mels/006069.pt|but turns out like i said the mobile rule applies mobas are always fun with friends when you're winning and we won twice and had a blast this was the best
mels/023875.pt|as graveyard of our best and brightest soldiers
mels/013461.pt|the times i've been humbled riding in my dorm elevator with a guy
mels/003327.pt|we're still not outpacing inflation which is a little bit higher than that but you are a closer to maintaining
mels/023958.pt|what cheaper but the problem is that selling it cheaper with no
mels/003287.pt|we've been seeing and he's got a good correlation here i'm
mels/004849.pt|i just started stealing content which he's done for a while but
mels/008266.pt|i'm talking about like the first wave of esports wave one people like fatality
mels/010973.pt|film would be more appropriate and that's true and that's wise and i'm sorry and you
mels/003965.pt|i we're going to do it and then tyler1 will
mels/020955.pt|if they do that it is the it is the
mels/024814.pt|get crazy that's where they are really taking advantage of the skinner box nature of our minds this is a video
mels/003715.pt|you'd think nothing can be done but in fact
mels/028234.pt|with the couch on twitch because he really
mels/019116.pt|basically now in some countries the
mels/023120.pt|because it's you don't know what the that
mels/013488.pt|definitely gotten better rack well actually i know definitely gotten better at well actually i know i've gotten better
mels/016498.pt|with any one person your personal performance only matters as part of the equation and a lot more of
mels/031723.pt|erie craft the ending you know what i mean can we find you know what i mean what if
mels/008869.pt|the shareholders of twitter will probably sue the board for not pushing
mels/030712.pt|it was ordered from china and delivered by
mels/027936.pt|you did want to consider getting involved in investing and perhaps more safer stocks or maybe you just want to test your brain and invest small fractional parts of money just to see how things would do perhaps
mels/022138.pt|and i was tired and i was putting this together and i remember you have to make the email subject header before you write it and it's like on a separate page
mels/003435.pt|once he secures it and he's locked in
mels/002010.pt|if the milk tea exactly that's exactly what i like i don't the little balls in there they're like
mels/021761.pt|there's a lot of things wrong with this whenever you put them in the exact same costumes and set as they were when they were like
mels/005902.pt|he literally said everyone needs to go on stream and say that i and say that i paid
mels/008921.pt|well as if i'm ever in south america and need a criminal offering i will hit you up
mels/027502.pt|financially towards this sale happening and that that gives me an interesting point of view because i want to talk to you about sort of what led to this moment you guys probably heard a lot of
mels/028872.pt|yeah okay so i did 21
mels/002702.pt|you don't really you got things to do spend your money now
mels/011941.pt|fucking little data pad starts getting messages from some of the actors that i've already met because they

mels/013342.pt|in bad and we had to throw them
mels/023631.pt|oh my god dude the ice government pride month post

mels/017426.pt|if the for people to not do drugs so it
mels/024568.pt|the judge like fully upheld apple's right to
mels/001666.pt|a single video is factor related what what are you talking about yeah the first video

mels/004724.pt|you are not the only person that likes listening
mels/012308.pt|with the table and so i did a lot of drinking and gambling at that table it was actually really fun it was actually really fun so i kind of
mels/023137.pt|would they were like well i don't want to be i don't want to kill a dolphin for this fish if you think about it for two seconds you realize you're not killing a dolphin but the fact that
mels/000065.pt|or celery that's the most fun

mels/017822.pt|whether or not they upgrade their their
mels/010806.pt|like even in film school they're like

mels/015614.pt|a terrible predator that stalks the
mels/019585.pt|actually catchy well i was shopping for a new car which
mels/007469.pt|it's just like one of the weirdest restaurants
mels/025005.pt|exact terms of the agreement so they could still fulfill the contract they made to
mels/002911.pt|really meets the road on netflix is big talk they have basically told
mels/023311.pt|it was forgotten about by the next day so that's a win for coke i was impressed
mels/026644.pt|in the competitive landscape okay because it
mels/026413.pt|or by your purchase after the fact um it's
mels/018214.pt|a three i think that's a little generous i would put this at a one or
mels/029178.pt|it was annoying watching them not get through it for so long but it would have been such a moment it
mels/024490.pt|kind of wanted both companies to lose and so
mels/012300.pt|in goofily she got her bb-8 droid her dad

mels/030536.pt|literally so obvious but i was
mels/030331.pt|it can i get some sevens for young
mels/019749.pt|is rhyme you know it it it's pretty impressive and this is again
mels/006055.pt|if you want to play offline smite
mels/004895.pt|yup shares of twitter because he's a very
mels/005693.pt|with the first came out and finding out they're
mels/023155.pt|looks like this into a burger that looks like this you know what i'm saying people want what they cracked up to be
mels/021946.pt|i was in a meeting at twitch and i was
mels/011993.pt|it's or whatever from kroy i show up and there's
mels/004582.pt|i was gonna say this tomorrow but the truth is
mels/028418.pt|just enlisted but by the time
mels/017139.pt|do you think there's a scenario where i could write off a twitch sub for my
mels/031288.pt|just go and i swear to god i got out i got out and i got away with it and so
mels/004479.pt|it's a problem and if i were to just cut back a little
mels/019421.pt|came back from the dead and is black is that what you think is and i got him for my show in the name of the company business i always talk about this this is not even a this is not even a jingle thing you need to have your name front and center people forget so much of what they see in a commercial
mels/028922.pt|this girl was like carrying me and i was like like it was
mels/030134.pt|two weeks until he gave up on it i had to play hey you pikachu against my will like
mels/013583.pt|i would never i would never
mels/025717.pt|when i think of scary brands there is none scarier than skittles so let's see what the masters of horror
mels/018968.pt|it's cannot handle that pressure so those two things are the fundamental problems they don't understand how attention span works they needed this they need
mels/017658.pt|it can create a story that is not a typical tech ceo outlook especially back in
mels/025534.pt|better online deals all that shit's
mels/006103.pt|i tournament and popped off sorority fan
mels/015119.pt|the actors but you might know who it is they launched house of cards and
mels/003848.pt|not saying i'm just saying that he has marketed himself well to
mels/029995.pt|it's such a weird because you grew in this niche of like
mels/029124.pt|at the twitch chat and announced that that had become an official
mels/019889.pt|it because it was a fun game in spite of peter molyneux promising and lying about it so hard
mels/023272.pt|but i got mad that she was getting
mels/028124.pt|what's called a spec a special purpose acquisition corporation which is where a company is already listed and they just merge with you and then you take the name so it would be a boring company
mels/004866.pt|count without calling it a layoff or a firing
mels/025984.pt|a company that hit the ground running in
mels/024398.pt|just spend dozens of millions of dollars maybe just rethink the concept and find a different a different concept that saves you money there's
mels/032039.pt|job is win dot dot dot and then i wrote
mels/016268.pt|when his research but i got no regrets
mels/027349.pt|called the brand identity model and
mels/013775.pt|california expanding their discrimination lawsuit because not only
mels/009614.pt|then as they try to escape
mels/031907.pt|but it's not i don't know how else to describe it if anything it was embarrassed you took
mels/017759.pt|we know and that's mango that's mango this is this is mango if
mels/015643.pt|and they have star trek nerds and that's basically all they've gotten
mels/026340.pt|beijing devoted just to packaging they have a
mels/023095.pt|the right one was rich full body a deep taste it was the same wine with food coloring and this study was repeated the real takeaway from this is that our brains are completely scrambled up with with the senses it all overlaps memory taste touch
mels/022310.pt|we're just said never speak to me
mels/009530.pt|what the problem with witchcraft is
mels/012606.pt|in five rex they got five rugs were me and they did not give me five rags back so they're making money they they got profit on in five racks they got five racks from me and they did
mels/021831.pt|it was convincing them to give him money basically for the business and i found that he's a pretty good writer and so i think that made me more likely to trust
mels/012907.pt|scar toef everyone was like blizzard
mels/022141.pt|this and we sent eight million people just
mels/022766.pt|was maybe a scammer but he did not think that radio on the internet was smart because the second he got his yahoo stock the second he sold all of it that he could and the stuff he couldn't sell he made a bet
mels/026095.pt|can take drugs and i sit at home drinking green smoothies and meditating i'll have
mels/020853.pt|i was like okay we don't need a stiff drink for your
mels/008728.pt|i can't just be there's a
mels/008659.pt|it would need to be like 80 it
mels/003623.pt|people that stigmatize living with your
mels/000603.pt|the whole thing ruled i'll be honest with every single one of us loved that
mels/024745.pt|but everything else combined today mobile is now bigger than pc and console and cloud and vr combined how did they do that how
mels/007126.pt|and if you're the person who has
mels/021335.pt|ideally as like a group of nations be aware that you are not alone if you feel this way you are you might feel alone you are actually among a very fast growing group okay it is not a rare feeling to feel a little more isolated a little more alone lately i thought i would make my final prediction and i think it's a powerful
mels/020909.pt|now does that mean you should pick a
mels/030224.pt|the story is from when he literally carried me up a rope and he
mels/031355.pt|wish me for having done any crime in anywhere
mels/002283.pt|as the stories would be crazy you get so
mels/016421.pt|if they get all that price appreciation and then
mels/004262.pt|it has been banned in china uh oh
mels/008821.pt|it gets out of this whole twitter thing
mels/000428.pt|and i'm doing this all night and

mels/025425.pt|but convenience store says and then they throw
mels/012047.pt|i don't have a video of it but like the wall instead of like the laser beam

mels/012166.pt|they have a they have like space poker okay they called it pizaak and it's
mels/015423.pt|the services as one bundle for the same price as netflix you can buy all three of them i
mels/000202.pt|this this kind of hat he used to wear this kind of hat to school this washing the big russian like winter hats to school in arizona he would wear this in arizona and not get bullied for some reason for some goddamn reason he this this kind of hat he used to wear this kind of hat to school this russian the big russian like winter hats to school in arizona he would wear this in arizona
mels/018635.pt|if the service they'll use that for the cloud microsoft wanted to own all three and they flopped on mixer
mels/028467.pt|it opens and i'm like behind the door and my dad's desk is on the right so if you come in the door you look to the right to see my dad at his desk and you'd look to left to see me this
mels/025378.pt|but you would have to purge
mels/027892.pt|in a mall for no rent at all and they just get a cut of your revenue like right now you can go to a popular mall and there's a decent chance you can get literal
mels/007431.pt|he doesn't need an enron hat
mels/010021.pt|there's literally an snl sketch that
mels/027702.pt|to see what I'm looking at you can
mels/018182.pt|but i'm opening the ad review okay it's the
mels/031826.pt|if these two didn't exist people wouldn't even have known there was a hot tub meta that's my honest opinion i
mels/011648.pt|what i'm thinking is this is
mels/016418.pt|a bunch of money is printed at
mels/032423.pt|we're using descending dark like me then you should avoid getting too close
mels/002870.pt|pretty big blow to his ability to really stretch it out even though he has a ton of money
mels/018090.pt|oh my god they included that they included that in their game
mels/018301.pt|you got here first yes but my dad he sent me this book
mels/007110.pt|i started watching a lot of youtube
mels/032250.pt|he has like an eight the point is whoever's
mels/001475.pt|mean this could be a good thing but i
mels/026305.pt|i of the things as well as everybody you can't put all your money in everything
mels/028541.pt|in the car ride a skateboard i didn't have a car so i had to skateboard i
mels/031654.pt|i've been sleeping on the floor eating cheetos finally someone
mels/003835.pt|it's all about picking teams yeah but you could i
mels/022993.pt|and so this is pretty compelling evidence they knew what was going on they didn't need this and they just wanted the cut they just wanted the fat stacks and despite the fact that yes steve jobs
mels/029423.pt|the reason i brought this up is
mels/026519.pt|that of the proponents of nfts like
mels/031502.pt|but outside of that i mean we don't even it's like it's like rank zero we don't
mels/026436.pt|was personally to have no sound effect when a sub because i think
mels/011950.pt|rate of him and i'm not i'm not gonna
mels/002458.pt|cause then you get too specific and you cut yourself out of a lot of other people who also like your product
mels/000614.pt|but then then we have to enact operation
mels/003037.pt|one just has that thought instantly
mels/013296.pt|your plus you're going to match
mels/004531.pt|people to be critical of crypto and nfds
mels/014501.pt|cameras weren't getting paid by anyone because twitch wasn't offering to pay
mels/003980.pt|keep your head bare not your treasury
mels/010347.pt|you're saying i should be both spots in
mels/012493.pt|around you your choice to experience
mels/026915.pt|if be the one one of
mels/028799.pt|a good day if you took what i made in one month and
mels/000498.pt|yeah here we go i forgot yeah i
mels/008060.pt|i'll do it myself the joke's on me
mels/031787.pt|so last time we talked about this the big invasion was the minecraft kids the minecraft creators had staked out a gigantic piece of twitch island but in fact if anything their influence has shrunk since last time
mels/014883.pt|or for themselves the developer and i thought it was a really smart speech he said that all the
mels/028191.pt|the last big tournament win if you've heard of him but most importantly it had a venue that had snow that collapsed the roof so everyone shows up in fucking new jersey in the middle of winter for apex when fifteen and it was that the fuckin i dunno the airport hilton if the last big tournament win if you've heard of him but most importantly it had a venue that had snow that collapsed the roof
mels/002314.pt|we're almost there it'll be a banger
mels/013967.pt|if the wrong let's say you spend
mels/008005.pt|one in seven billion yeah not
mels/008107.pt|yeah i should give subs to ee as
mels/026343.pt|and packaging when you open the iphone and open the ipad etc you are more likely to feel validated in your purchase
mels/004976.pt|he also keeps amidst all of this continually pumping
mels/000710.pt|anyway i've known him for a long time i
mels/030905.pt|hey that it's kind of uh
mels/011735.pt|that they will never ever break character and everything is designed to make you think
mels/018547.pt|and they have to get market share they have to they have to publish this game for
mels/028202.pt|for no other reason than like this will be good for the community
mels/026472.pt|about it whether or not they upgrade their their
mels/020190.pt|worldwide and it was a very powerful tool eminem's
mels/004362.pt|did you see the new space telescope image i thought
mels/027074.pt|instantly dies i'd be bold that'd be
mels/014194.pt|so total hours watched i think this number
mels/023942.pt|hate about you know he might go to jail look he's even saying like
mels/015876.pt|the ad hoc model where they just basically subscribe to one service their main service probably netflix and
mels/030452.pt|like all throughout the open air and like the waiter he drops the glass and then of course she says pogies yes
mels/013386.pt|fuel guzzling bird in the sky flying
mels/013432.pt|how do you want me to say it i'll
mels/026970.pt|it feels like it played right into every
mels/010409.pt|well obviously better than one even if there's two at least you get some kind
mels/018631.pt|i and play the game on xbox game pass you'd have the xbox machine in your living room it would be a whole ecosystem because that's how gamers that is the most important thing for
mels/029829.pt|if the first time i ever met oscar this was the first
mels/031429.pt|i dunno how they understood anything either way it got back to the neighbors who then called the owners and got mad at them who then called ludwig and got mad at him
mels/020681.pt|in the chat i'm seeing among us in the chat you're all close but this award goes to
mels/016569.pt|the system there's never been a better time
mels/007131.pt|i thought it was so weird
mels/017002.pt|you're in just a minute we're
mels/001266.pt|you think sonic you mean they have this one
mels/012072.pt|first order uh he was he was good i mean he
mels/008935.pt|get nothing and it's almost like at that point maybe just buy the company because if he buys
mels/029618.pt|one perspective and i feel like that's another one of those things with
mels/000419.pt|shut up whose name was kyle i remember this
mels/015040.pt|you're at home and it was successful this was their this was their big
mels/017906.pt|and there's like a lot of subtle and
mels/001537.pt|the golden simple questions and they can't
mels/011533.pt|it's cool yeah i did see there was a mr mrs
mels/000779.pt|big plan to make the money back from vegas so hopefully it goes well
mels/020362.pt|not only do the kisses not correspond to any given note the rhythm and the amount of
mels/002155.pt|that fortnite has never been hotter so it's like a perfect time for me to just get jump right in
mels/015430.pt|disney okay they have stars they have an absolute massive bench of beloved beloved ip right now the biggest franchise in the world is marvel okay like
mels/000021.pt|no thanks only pepsi what do you mean the trick the trick is to keep walking
mels/001940.pt|i could just get a little more free time a little bit
mels/006030.pt|it was it was wild that's why i thought he was
mels/017182.pt|and i was sitting up at night at
mels/027763.pt|the fans of his stock picking show his
mels/009207.pt|there is no shortcut it's very mechanics based i tried watching esports and i couldn't follow a single thing
mels/006304.pt|yeah yeah yeah yeah i'd like to time it so that wins it fails is done like early
mels/007428.pt|so i didn't stand up during the
mels/013587.pt|that i don't condone and don't support
mels/000722.pt|people around you and i'm so happy this is
mels/026423.pt|it goes sells more subs than anyone his size
mels/010803.pt|it's really good you have to go see it and you just have to tell me what yeah
mels/010077.pt|no have tried factored from this and they
mels/000385.pt|saturday night was the drunkest i've been in a long time i i i you know
mels/005634.pt|that is why it sounds like ms because every interaction
mels/029527.pt|okay you hate him he hates
mels/002962.pt|if for real every kid wants to grow up to be the gray man
mels/005270.pt|like i didn't know what he looked like i'm just a really good
mels/001398.pt|if i pull up random shatters okay that's what i'll do i'm
mels/001538.pt|it's like absurd it's like i'm asking you can you
mels/017383.pt|in january and the sequel by march and if we put enough money into this we can make it happen how much was disney total that's a great question it's probably as much as
mels/004824.pt|well babies left and right to try and uh turn
mels/017277.pt|i want to go into public domain at
mels/012117.pt|so he's like what's going on over here
mels/030184.pt|racing these we're racing through these
mels/028359.pt|where you work jobs some of
mels/018449.pt|if microsoft microsoft doesn't care about
mels/002267.pt|the cat walked across the pc and hit all their correct keys
mels/026255.pt|and oh yeah you still have like 60 billion
mels/016606.pt|but this is a serious problem and it is leading to a lot of negative societal outcomes and finding ways to
mels/028114.pt|i have anything to do with the real story here which is that face clan might actually be going bankrupt let's talk about it but first let me tell you the story so let's give a win in the past i
mels/008824.pt|can be real i was talking with a co-worker today
mels/020296.pt|if the parents should die oh he
mels/008106.pt|like i said i'm not i'm not the only one i'm not the only one you gotta we gotta spread it around a little bit
mels/007498.pt|and she's like oh i'm you got the original
mels/006481.pt|it means is we can stop a recession by all going to strip clubs non-stop as long as we keep the
mels/022360.pt|the talking points in our ad read
mels/011364.pt|because that has connotations that i think you know you can say let's go
mels/016218.pt|for my phone and then for these i
mels/024356.pt|and when you see it in higher quality it's even more
mels/023703.pt|around the world the united states navy has the ability to take you around the world allow you to play pokemon go help you achieve the goal of being a pokemon master come talk to your local navy recruiter
mels/018490.pt|why do i have one large
mels/011962.pt|when you start to get like jobs
mels/014641.pt|number two i'll be gone next
mels/023526.pt|ferrari on the other hand they raise their perceived value super high and then they raise their price right up on the
mels/023882.pt|a negative shot i'm not even worried about them
mels/021716.pt|now here's the hellman's magic creamy dreamy amy schumer is not i i have no particular
mels/013628.pt|i was gonna do marketing monday today on literal streaming wars between like netflix and disney plus and hulu and
mels/011424.pt|in and then even then it might be so like keep it up
mels/025102.pt|people a lot of trouble i guess if all people know about it is that
mels/011887.pt|at the time the whole trip that i got to be in a place like this by myself okay from from that moment on
mels/014225.pt|enjoy ludwig's content and you have a prime and it's sitting around and
mels/004024.pt|it'd be a little bit annoying you
mels/003904.pt|or candidate so if you want to be that
mels/016637.pt|way way cheaper and heading lower there is potential
mels/028152.pt|we're going to get access to when they when they acquired instead they're not
mels/022775.pt|too much king radio on the internet that is genius number two now i think you
mels/011448.pt|everything that i read that's of any
mels/022107.pt|what an example is that these are
mels/032228.pt|and i have to sit there and watch
mels/000931.pt|the deals done i'm making big deals today okay how else do i want to how
mels/019039.pt|and said don't ruin the immersion
mels/015719.pt|actually believe in so it's cool
mels/030681.pt|so i'm trying i'm like you know
mels/028322.pt|is in the break room when dj wheat strolls up with his young son mini wheat
mels/029449.pt|in the world quick outside this room and so
mels/027108.pt|long paused in a while i love
mels/019111.pt|the trends data I've been looking into
mels/005162.pt|let's see this is not a
mels/026476.pt|what about drivers for all companies but nvidia drivers are generally better generally easier to use
mels/001873.pt|but instead of seeing it i have a reese's
mels/020514.pt|only allowed to use trailer footage you couldn't record
mels/021040.pt|know that doritos is sort of a gamer
mels/025835.pt|the cinematics and that is an incredibly brave decision they didn't want to let somebody who had more movie experience but no
mels/030652.pt|it was like it was basically the whole thing for the school that day so like every one of my classmates is now sitting i'm the only person in the fourth grade
mels/024268.pt|morpheus never sang it wasn't like a character
mels/017697.pt|of service afterwards greatly increased their chances of
mels/008943.pt|i you know what the financing fell through i
mels/017920.pt|discussion there's an online they spend the money to be the top of twitter to
mels/002105.pt|mike is hanging on for dear life it is it is
mels/020900.pt|ten years away and like that usually ends up being longer okay real estate is not a good place to start this is based because boomers
mels/006471.pt|the answer is what i'm calling the make it clap index aka strippers by looking at the activity of strip clubs and guess what they're incredibly down this is the fail
mels/008645.pt|where it's pretty reliable and that's why businesses
mels/023251.pt|it's can be skewed anyway this is penn
mels/018217.pt|if only using the cheapest actor from it so they were able to get the dad in their budget obviously they could not get
mels/025146.pt|it's like i guess they paid for ludicrous as well and they're
mels/020739.pt|instead of saying anything real there was a lot of bad ads plus there's the entire nation of canada who churn out bad ads with
mels/016431.pt|in general it is majority wealthy
mels/006309.pt|i was like a fantastic video
mels/022349.pt|professional gamer and global brand ambassador for dr squash

mels/020968.pt|that i'm subscribed to most of the articles they put out
mels/017633.pt|touch points for the first time you get to interact and touch a new apple
mels/003484.pt|no i don't hey ping ping
mels/009236.pt|i think it's a pretty common razor scooter phenomenon but i just see i have a memory because i was in arizona
mels/010650.pt|i was talking about something but then i started the
mels/020492.pt|and i think that about covers everything they've made up to cyberpunk i don't know if you're seeing a pattern but this has become one of the most valuable game companies on planet earth one of the most respected game companies on planet earth all off of one
mels/028729.pt|of getting messaged whatever i i completely forgot about it
mels/031115.pt|where neither of us knew the stars and so it took all saturday but we tried to erase it but none of us
mels/018982.pt|so even if it was just
mels/014948.pt|like might even be a better app for you it
mels/005888.pt|michael jordan or lebron and he's like yeah i'm the i'm that guy i'm michael jordan of fall guys like he thought he invented the jordan
mels/032019.pt|in from being a podcast host to being a successful podcast
mels/002965.pt|i got their sierra 6 lunchbox
mels/029499.pt|the worst sandwich i've ever seen in my life was what they gave
mels/010910.pt|with to go see it we don't necessarily want to play the minions takeover over my face when i'm doing the content we don't want world we don't necessarily want that even because i already have the minions right here one and a minion baby by the way i purchased the with the go see it we don't necessarily want to play the minions takeover over my face when i'm doing the content we don't want
mels/005555.pt|let me tell you it was at the
mels/010076.pt|i have used it actually shake
mels/017472.pt|labour rights campaign which i found to be quite impressive and it led to
mels/002857.pt|so it seems very likely that uh there's
mels/005652.pt|that i'm sitting next to misskip
mels/017579.pt|wide around this they did not care about this or this it really relied on create a sticky compelling advertisement and then the rest
mels/014733.pt|it's like i'm watching six tick
mels/000544.pt|it was a really sweet moment and we all have these and we're
mels/029927.pt|when he was a host like you would
mels/017680.pt|being perceived as luxury and high end and
mels/021918.pt|then you can pay editors to turn those
mels/014976.pt|what has figured out how they're
mels/015237.pt|is the final piece of the netflix puzzle and i think it's one of the
mels/027377.pt|in the other way and don't understand and then steal everything they can you could post anything you could post any copyrighted music copyrighted
mels/028395.pt|and what that means in buzzword
mels/016770.pt|i was immigration ever and uh and we're having
mels/015591.pt|the cost but they did buy it and roku has been going around with a little bit
mels/017181.pt|there was one day um probably five or six days into having
mels/009800.pt|germany is importing more goods than
mels/010937.pt|think i have a video for you that can really show you the cheese blaster technology this is
mels/003420.pt|with other governments and nations uh
mels/004273.pt|the only downside of crypto is that you lose all your money because the number goes down it can't because you're not allowed to sell
mels/027197.pt|invest in stocks crypto anything anything
mels/007854.pt|we can all relate sometimes this gets busy
mels/013706.pt|i'm going to do a fail to um
mels/003588.pt|it's like the great reset in the ryan
mels/026225.pt|any of your payments if you are delayed
mels/001903.pt|and youtube makes more than my job youtube is
mels/019007.pt|very long at all and a lot of female

mels/009307.pt|it's so colorful good point you should be a
mels/014938.pt|keith are we ready for that first sponsor question
mels/021704.pt|of to help your parents keep you comfy so yeah
mels/024598.pt|with this past week it's this tomorrow war truck driving around japan to promote the movie you know it's definitely
mels/025744.pt|they get bored they don't care the second option they love it and don't remember your product
mels/003260.pt|with published which you can't do because it wouldn't be
mels/016311.pt|and like eight times more likely than average private business but four times
mels/028176.pt|pretty that is losing money hand over fist
mels/016891.pt|but it still massive it's just still
mels/003735.pt|i didn't though what was that thing
mels/010221.pt|it didn't tell my friends and one
mels/012886.pt|we don't do what i did because it
mels/024864.pt|word that we can't afford to actually add new levels new maps that's expensive that's work so how do we make that fat juicy juicy profit that my friend is the achievers and how do we make money off them convenience this is where the big
mels/019312.pt|they have to start a company where they compete against each other in a marketplace selling laptops it was like a complete marketing game designed from the ground up
mels/022361.pt|let me tell you it cleared up my back it smells good and
mels/015494.pt|war employees they have cruise ships they have theme parks they have merch they have better
mels/019432.pt|so really you're just trying to get these in order if your jingle isn't catchy the whole thing is moot it has to be catchy and then from there you try to fit in as much as you can
mels/028925.pt|well now she told the story laughing no not assault guys
mels/001019.pt|is that fair because you've talked about it
mels/019494.pt|the unavoidable you can start getting them almost entirely
mels/029624.pt|the focal point of these episodes and i
mels/023723.pt|it's somewhere that's my only note but
mels/026228.pt|and they don't want to say late fees they don't
mels/021232.pt|there's not that many brands on
mels/008780.pt|is that it's not all of his money so like
mels/000365.pt|whatever it is teams are not stacked
mels/013438.pt|yeah i mean this is funny
mels/010790.pt|you know it's like it's a dangerous new drug and you need to test it and the only person you can trust is yourself
mels/024279.pt|while british villains and this one also cost eight million dollars
mels/006307.pt|cringe reviewer quantum mass flagged act man for exposing quantum shitty behavior is quantum that guy from the elden ring bad takes video
mels/031118.pt|we'd run race on stream and still beat him by like
mels/020255.pt|we're all a little more likely to think
mels/016622.pt|but again there are opportunities and there are bad parts that is of course the rise in the global average surface temperature
mels/012893.pt|well as equipment and like set up my dorm but whatever he was
mels/019507.pt|if the throughout you know it's talking about
mels/014576.pt|that's a world where no one's getting paid as donald trump said competition breeds excellence yeah you definitely want competition bro
mels/027104.pt|to be worried about specifically when it comes to growth stocks right now
mels/009968.pt|in the video i'm not sure
mels/025361.pt|you said hell here or something like they were like pointing out anytime i had cursed like you said ass in
mels/015502.pt|why they're valued exactly the same and it'll be
mels/011139.pt|i would say nice things without saying nice things dude i was saying
mels/026070.pt|and took in more than i think like the next two combined at this pace can hopefully have a future where every single movie we watch all year is a marvel movie with your help we can make it happen i want to see a
mels/028610.pt|it turned out to be pretty smart thank god
mels/023496.pt|e limits their sales they try to keep a few amount of cars going out because if there's too many ferraris if their
mels/004109.pt|do you know aged rock h drug but you
mels/025027.pt|most accurate one because people talk about
mels/019500.pt|in your brain you gotta see it around seven times seven plus times really if
mels/006317.pt|long answer to me and like people could have easily been like yeah keep it up or something stupid so i got
mels/025396.pt|i got a tweet from slime what did
mels/030245.pt|eccentric character said hey you can stay with me my parents are also gone we'll just chill
mels/027269.pt|we don't do tv advertising there's no like
mels/023740.pt|we have qualities these are now my number one
mels/011150.pt|i made like a real physical copy
mels/014266.pt|i know this is not relevant anymore
mels/021953.pt|way too expensive and it really is
mels/004139.pt|like not just assistant but like like
mels/031252.pt|and i get there and of course it's closed of course it's
mels/027753.pt|version of the headset and then take all their market share anyway let me give you a fail this is going to be the
mels/017119.pt|congrats though critical fart juice critical fart juice is that like critical race theory what is that what is critical fart juice what makes it critical moist critical what what what what
mels/030204.pt|we clear no you didn't to be clear i have
mels/012828.pt|right before the tournament by the way it's crazy because nick allen a guy that i'm friends with that guy was
mels/022443.pt|the android because the color of your bubbles will change the simple fact that you get a blue
mels/031512.pt|is the last game of the last season
mels/016875.pt|the average adult or child in your case is watching extremely a lot more digital media
mels/012984.pt|i i think the whole concept of like splitting the day
mels/001296.pt|i'm sure they'd have a million views but they
mels/026553.pt|i'm stealing i don't give but yes this like
mels/032156.pt|give you a very very quick craps lesson
mels/015279.pt|anyway their current strategy is uh is
mels/007810.pt|wins and fails shark tank react or some kind of react and i do targeting tuesday tomorrow on the topic with a little bit more polish a little bit more
mels/002990.pt|some kind of yelling okay i can't we can't make it out but it's it's whatever okay i think and then rochelle who's a little closer says did he say show me your hands i
mels/032240.pt|when entire life i think aiden says
mels/015375.pt|the i understand how to make a good product they understand
mels/006800.pt|in the text to say you got this king ludwig shamed me in the night
mels/011959.pt|so that's how i figure i'm going
mels/030913.pt|ah that joke was not meant for
mels/012791.pt|but i did meet other grinders and
mels/028034.pt|actually an awesome thing and good for workers rights but
mels/019266.pt|at the launch to be as close
mels/029244.pt|seamlessly smoothly people in the crowd noticed
mels/024157.pt|i still didn't make a giant contract from mixer that only had to do half a year for ninja still remains undefeated as the ultimate bag in all of esports
mels/013964.pt|the disadvantage is that for that privilege of putting you on training wheels they
mels/024876.pt|if they didn't give it to him they all
mels/024370.pt|that is the budget of many small movies
mels/020307.pt|is for parents of kids this age it's it's clever it shows the
mels/018731.pt|usually gives you a prestige factor
mels/026528.pt|as you expect me to go yeah
mels/029627.pt|which kind of explains some of the
mels/021275.pt|three or four nuclear bombs i called of
mels/001607.pt|that's it thanks again for sponsoring my
mels/002997.pt|mass panic like that so quickly everyone is like bored in their seats and then
mels/004779.pt|we keep dropping even more so he uh
mels/000786.pt|some of the really fancy stuff
mels/031080.pt|we didn't i i knew from working there and so i knew that ludwig was going to
mels/008109.pt|okay last day of february and all
mels/017318.pt|if they're about to go to war there is nothing similar to what it is it's like a draft yeah
mels/012470.pt|bunch of food and dessert and
mels/007177.pt|is doing and as you get better it's going to be a problem for for established people and i said if
mels/000645.pt|they start beating us at blackjack they
mels/015986.pt|if the company in the world they can lose money on game pass to hopefully get a dominant
mels/018512.pt|it's clearly made it a strategic priority
mels/008768.pt|it doesn't seem to hold up and all the articles that i've read
mels/010615.pt|lyric that's right me and larry the
mels/025432.pt|this is not a powerful moment
mels/002157.pt|as there are cameras around squid game stages but in fall guys
mels/015160.pt|it was such a global phenomenon and importantly
mels/010920.pt|or like you know put it together it's a
mels/015978.pt|wharton than making money you just you take a bunch of debt on you lose money you lose
mels/019979.pt|you're smart of him to see that value but here's the deal here's the deal boys it wasn't his best acquisition because number eight here on my list is actually more valuable than pixar was if you can believe it a marvel movie may also makes as much as a pixar movie about a billion dollars per year but here's the thing about marvel the
mels/017489.pt|which is which is really nice
mels/030306.pt|was that the best man at standards wedding i was the best man there without a doubt i looked around all the other males at
mels/021200.pt|i am telling hollywood executives that a full batman beyond remake slash reboot
mels/017142.pt|point crow okay no i don't like point
mels/016176.pt|yeah you know what you actually save a lot of money on gas
mels/003163.pt|is kind of not happening as quick as we
mels/026701.pt|close to ready uh fans absolutely despise the massive
mels/011169.pt|yeah he's hard to find he's
mels/010191.pt|i just really bad i started
mels/030974.pt|sportswear industry people be like dreams merchant smiley faces boring
mels/014087.pt|facebook gaming with the worst logo in history
mels/004879.pt|at the companies like neurolink is
mels/012679.pt|try banning asman gold when the i feel
mels/010140.pt|in the cat it's not the nvidia geforce rt
mels/007746.pt|you just point to the tank top
mels/005943.pt|the dude actually does get salty
mels/012344.pt|oh yeah here it is here here's my
mels/012222.pt|i you're not gonna understand this but
mels/010814.pt|that's fine only family friendly night i
mels/022829.pt|which i i believe to be correct that going forward the time
mels/007204.pt|well if he's interested i'll sponsor
mels/012505.pt|i think it's slightly too expensive i think probably at half the cost it's pretty good
mels/031884.pt|what should i do bro you're
mels/026674.pt|like what they were what who had the power here the power was with twitch this guy had just promised all of these investors that the overwatch league was
mels/003738.pt|and that corporations could basically donate to politicians and it was legal and like they could make these
mels/017529.pt|we'll think of marketing a lot they only think of commercials what is marketing outside of commercials okay what is what are the other aspects of marketing that help build a company's brand other than just
mels/020004.pt|i to go to 30 billion would crash my
mels/018380.pt|in other words he had a monopoly monopoly
mels/001864.pt|oh he's busy that day that month so we'll see we'll get it we'll get
mels/026800.pt|make like 70 billion dollar buyouts
mels/019028.pt|last year and that's what's important to look at and i think what made it so interesting and uncomfortable to people is
mels/009793.pt|crane a sovereign nation but the problem is like the damage is is just as bad to europe as it is to russia really
mels/009830.pt|well as the first electric car
mels/025164.pt|oh about a year ago about a year ago today
mels/007519.pt|just joining there was a guy at the tournament who grabbed my arm and said yo coffee cow and gave me a
mels/005873.pt|he was trying to find some validation
mels/007113.pt|two options you can watch this game of thrones clip compilation or you
mels/017135.pt|the monday i think we might be able
mels/004180.pt|is he always wants to come on at like two o'clock on a wednesday and i'm like hey love that date i have mentioned a couple
mels/010205.pt|in front of me i didn't want it
mels/002529.pt|your favor mathematically but do you have what it takes to push it one more time
mels/029070.pt|and that's what i'm saying dude let me
mels/029754.pt|i don't trust the vimeo link you better be a monopoly for me to trust
mels/008718.pt|the damage so to speak and like try to rewind everything to before elon musk got involved which means him paying a lot of money to twitter and then him walking away
mels/010698.pt|you know some days in retail
mels/002925.pt|what am i watched it and it was
mels/031326.pt|they have some very strict laws around it so for one sip of water
mels/011089.pt|thanks dude i forgot his name now
mels/011680.pt|there is no worse more annoying nerd than the
mels/027211.pt|prior to the release of demon souls which barely edged it out from there they gained a cult following and when they released dark souls two years later it
mels/030605.pt|why just just don't be wait ethiopia
mels/001689.pt|wonder to get a free ticket he doesn't deserve he got out of bed and danced yeah after not doing any work around the house everyone needs him and he just sits in bed all day like he's bedridden but he's not he can dance
mels/027705.pt|we get a free slot for signing up so there's no real reason
mels/004231.pt|why not be but i got so many messages like that all throughout
mels/011906.pt|and some people were like we're like me
mels/020893.pt|when they're not perfectly flat on
mels/025901.pt|wait for a zero tolerance policy like that's
mels/008954.pt|i think he had a bigger plan with it i don't think he was besides the last time he needed an excuse to sell his shares he just made a
mels/014400.pt|if you're a creator in the new
mels/017969.pt|people i like and physical activity and you know i
mels/019648.pt|in the about the one and only sweet
mels/023415.pt|and i feel too good about it so if you
mels/013535.pt|were bonding gaming thing when it was just him
mels/004766.pt|a lot of things that he was doing before
mels/027070.pt|i thought the whole joke was that it would just be the sloth and then he would eat the chip and it would be like so spicy that like he would go from
mels/009333.pt|organic milk and organic vanilla powder i i've never read the word organic that many times
mels/010680.pt|through the boss and nobody wants to
mels/027721.pt|i think so Tommy in it maybe
mels/020587.pt|not be honest and say this was a good launch
mels/014243.pt|with better vods they can grow hours
mels/004735.pt|at them out at any cost
mels/029328.pt|i see what they're wearing i'm like a little
mels/014921.pt|top 500 and by the way
mels/002873.pt|from there will be to take
mels/005318.pt|she having a good time super funny guy uh
mels/026008.pt|will face jail time which is super unfortunate
mels/016323.pt|we're all the little boys and girls in
mels/001060.pt|blanks and it's a good one
mels/010129.pt|to have known you for just a brief moment in these ever branching paths called life
mels/023837.pt|he made me a marketing monday intro a fantastic one he also made me a song for my
mels/027678.pt|the thousand dollars a month for twitter that sounds good that sounds good but that is the type of groundbreaking thinking that
mels/023364.pt|to see if actually someone had mentioned
mels/020131.pt|it's been left it up but without committing fully
mels/019829.pt|watch today but you should watch it um
mels/031490.pt|if the game that hard there are people in korea who lived in team houses and played starcraft every day of their lives for their entire youth only to be called a b teamer and get cut
mels/020274.pt|it's a knock at coco's dominance of the
mels/022132.pt|after the explosion that they sent to every adidas person that went is insane i just
mels/003022.pt|this is the only thing we can find when
mels/019084.pt|well it's not human and you can
mels/022605.pt|oh yeah it's pretty good i think that's pretty good i think
mels/014623.pt|and then youtube didn't clear it for live
mels/015670.pt|the not going to a t v shows they can do what tv shows they can do
mels/005238.pt|so i brought him so i get to the back of
mels/022522.pt|the the mark of a good april
mels/016630.pt|in a city like new york it was
mels/025452.pt|let me give you a fail though
mels/002546.pt|asap rocky or we will move on to the next one he wants
mels/031583.pt|with the crowd the crops losing their
mels/016655.pt|in the history of companies it's bigger than stripe facebook
mels/005771.pt|i was talking about numbers this is a real story that happened and i
mels/004470.pt|if i feel like it and then
mels/006957.pt|call themselves crazy if you're a
mels/022034.pt|several tweet i obviously think the tweet is obviously
mels/008967.pt|there's no i mean the contract
mels/005553.pt|it was at for the shimmer awards doubled up
mels/021564.pt|the tomorrow but you could probably hold if you buy tomorrow and
mels/029923.pt|already sort of made it when he started beating the first ones but really we kept saying at the time that northern
mels/013460.pt|lot to learn from that and i think we should all take lessons
mels/021086.pt|we'll just pop this over here perfect let's see
mels/025707.pt|well lit and delicious and have good food inside and he
mels/006561.pt|speaking of huge companies that are no longer
mels/013390.pt|no chance to experience even though i've started to make more money in the past basically two years
mels/004755.pt|or payments and it was going to be about a 2 billion dollar
mels/023546.pt|and the plan is once you get everyone
mels/014068.pt|the platforms youtube twitch and mixer were on the scene okay
mels/029957.pt|i think you saw no he didn't raid i think
mels/024309.pt|we've actually seen before and it features one marshall mathers
mels/022524.pt|is that it it takes things that are your core brand values things you want people to know about you things that are are central to your brand and pushes them to extremes in a funny way you know so let me show you example of a really good april
mels/004839.pt|so he's got a lot happening and
mels/027357.pt|it is like the the bedrock of the brand then key things that
mels/032125.pt|scar if i wanted to hear
mels/016947.pt|so you don't feel like you have
mels/028383.pt|this one i could do it and that makes the work on their end so now they have to go to your boss and find a way to make you take off other projects let's circle back as it is classic let you could probably i think half of corporate america is two people
mels/013884.pt|weird ass death stranding style movie that's
mels/007982.pt|and so it's funny to see you guys question
mels/012189.pt|we can't have an odd number of people so if someone shows up we'll let you enter but they have to
mels/000381.pt|knights of gambling i've ever had in my entire life in my entire life on this earth i have never been so lucky it felt like i had bachelor party luck
mels/025924.pt|is riot but i wanted to do a quick jab here at valve because i found this tweet
mels/025298.pt|it just continue to grow people don't really churn out like you don't buy netflix watch queen's gambit and then say okay
mels/014338.pt|is the future and makes their own streaming services and they did and so very
mels/019256.pt|it's battles which took actually took place in ancient
mels/012202.pt|like there's bedding by round you can go all
mels/023921.pt|i have an l my l is for
mels/026829.pt|talking about ever that goes through uh
mels/018576.pt|whoever wins the generation where we go to the cloud is the permanent winner okay because
mels/014129.pt|mixer was still small it didn't change anything
mels/007461.pt|it's or whatever he's like ten percent if he's on a good day for him ten percent
mels/015689.pt|if the worse than hiring you guys they can't do worse
mels/006121.pt|with the context cody had already said on
mels/017937.pt|three players don't care spend no money on
mels/004395.pt|we're a letter first of all you don't need it in twitter is this
mels/002969.pt|this weekend and me ari stanz and rochelle went to a
mels/024748.pt|i would like to take the time today
mels/024893.pt|so you have to spend money next up we got a limited time offers now if you guys
mels/017962.pt|no that's not a good way to
mels/017353.pt|don't worry about that thanks lex
mels/022473.pt|actual problems that skaters faced what
mels/004098.pt|i don't think i was sick i think i was just really
mels/021641.pt|the casting choice of will ferrell is inspired just try to imagine anyone else but will ferrell and the
mels/015916.pt|the three lines marketing monday the ability to raise prices is a function of your perceived value netflix is considered very valuable to a
mels/016503.pt|well i'll give him credit for here if a trend is
mels/004303.pt|think with no problem the music might be a
mels/005434.pt|and i want to shout out my
mels/028337.pt|and the kid is right there also now more than
mels/009591.pt|and they get all the way to the base and they
mels/008985.pt|no no no no no they already they always
mels/018639.pt|so we'll see how that plays out but
mels/023807.pt|out there bro that's literally quack that's literally quack editing the video youtube commenters
mels/017709.pt|significantly higher for apple among their over over their tech competitors
mels/021691.pt|is more proof to me that i'm right
mels/003367.pt|and so if possible um do what you can
mels/000663.pt|and then we would see him jog back
mels/020447.pt|you know i want to dive into that because now they're offering refunds for the
mels/029121.pt|this was when they picked up an item called the helix
mels/029252.pt|it was like electricity double a j
mels/020707.pt|so edgy this is the most
mels/005179.pt|during daggers at me the point is you'll see in the video but
mels/001942.pt|bro are you beta spending time with your wife is
mels/031418.pt|well football you know just three guys like touch grass
mels/001757.pt|the moral of the one where the guy seals the

mels/015186.pt|this is how much they're spending next year okay nobody
mels/016250.pt|it's not put putting lebron's picture in an l final

mels/001910.pt|i have legitimately never thought about that is that including the one dollar quack takes oh i forgot that i have to pay my
mels/018485.pt|well that was a good intro

mels/030084.pt|it's like me and ash okay and the months go by we go through all of summer i'm getting closer and closer and closer i'm talking about it
mels/027114.pt|talking about what he said here real quick which
mels/021888.pt|looks pretty good tall starts a talent agency makes it one of the biggest in hollywood gets he's worth hundreds of millions of dollars and then jeff bezos comes along and
mels/002154.pt|i want to make a big splash

mels/025204.pt|in this past week oh so this is sort of relevant to
mels/027953.pt|is directing job of fast tin because of a
mels/008354.pt|but the problem is biden was going to go

mels/027815.pt|with the question you guys are asking a lot of people are asking this and in fact i
mels/027176.pt|in kick the can the clock

mels/019023.pt|cookies and things that make them relatable things that are brand cookies and things that make them relatable things that are brand safe let's say you want the massive brand reach of a logan paul and you spend a lot of money

mels/008155.pt|think i will no it's not dj wheat although you know
mels/020804.pt|he was provided not with a script but with certain talking points sure why wouldn't you give someone some talking points he told me he would read the talking points on one condition that i didn't watch his video beforehand so i haven't seen what we're about to watch now he knows who the winner is so hopefully he delivers it correctly hopefully he doesn't say

mels/002809.pt|it's who had that happen too
mels/001721.pt|worship have i told the story there is a cruise ship here have i told this story
mels/023538.pt|it underneath what it costs to make
mels/009350.pt|do you ever still think about
mels/026119.pt|there i think they're raising a strike fund a couple
mels/019919.pt|absolutely crazy i i cannot overstate to you how big of a drama and a hype this
mels/032389.pt|i could do it consistently but i'm saying the the grind mode of
mels/000563.pt|your friends aren't gambling what i thought they were they were crazy youtubers by the way we have been gambling but we haven't been we didn't get player cards or they can't track us
mels/012704.pt|i think mmos are built to suck up like
mels/026132.pt|and so it went back down again so i don't know i thought
mels/004129.pt|big a how's that chip bill
mels/028505.pt|it's where i tried to kill myself and faked it
mels/017115.pt|i think some new subs welcome to the uh truck
mels/025749.pt|i didn't watch that i didn't watch it ahead of time i was wondering what could it possibly be to have this
mels/019539.pt|they defeat all of canada's marketing with one song but that that i mean a
mels/000161.pt|on a roof and we just look at the city and we're like we
mels/007851.pt|we're presentation on the life and times of
mels/024887.pt|oops the balloon got through and ran
mels/015950.pt|watch netflix then you'll unsubscribe but if
mels/011890.pt|if there wasn't as many kids you'd think
mels/012139.pt|and i was the one doing this like i would get back to the
mels/010588.pt|asked the question everyone in chat said yep like they all do it like it's very common and it seems to me and this is just a theory but that one person something weird and then i made fun of
mels/008772.pt|what i'm saying is if they talk to an actual
mels/032272.pt|he is so degenerate to gamble he won't
mels/025881.pt|pick with blizzard watch this clip a hundred
mels/001443.pt|active for supporting the stream and the
mels/023126.pt|i thought was funny of what marketers have done so in australia in
mels/012433.pt|it's kind of cool this is where the
mels/019310.pt|is a competition there's only like 20 students in the class they are broken
mels/029776.pt|what am i doing over here i'm just
mels/021395.pt|essentially it's called a naked short when you sell it before you've even borrowed it you're making a promise to sell it and that only works if it guarantees goes down it's called a naked short so
mels/027680.pt|can you afford it yes we'll see how the debt holds up what will happen it can't get much worse i think that remains to be seen but as a company it's been holding
mels/013496.pt|you know i like the one i think we did it last time but it was like me after eight minutes of work i think i deserve a little treat
mels/001226.pt|as as someone who's in the marketing
mels/006418.pt|imagination of the future on linkedin let me read it for you okay
mels/005223.pt|it because there's probably a lot of other
mels/025481.pt|main goal is not winning esports tournaments acquiring them
mels/031717.pt|name the characters after the ducks from
mels/030021.pt|on the first thing i hear is
mels/027131.pt|you hear interest rates like the government
mels/013333.pt|although i'd love to hear your
mels/024212.pt|the getting those groups are pretty interesting because those groups are
mels/004523.pt|if you love that that's actually really smart a little knowledge with the relationship always
mels/007154.pt|when it comes to social issues my
mels/023408.pt|great value so it gets you in the door and then
mels/005615.pt|and it caused a big blow up i
mels/000188.pt|you thought you thought i met mike tyson
mels/029512.pt|when i come back to america i'm gonna
mels/023181.pt|boxes literally it's filled with glue and it helps the food stick in the right spot for photography and it looks like it has more of a shine
mels/000593.pt|the first five minutes i fall asleep now thank god
mels/031847.pt|im ninja everyone in this category wanted to be ninja and then just like
mels/015553.pt|and so that's exactly what apple tv
mels/007388.pt|that's my that's my experience he really he's a he's a character but
mels/016593.pt|so that employees are less likely to get hacked on the job and they raised
mels/030548.pt|it's in there and he's all alone and
mels/000899.pt|it's be robert the with this your one anti war warhol but smell like a war that's
mels/010642.pt|in a minute you all will be explained okay
mels/031173.pt|that's going to be a hard ass record to beat what's crazier about
mels/010093.pt|i mean like eight and i chugged seven of them
mels/015549.pt|that's it when you're a super rich mega
mels/022437.pt|of course but has built one of the strongest brands in global history and they i mean literally there's
mels/025490.pt|i those four all of which you've
mels/027060.pt|i just feels odd oh yeah yeah yeah okay
mels/022161.pt|that ad tested off the charts i mean
mels/021565.pt|what do you think will happen to canadian brokers
mels/026286.pt|it'd be anything from a service or a product or
mels/010417.pt|in cities so rural areas probably are getting
mels/004259.pt|okay how about step one all chinese computers fortnite pre-installed free v
mels/008749.pt|in the board doesn't want to sell it to you the only way it works is if you offer a number so big they kind of have to take it or
mels/019953.pt|it's my number ten i think
mels/003424.pt|basing on the things that is being read but it's um this is the clearest
mels/008140.pt|which is a supreme court some sort of
mels/013945.pt|are becoming very very successful and it's starting to have problems because people that are attracted
mels/002952.pt|never spent this much on a movie and it's it i
mels/021911.pt|manually push it basically he talks about you're grinding the flywheel to
mels/000373.pt|when they when they're like yeah high fiving
mels/003577.pt|let me understand what's going on so i can make a decision that is informed
mels/005903.pt|the exact cost plus an extra for the interest since
mels/023017.pt|apple and google both removed fortnite from their stores because they wanted
mels/008259.pt|in there and you can join find
mels/016793.pt|one for a long time the
mels/011492.pt|it's sad by the way i i am one of
mels/025533.pt|get expensive we'll get more uh
mels/025318.pt|you when you've flipped your jpeg
mels/022196.pt|they saved it they brought it home
mels/031965.pt|while the ultimate kids were the ultimate kids were not laughing let me start by introducing our all-star lineup years of research starting with
mels/004130.pt|i looked into it myself it's like it's it's like the biggest subsidy to intel
mels/014997.pt|in the kept cable alive but now as people begin to shift
mels/026308.pt|unveiled their very first apple store and they did it completely differently from established schools of thought they created an extremely expensive luxury temple to the brand if you
mels/000984.pt|five months kitten warlock think of
mels/028458.pt|i'm really just tuned out and then this young airman like a
mels/004269.pt|they go up but not down
mels/025840.pt|well that made the movie people made
mels/006223.pt|especially because i can't read them
mels/009930.pt|about the wedding and the answer is yes he's
mels/015052.pt|what it took off it was it was pretty successful
mels/003212.pt|is that wealthy investors from other countries would act as they called them hosts or
mels/030098.pt|two straight up it's there and if you guys don't know the the
mels/010254.pt|which when i say it like that sounds like a bad
mels/020515.pt|which means of course there was no footage of the massive amount of bugs let me say one more thing not to put too much of my own self into this but i have worked on a project marketing related with
mels/014334.pt|the greatest business quotes ever in
mels/003694.pt|the wealth gap in the 20s was equally as bad
mels/032337.pt|one who knows the hustle knows that i have never used spells ever
mels/024265.pt|the matrix and have all these made i
mels/020104.pt|steve jobs is going to be the interim ceo but we're definitely getting a different ceo so don't worry he's just
mels/019723.pt|it's the colleges are offering is exactly the
mels/015201.pt|possible to get american audiences to watch a korean subtitled show and they did
mels/021420.pt|we got what happened today which i think is one of the craziest public scams in recent memory
mels/019788.pt|it really good they don't look like this so okay we're adding this to the list
mels/015488.pt|very slow and it's what's keeping them from being as strong as they could be
mels/024811.pt|impact there is so much more than that
mels/031727.pt|we hunt down the writer or the producer
mels/019427.pt|it's powerful jingle so to be clear though i mean he's right
mels/027369.pt|well i think they understand what's most important in the world of branding
mels/026145.pt|sue me he called a bomb threat to the conference
mels/031860.pt|let's go bro look around cs goes in trouble bro not in trouble trouble it's still doing
mels/021011.pt|i see some zoomers asking is that real
mels/018852.pt|if this guy doesn't get cut to
mels/019897.pt|it's a decent game if it was like a tech demo it's fun i played
mels/026279.pt|if they spend on commercials advertising digital
mels/008578.pt|grandpa jack dude grandpa jack leaves
mels/011422.pt|do owe me quite a bit more than 25
mels/009839.pt|well you and my dad would get along my dad loves
mels/029043.pt|i i see everything in slow-mo dude the
mels/021336.pt|i for one one prediction that i think maybe can
mels/018798.pt|the actually be honest with you but at the time the concept of people putting aside
mels/024481.pt|the the whole concept is terrible and i swear to god for for food companies especially fast food companies it's not
mels/010319.pt|the one game of fall guys
mels/028884.pt|so i want to impress her so i do all of the drinking and the second and again i remember nothing from the night since i i put that cup to my lips
mels/022862.pt|what the career of pumping shitty internet
mels/005504.pt|the best i can say so you know it's the whole thing the whole thing is is it's hard to
mels/015387.pt|this was the big innovation this is what this is what made
mels/010072.pt|six seven months now um and when
mels/023947.pt|the award of the week oh i have one more
mels/024770.pt|we reduced let's say you're like oh i
mels/011610.pt|thank you very much uh so if
mels/029881.pt|i i'm going to all these tournaments
mels/017311.pt|is over half of those employees were added
mels/031872.pt|i don't feel good about it anyway it's cool the the main
mels/005061.pt|in a bit of a clown and at the
mels/024828.pt|according to the game players of the
mels/015099.pt|today's they have another crisis where it's like okay this could be the end of the
mels/025060.pt|and water access they bribe or otherwise coerced local governments into giving them access to water rights and then resell that same water back to the country at large markups they also do extremely degenerate things like
mels/001470.pt|angela merkel yeah merkel's gone now
mels/010065.pt|the rules are simple and they are threefold number one the video cannot be too long number two the video cannot be
mels/023569.pt|this applies to every company if you think about every company you can figure out
mels/026849.pt|and so we'll start with the squarespace
mels/002682.pt|i should have had him walk away
mels/020162.pt|god damn based it actually is
mels/005286.pt|right now i am trying to build wealth so that i can eventually buy a nice house
mels/013314.pt|that's my theory it's crazy call me crazy call me crazy i think that's what you do i think sometimes when i ask
mels/020709.pt|in the food i am disgusted so i mean
mels/015389.pt|it was in the early days of the pandemic okay the
mels/004778.pt|indeed a guarantee them with cash which would mean
mels/028791.pt|so it was like and i was like what what do i say to that so i say it again
mels/015724.pt|but i think i got over the
mels/025248.pt|figure out something new to do i don't
mels/007568.pt|it was like it was like normal normal normal and then the forth from the top was like i googled called like best scooby doo movie or something like it was like it was like normal normal normal and then the fourth from the top was like i googled googled like
mels/029728.pt|and i feel like within game one he was saying like
mels/014786.pt|i was signed up for that but
mels/010794.pt|ironic i think i think they could get
mels/029811.pt|full of play of everyone else is so good yeah i just bobby i i just want you to know like because i
mels/015880.pt|i think disney plus netflix bundle would crush actually of course it would but they well they don't want to do it
mels/022386.pt|this whole fake set just to lie about the
mels/025105.pt|my number one based on things that i've seen is comcast comcast and generally
mels/028985.pt|i've never gone more than a day without eating right pretty much ever i don't
mels/006881.pt|the the throwing around 10 000
mels/013527.pt|match with him didn't teach me the controls
mels/006293.pt|it's like that wait let me update my
mels/003274.pt|this one for example is a win on the concept of third chances because
mels/026756.pt|if you're right now it's very likely that multiple of these names but at least one
mels/008550.pt|is three-fold he's got three different
mels/023810.pt|a russian spy or something yeah
mels/005704.pt|with second in command mad or so and so we we we want that anyway but we actually got to with second in command man and so
mels/009587.pt|and there is no doubt in my mind
mels/024394.pt|one takeaway today it's that most of these
mels/029567.pt|if there was um it's funny because
mels/028268.pt|it was like please hire so
mels/007917.pt|or boomer if i do something you like you say poggies if i do something you don't like
mels/029726.pt|ain't like dude this is going to be hard for
mels/023689.pt|they gave the people four options the
mels/007292.pt|you get it though it's fine it's fine it's okay
mels/006681.pt|be interesting to some of you
mels/009726.pt|get their nails ripped off with pliers you wouldn't be like whoa yakuza vibes it
mels/000212.pt|i'm drinking so i'm not i don't remember everything but the only
mels/014516.pt|i'm proud of him it blows my mind would i ever leave
mels/016069.pt|and and other cutting edge fields for marketing he taught me to have analytical mindset driven goals and to
mels/002268.pt|we can sneak in a little cat for the
mels/031254.pt|but i really i really want to watch this game there was uh there was two parts of the mall
mels/005485.pt|i find out later my father put her up to it i'm getting
mels/018188.pt|way everyone gets your name right it's hyundai like sunday okay
mels/014532.pt|it's deep knowledge of streaming on twitch he said leagues viewers

mels/026738.pt|was different subjects metaverse has essentially become
mels/016435.pt|i just want that to be something that i stand for
mels/019631.pt|and so i reached out to him i got a hold of
mels/025696.pt|debt that you were making the ps3
mels/032378.pt|what radiance and i clicked radiance this is why
mels/020102.pt|they got steve jobs back in the company he
mels/027169.pt|this whole discussion all goes back to sheba coin which is what i was trying to say can we print more money so we already are
mels/029117.pt|i got this like trial by fire start out and then on my day one of the job the biggest thing like every monitor at
mels/005247.pt|well in front of me and he looks at me and he goes
mels/011358.pt|looking for one second he did do a good video
mels/008334.pt|at the protests i'm seeing i mean not
mels/025173.pt|i've had some companies like mcdonald's reach out to me and ask for a new logo
mels/014731.pt|hassan you need you need to do more
mels/011273.pt|man i miss the ghost look at

mels/028057.pt|i'm not an apple show i don't even have an
mels/026486.pt|already learned this lesson so they wasted a absolutely absurd amount of money
mels/009187.pt|cause i upload almost every day so it's pretty
mels/027607.pt|big crypto side then there's the employees that are threatening to quit and
mels/031935.pt|is this the same block like the limo drivers just is literally just taking
mels/008611.pt|and you've agreed and you've signed the deal and then later he comes back and says i don't want the car and it's like you've already you've already made moves as if
mels/010462.pt|is probably five separate streams across you know a little bit of time
mels/023321.pt|and that's that's all i can tell you
mels/022998.pt|if the clans money they get a cut off spotify money they get to cut off
mels/029665.pt|one of the greatest streams i've ever seen

mels/027375.pt|at the stage now you guys know internet businesses especially platforms like like platform businesses like youtube twitch facebook they've all used a
mels/022058.pt|i think the arab spring riots rumor is they heard our new spring collection is now available online
mels/020476.pt|the years and you buy a game that is
mels/013690.pt|the and engineers in a giant office expensive in san francisco and adds no features the biggest thing they've added is like a
mels/003791.pt|it's getting too late i can't
mels/005587.pt|so you can imagine with this
mels/021780.pt|what the category this was the ad for it i
mels/030058.pt|the most knowledgeable and he does probably have what was your
mels/003581.pt|like housing and and everything was getting out of control for people
mels/019481.pt|you think that'll chart chills bro
mels/028140.pt|which was awesome but unfortunately they actually
mels/030316.pt|as the pastor was asking he was like you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded what like
mels/019514.pt|the subway because they couldn't raise their prices with inflation so what they did
mels/022607.pt|what kind of thing if you're doing like new
mels/029351.pt|weekly i was making i was doing work for machinima
mels/006787.pt|as you saw in that clip at the beginning
mels/002427.pt|i charged so maybe they just didn't didn't work
mels/018560.pt|because to make up the cost of getting everything exclusive
mels/007000.pt|which is really cool i've never had that happen before
mels/024292.pt|is to associate itself with that element of sophistication of class of worldliness i think they picked the right actors for it i think
mels/020864.pt|probably doesn't even bother you at all but if you've been on tech twitter there
mels/032002.pt|went to have dinner with scar and his
mels/011744.pt|you know i bet if i were to drop
mels/016128.pt|thank you for supporting and uh and i'm
mels/015518.pt|there's not like a ton of movies and shows on there it's only originals that they've made in the last two years it's all brand new content
mels/019363.pt|i am going to do this
mels/013676.pt|you would do a different name sounds weird
mels/011285.pt|i interesting theory but is wrong but as fun sent me an invite yeah i interesting theory but it's wrong but that's fun
mels/027621.pt|the narrative in many non-chinese countries now jeff bezos is probably not the right
mels/019581.pt|the the greatest jingles because not only is it memorable not only
mels/017099.pt|you know what i'm saying it's like a bad youtube
mels/019873.pt|so whenever you launch a new
mels/019898.pt|this game is nowhere near what they promised they promised much like no man's sky a life simulator
mels/009872.pt|it wasn't tough but like getting to
mels/026399.pt|that people don't think of as much but they have a much bigger impact than spending extra money on tv advertisements these things have done more to market the
mels/012279.pt|this guy is definitely a lud bud
mels/016145.pt|don't make your life decisions based off of i'm
mels/026937.pt|it's a real problem right now and it's hitting the exact like literally perfect on the demo of who
mels/029645.pt|india with smoke coming up from his
mels/009357.pt|did better than the video of me actually doing it the first time so it's like in a way he gave me a lot of free content
mels/029148.pt|four and a half hours till the end of the night i got to
mels/012881.pt|it is expensive you know what i'm saying
mels/025442.pt|well violence in video games and for that in my mind they win
mels/019674.pt|the first one did well and you
mels/026101.pt|all of the men and women who have been striking against corporate america and otherwise over the past few weeks specifically i want to call out this person this is a lone striker holding down the picket line for the kellogg's strike in the rain with the hibachi sitting there this
mels/026120.pt|there's a rise in general labor movements and they're having success and i just want to say personally that i deeply support these and if you in your own life have a
mels/014436.pt|so that's that's where we're going with this and so they really want to win this and whoever takes the lead
mels/016388.pt|of it from the ppp loans um
mels/020143.pt|i have a bookmark try using oreo
mels/012680.pt|i feel like azmin gold could literally shoot a
mels/031476.pt|he can't he still can't do that
mels/020549.pt|would be the toughest time in the company's
mels/030631.pt|i dunno if i want to enter it kind
mels/010701.pt|i didn't say that or when mr beast shows up doesn't every retail worker get one day
mels/028155.pt|we are able to cut costs they could survive but if they don't cut costs and they don't find new funding faze clan will actually go bankrupt
mels/007172.pt|and j mook out of nowhere again i've
mels/024126.pt|it was a video on his leave to youtube hello
mels/027789.pt|it's called raising interest rates and when that happens it is
mels/019827.pt|it's a great video called the in goodening of
mels/026599.pt|am i won't even commentate dwarp
mels/030745.pt|what do you guys think what do you guys think trump the answer was true
mels/010308.pt|at the point is that they're splitting it up
mels/002149.pt|things will happen on that day that are not related
mels/008193.pt|indians rise of groove for free i just did
mels/013233.pt|randomly on a saturday they just go hey silk songs here boom it would break the
mels/021191.pt|his cohort of the population which means that in
mels/031645.pt|are very good translator and so nobody from all the bigger press outlets like all the people that were much bigger than than than team liquid at the time
mels/009371.pt|to have a good time and actually there we go the
mels/022704.pt|the rise of snapchat and other companies at this time was now eating heavily in
mels/004910.pt|by their own shareholders myself included because we were all standing to get a
mels/007415.pt|i would go with someone else if you have one friend or more that you can go with
mels/005040.pt|so it'll be like a top reply from like
mels/021102.pt|in the pizza for five dollars only at
mels/003899.pt|with an aggressive yeah i mean the santa's
mels/030302.pt|it'd be my best man because he's sort of everybody's best he's the best
mels/019038.pt|an appropriate mental health to sell skins and there was other people a large number of people in the comments who said who responded
mels/024677.pt|newspaper released a statement on friday saying that evergrande is not too big to fail implying they will let it fail implying that we may be due
mels/005194.pt|but i happen to have this shirt in my
mels/000480.pt|i sit in bed and i'm just dizzy and i'm waiting and i'm so tired
mels/011508.pt|with ride or die with their beliefs
mels/022770.pt|were been out of our cultural consciousness ever since yeah it was
mels/009140.pt|the video and then i released this one after
mels/022172.pt|why guarantee it's a sad one brace yourself
mels/030633.pt|i'm going to do it and i tell my mom my mom's like
mels/013353.pt|dude seriously i'm trying to help you
mels/006144.pt|team that i made in the last second and

mels/022054.pt|who's not guilty about eating all the tasty treats they want
mels/016349.pt|you're not give him the credit let's do

mels/000522.pt|and uh i with the piano
mels/008707.pt|at the day i think the number that i see like is one
mels/011778.pt|with the dangerous combination it's dangerous
mels/008715.pt|cause i think like i said the money amount is so high i really don't think a
mels/022164.pt|way of using emotion and tying your products uses
mels/005377.pt|it's not my fault it's not my fault i
mels/015059.pt|and you're ahead of the competition so you get certain key advantages in this case it was that hollywood had no
mels/016471.pt|as negative but some of it's actually really interesting positive and so i'm gonna talk to you mostly about where i think some things in the world are heading and i'll explain it right after this but you're gonna have to do me a solid you're gonna have to do me a favor
mels/008226.pt|that he literally raises interest rates stops inflation by
mels/025433.pt|in the world is all watching the rage
mels/004057.pt|okay that's your money that's harder
mels/013897.pt|i'm even more mad at the movie there's
mels/018017.pt|the first thing i flip open
mels/022093.pt|it's super simple this one i i need a i need a better it's a tough one to
mels/020923.pt|what the my passions league i need to be a pro player then the best i could have done probably
mels/014439.pt|we just won completely and twitch thinks
mels/020584.pt|is about like what this means for the brand
mels/022650.pt|the internet and is now laying on
mels/025579.pt|these people have the least human conversation i have ever seen this is what we get incredible developers like vertigo games the studio behind fan
mels/032336.pt|it was descending dark the ability that grants
mels/019459.pt|tell me the lyrics right now something about a nickel
mels/030104.pt|if the kid right you know

mels/021026.pt|i mean i think that's got broad appeal the highest honor it's
mels/015018.pt|but netflix but i don't want
mels/002744.pt|well i win by giving away 150
mels/003624.pt|if the your parents after high school is incredibly dated for a time like the
mels/000057.pt|i have like three fourths of a
mels/031024.pt|no i haven't heard of that
mels/016905.pt|as digital creating using on using uh
mels/023800.pt|i like they're they're so authentic to
mels/006997.pt|i think the first like gaming
mels/012082.pt|out of a crew of like
mels/000137.pt|that was your big joke if i can find
mels/010551.pt|me to feel anything listen i've been there i've been there i understand and it's it's it's a struggle that no one else can understand unless they've been through
mels/019762.pt|it'll be unique for each game but uh
mels/027391.pt|at the game oh well then we're suing them if it's a
mels/022880.pt|in fortnite back on mobile judge
mels/005437.pt|so here's the only thing is i took a photo again this is not i don't foresee this being a common thing for me in the grand scheme of my life so far be it for me if
mels/024159.pt|if the stream for half a year and then come back and then and then even though he didn't tell them
mels/022040.pt|the bk guys doubled down thought they
mels/011483.pt|the fact that that's a very unique situation you got a crazy story out of that most
mels/030239.pt|i got shampoo as a gift and that's all
mels/021093.pt|was actually considered unsolvable by the
mels/015889.pt|with marketing from the harvard of the southwest arizona state
mels/006820.pt|but i'll probably do an episode of night
mels/032190.pt|if the the phoenix suns because my
mels/004964.pt|a twitter employee um for example
mels/007830.pt|the videos for like 12 bucks a pop
mels/017678.pt|hi this is very common and it
mels/018197.pt|our dealership and you don't know how to say hyundai you won't even you won't
mels/025388.pt|are you talking about that's not
mels/028456.pt|just reading my book macking on my subway sandwich
mels/001713.pt|why this totally unrelated but if you guys
mels/024298.pt|i had a lot of viewers today
mels/024835.pt|the meta in some way so that different characters are more valuable so that somebody that says has a perfect
mels/001952.pt|i really good video and i never really have time to put in the full amount of time that i want to like sometimes i think of like oh that
mels/007655.pt|and then i'll finally reveal that video we just
mels/011683.pt|of expertise and ari does cosplay
mels/000531.pt|the ever afford one and it was due to stan's
mels/009281.pt|there's no way they sell individual ad spots it's probably a much larger package deal
mels/002675.pt|this is the default you have currently zero dollars first roll a two you have ten dollars to your name
mels/032206.pt|in around and we see some nice watches and we were just walking around this watch store being

mels/032051.pt|in the bobby's commentary that's my favorite of my jokes his products make twitch so much money every month they almost
mels/012723.pt|and it could have taken years for my
mels/020535.pt|season three okay because in today's modern games climate unless your game is a infinitely generating
mels/010843.pt|assassin who jumps around and sneaks around and does stuff doesn't exist so i'm
mels/023868.pt|it's hard to make a lighter ad even remotely
mels/029649.pt|in the line cause i'm making some
mels/016866.pt|yup even more and as ai continues to evolve

mels/024580.pt|well drawn out agreement is continuing to keep epic games and fortnite off the app store forever and so fortnite mobile remains a
mels/002102.pt|i just hate lands in mtg well
mels/030100.pt|and you could talk to your pikachu and control it you could say hey you pikachu um use

mels/022286.pt|you spend so much money and you
mels/020481.pt|twenty million copies this game did not sell poorly this game
mels/001164.pt|the to make meal that's not gonna be
mels/021451.pt|people were saying wow it's more valuable than apple stock
mels/005581.pt|and every single person comes back later and they're like
mels/024257.pt|can already tell where the money came from they literally got lawrence fishburne to
mels/031532.pt|moving your soldiers around and fighting and dodging and weaving and half the game is building the army he was so good at both but he's amazing at building the army but in this game
mels/007395.pt|want to play the game to know like that that
mels/017970.pt|i did on sunday made any money it was like all just
mels/024741.pt|you might notice in the beginning
mels/007117.pt|in southern watching the seasons while i do a lot of work i've been watching the seasons well i do
mels/032420.pt|yeah so i so i made that video and i said remember a few key tips it's

mels/012959.pt|if you're doing it and you're liking it
mels/029460.pt|it's bad i can tell right away this game is bad and then time keeps going by
mels/024047.pt|add marketing play to release a bad second
mels/001699.pt|the triple shifting at the laundromat and then the second the kid comes home with
mels/014406.pt|because there is no more need for someone to download edit and
mels/025144.pt|a substantial sum of money to get this
mels/017557.pt|of their company beats even mainstays like coca-cola disney
mels/007825.pt|every single person in the chat to look
mels/009178.pt|i think i'm way less aware and
mels/013656.pt|so i'm officially pioneering blazing my own trail saving mixer bringing it back dude i'm
mels/016748.pt|image in this are going to be extremely
mels/019891.pt|if it was outright said to be linear as
mels/028113.pt|with the about face clan now
mels/021908.pt|it started the most important thing about a flywheel
mels/028441.pt|my his office wasn't far from the school and he's like
mels/027247.pt|and examples of some of the ways ubisoft has been uh you know sort of
mels/025635.pt|okay it doesn't happen very often every once in a while in human history there will be a breakthrough so powerful and so dynamic that we think about life before and after you know what i'm saying well this week it was the solving of world hunger world hunger is no longer a problem after a man who goes by the name dylan figured out that you could get a six flags magic mountain annual pass for
mels/026462.pt|the stuff here so in general i think
mels/015273.pt|was combined full of amazing stuff crap stuff
mels/008743.pt|twitter and was like secretly trying to buy it they were quite concerned and didn't want him to and he was tweeting things like
mels/008464.pt|if the for another month no need to
mels/022022.pt|it's big enough that an executive at burger
mels/026475.pt|one of the things i think nvidia has
mels/002456.pt|and marketers don't often have enough actionable data on what the actual demographics of their customers
mels/003406.pt|if the that you on is that uh it's becoming
mels/021868.pt|it's to work let me figure out the good habits that make me
mels/000071.pt|i almost hope it was the first year because now we're
mels/004639.pt|all right so he calls me he's like hey
mels/027279.pt|i have leaned into it i mean they have the prepare to die edition they've had ads
mels/016202.pt|they donate to children or whatever it's like okay but can i instead of donating children
mels/026576.pt|it's been four million takes on this i'm just
mels/003021.pt|here you can see it right here this is the
mels/003617.pt|i'll roll with my dad now
mels/017586.pt|as keep their value longer than other cars and because of that this this amazing
mels/020017.pt|the number six acquisition is elon musk acquiring these hair plugs and a good night's sleep that has made him the second richest
mels/029597.pt|and his i think great competitive mentality is actually rubbing off on the
mels/003151.pt|and it just feels like meta is
mels/014035.pt|the biggest pickups in streaming history is that
mels/021982.pt|worked his ass off for 30 years
mels/030522.pt|i think she's their daughter and i'm the guy that got lumped in her
mels/020744.pt|herman the worst out of the year and when i think back to make
mels/030476.pt|but something about that question is hard
mels/015604.pt|into stuff for like ultra wealthy and then
mels/010301.pt|hours for me but i've seen a good amount of
mels/030160.pt|was game one he's like oh yeah you're complaining whatever whatever whatever you whatever whatever and
mels/027210.pt|it paid off quite handsomely so if you look this is the sales figures for all their previous games middling to no success they had adventures of cookies and cream was their best game from
mels/018672.pt|every time you bought a console they lost money that is how attractive the pricing was okay but they managed to gain market share and some
mels/002550.pt|we go ahead with again with sorry
mels/026794.pt|that's like the two targets that
mels/028097.pt|billion dollars in value was lost instantly
mels/006896.pt|how many times did you die on the hill are you asking how many times i died how many times i i died on the hill knowing as i'm sure you do that death is permanent and that if i were to have died i probably wouldn't be here right now answering the question three times
mels/007298.pt|so throughout now the first set that
mels/014527.pt|the competition breeds excellence and that's exactly what's happening
mels/014633.pt|wait for them but right now they don't have it right now
mels/022510.pt|it was something that was kind of clever but in practice i just feel like they they they lost the plot this
mels/028270.pt|as companies um until from from
mels/012742.pt|i spent 16 hours a day getting number
mels/006605.pt|give other editors their due i feel like
mels/008006.pt|yeah that's what i am dream so
mels/011180.pt|there's truth in this if your life gets
mels/007487.pt|she comes back with apparently there are two items in the menu
mels/002225.pt|raise his hand and be like
mels/007751.pt|and he thought he was faster than me
mels/011327.pt|if you need a safe place
mels/005313.pt|sit down i'm sitting next to jarvis if
mels/000197.pt|some reason he's the guy who
mels/013655.pt|or down and i said so i can right and they
mels/009789.pt|all gas heated buildings are being dropped to 17 degrees
mels/027227.pt|were confusing and more importantly is it scratches
mels/014531.pt|is that and he said a lot of wise things he said something that blew me away with its wisdom and
mels/018962.pt|the show they need to be able to watch their phone
mels/011426.pt|the a resume if you have
mels/002068.pt|no end of an era the
mels/012671.pt|steve drama didn't steve finally win a major
mels/003582.pt|is he could not buy in to stocks or housing at the incredible prices it was at it was too high so eventually you got to clear the brush out of the forest like zombie companies have to go under
mels/023455.pt|i can't because i can't raise prices i
mels/004543.pt|like i was like hey mark
mels/026283.pt|when that happens before you buy the item purchase

mels/024647.pt|estate developer was posting huge profits and was saying they were worth more every year in fact it is very rare for a company to collapse after having the previous
mels/017863.pt|good communication this kind of stuff this published area
mels/004851.pt|of times and i knew it would be which is why i put my name in the upper left of
mels/002915.pt|widespread that it was like the only place you can get a real hit and sometimes people would come to work for netflix like actors and directors because they knew it was like they could get the widest widespread that it was like the only place you could get a real hit and sometimes people would come to work for netflix like um actors and directors

mels/000776.pt|it'd be fun that's like a pretty fun idea right i think that could be a really fun idea
mels/008127.pt|and we'll call it we'll call it an even steven seagal
mels/008993.pt|in the heat dude that's that is sick and the reason i'm not laughing
mels/014838.pt|if they're they're making it very
mels/030025.pt|i want to keep dr lupo safe he's been
mels/007349.pt|to me being a game of thrones nurse that nerd
mels/020902.pt|yes you can buy a bunch of land and
mels/013876.pt|one of their games including legends of roon
mels/020161.pt|they go to frozen meat companies on twitter
mels/017828.pt|but focusing on that creating a better
mels/012325.pt|there was like these fruit cubes were
mels/017581.pt|for example nike is a is
mels/029929.pt|deal because it had not happened and we thought it couldn't happen let's watch
mels/025126.pt|the fired if you don't try this game which
mels/012157.pt|we did that was evil was like goofy
mels/010206.pt|was the effect of pepper spray upon your dick as i i must know oh i
mels/010974.pt|and you know what my mistake because it it was a slip with the tongue and it was a mistake this is not a movie is not something you just watch this isn't the and you know what my mistake because it it was a slip of the tongue and it was a mistake this is not a movie
mels/005847.pt|i saw in his eyes that he had seen that
mels/021829.pt|okay i just want that to be clear
mels/025546.pt|i just in general as a person i'm deeply
mels/020374.pt|pretty solid one yeah this is a bad
mels/022962.pt|at fortnite and that is the rest of their company it's not even
mels/023920.pt|and i think i have let's see i'm going through wins and fails
mels/028939.pt|but he was laughing about it and
mels/005139.pt|well let me tell you uh
mels/024145.pt|it's by the rise of mixer and youtube youtube was doing big contracts for
mels/002751.pt|google engineers that work on the
mels/030181.pt|it's like it's like this okay there was a bunch of these for um for all the
mels/021988.pt|is optimized all of his uh
mels/000726.pt|the high point i think that was the final hurrah and
mels/016633.pt|and i don't think it's because of our sex appeal
mels/004047.pt|have but we'll see i feel fine
mels/008651.pt|oh big nobody's ever done a deal quite this big and just said nah not paying like that's basically what
mels/029463.pt|when i'm like okay yeah cuber was great what about the
mels/021556.pt|i would be careful because the next one you hear about on wall street is going
mels/015783.pt|there's like a hundred more small services like there's like dc universe online there's
mels/014669.pt|no reason i don't understand why
mels/024920.pt|and you you want to follow up that you
mels/002191.pt|it's not really like a job if you love what you do
mels/005386.pt|and have it just was like a real and time is money you understand if there was some way i could trade crypto whilst i was getting my
mels/016295.pt|well i didn't really know what to make of them
mels/024826.pt|i like if you're a new whale to a game there
mels/022966.pt|with the epic store wouldn't change it and in fact apple sort of ripped into
mels/008374.pt|i talk about banks we talked about it on the
mels/016328.pt|dogs in here you know so you guys you guys make up your own mind on wins
mels/032425.pt|you seem like someone who has placed too much of
mels/008818.pt|forty percent because he first started talking about
mels/000093.pt|it's react meta is my full uploaded vod of my
mels/012932.pt|actually very powerful and very but i didn't
mels/026324.pt|remember how i said verizon spends three
mels/016974.pt|it's the water we'll put on the keys
mels/014566.pt|albert it's like only in weird 30
mels/019320.pt|this is a little more of a
mels/021450.pt|the or even like let's say
mels/030768.pt|as very nice i just don't know
mels/012945.pt|wizard did a bunch of layoffs including some friends that i know
mels/006082.pt|good for melee their next matchup
mels/031785.pt|that holds the new twitch together the arrival of the hot tub meta it turns out should be called the arrival of the amaranth meta because looking back at this last month
mels/031751.pt|what a golden graham is and we would all know
mels/005522.pt|i you know what i love my family so whatever it's
mels/000521.pt|and we open the big wide doors
mels/021599.pt|we single month saying they made more money telling wall street
mels/027100.pt|if you look at the roman republic even after they went to
mels/000684.pt|we get there and they take us to this little room it's very well decorated it's got like cool prints in the
mels/032301.pt|i love that too it's just the nature of i think creating stuff or the nature of the human condition
mels/023717.pt|in a parody of real commercials i would have if they could
mels/018110.pt|it took a tour of america this is how japan sees america dude the
mels/023517.pt|who have a lot of money the average ferrari owner
mels/024682.pt|in millions if i bought a million shares
mels/026173.pt|hey what do you do when your name your brand name is
mels/026719.pt|it's console wars video microsoft is a when it comes to gaming is a game
mels/017986.pt|it's up to like three now
mels/023728.pt|three things that i actually do love about these headphones number one look at
mels/012866.pt|it's like in sophomore year and early junior
mels/017559.pt|and the most valuable brand in the world okay so how did they get their brand to be worth so much more than everyone else's including other big tech companies that have you know massive scale and most people think it's advertising people think
mels/015885.pt|because they can't double the price otherwise it's not really a bundle at all it's just buying them both and if they cut the price they have to figure out who's taking the cut who's losing money because right now they get
mels/001529.pt|i assume they're like a 12 year old
mels/001829.pt|be affordable and so and to make it work
mels/023008.pt|well never cut our deal for anyone
mels/011599.pt|and just like we all understood
mels/023282.pt|i literally couldn't do it but i i will say some people can a hundred
mels/011427.pt|you know yeah you can for sure we're always looking
mels/020567.pt|it's one thing but i mean but it's not out but if they say i bought your game and you ripped me off
mels/027393.pt|oh we're suing them and that would have been an appropriate response even if it was just her name and likeness but actually the game was called kim kardashian sex tape
mels/028529.pt|so i go it's by the way it's like the end of tax season this was for previous years taxes but
mels/003265.pt|well stock you just walking up to the counter at
mels/030621.pt|cause they have a different power system so the one thing i wanted in this world
mels/004009.pt|worse but i'm going to play with him tomorrow
mels/007701.pt|i'm not going to the topic yet
mels/018842.pt|oh inspired by a true story why I
mels/005526.pt|yes how is your jumper i have not played
mels/022126.pt|put it lightly pretty irresponsible this guy's
mels/019153.pt|with a little bit more knowledge on what
mels/021615.pt|this is a football they don't really make
mels/024037.pt|but my honest opinion is that their goal was just to say something so they
mels/007562.pt|i like tournament if you google phantom
mels/027454.pt|as weekend when she literally dropped the
mels/004905.pt|little fingers and then began to say that he was going to basically acquire the rest of the company and just keep growing his share
mels/010591.pt|and there's probably only one power in the world that could save us the power of song and so maybe just maybe
mels/013231.pt|i think was we all knew
mels/019477.pt|it's a marketer's dream you come up with
mels/006513.pt|i now pay later services you spend more than you would have you buy more clothes you buy more shoes you buy more travel you buy more whatever you buy more than you think
mels/030956.pt|and let's start over nice to meet you where
mels/014024.pt|let me get a song oh you know what i got
mels/002560.pt|am i need it very very quickly you know how
mels/026007.pt|they have of many many crimes and likely uh will
mels/016461.pt|they applied for small businesses in order to keep on their employees and did not keep on the employees
mels/018239.pt|why did they hire the devil to play the child that was an interesting choice why get damien from the omen
mels/017655.pt|second thing on the purchase part of the clock is packaging packaging so apple has been an
mels/014891.pt|i think i hear from these guys it doesn't
mels/031802.pt|freight train and blew up massively these are the three
mels/021749.pt|i played league of legends in college
mels/003267.pt|seven days the god it's all it's interesting i think
mels/008669.pt|your own i was going to like find something to
mels/024231.pt|in my painting days were over how far
mels/022059.pt|i thought this is a good ass
mels/017919.pt|where's through one avenue you're watching the
mels/014246.pt|ways to do this and that's why i think twitch would have been fine letting
mels/022353.pt|read on the back of the box and actually understand number two they have a variety of cool scents like grapefruit
mels/000410.pt|i'm jumping up running across the
mels/009390.pt|is that crazy to say i think of this entire group the best
mels/028187.pt|that let me try and explain it
mels/015446.pt|the sequel but i don't think it's going to
mels/021141.pt|you're trying to maintain but if
mels/002980.pt|is the smartest thing i've ever seen no one's going to watch
mels/004228.pt|it would have prevented more scams at the height of the scammy period but doing it now is like
mels/025400.pt|no commentary necessary let's all watch this and if you think it's a win spam w
mels/011710.pt|we drive we get there we get off in
mels/000901.pt|i gave you the world i said pick anything in this world that you want that i can possibly get user
mels/015526.pt|i mean that everyone else is doing it they don't really have a purpose no i'm not being
mels/007942.pt|i think of the resub sulky spulk thank you
mels/009792.pt|so they can't get natural gas from russia which is a good thing i mean it's good that they're having some economic sanction to
mels/023699.pt|that's funny yep cause they always they
mels/011707.pt|ari speaks spanish and so like
mels/016341.pt|in north korea for their country's first missile launch
mels/014339.pt|is that they launched house of cards and started making shows every year and now it's become the majority of their business now netflix originals are like the way they they pioneer so they need to become
mels/021259.pt|the most desired product on the face of the planet we also have the
mels/001237.pt|to like charlie emilio and she couldn't use herself in the ad that
mels/023698.pt|and that always go yep they go yep yep
mels/013943.pt|every month it's the exact same with buy not
mels/018952.pt|but the problem and this is the bold take people said all the ads were annoying
mels/030726.pt|we're going to end with the
mels/008104.pt|it was powerful i feel like i really
mels/025483.pt|a lot of money i did a win
mels/012850.pt|were dropped n a mid later
mels/008622.pt|if the for being an idiot and twitter is hurt because
mels/031951.pt|it was probably the weekend so
mels/028117.pt|would include snoop dogg they were gonna
mels/020463.pt|has shed over 30 percent of their value
mels/016615.pt|this problem or doing deeper research on it because it is a
mels/013842.pt|if you get it out on position
mels/010494.pt|i want the finishing of the season i actually
mels/006772.pt|all day and i read that text
mels/029806.pt|and you know i kind of like looked up to you as like
mels/025807.pt|above and beyond riot in terms of creative diversity and maturity of
mels/019606.pt|if they didn't even they didn't provide the music they provided just the words
mels/000766.pt|the strippers and instead of you know
mels/004701.pt|i'm not sure that's the best solution it is a
mels/026260.pt|this past year massive money printed by the
mels/003336.pt|so we'll see i mean that could collapse the
mels/018543.pt|owning bethesda is part of that their goal is to dominate the cloud and they will stop at nothing okay
mels/023560.pt|the for a belt because for you the perceived
mels/021298.pt|okay the pandemic was massive for twitch and youtube and
mels/002527.pt|it's easy clap i would advise you to even but you could push your luck and go for
mels/032327.pt|getting some of this stuff they cannot imagine that anyone else could do it anyone who has completed both knows the
mels/022317.pt|the voice we knew we had to go uber big on all taco
mels/010915.pt|the through a little bit again
mels/022728.pt|right i mean when they got
mels/028566.pt|i had already paid taxes on it
mels/000391.pt|and so because he lives in vegas and we know
mels/013261.pt|one twitch you're not on twitch like that
mels/000869.pt|go to the right we sing the iconic erratic
mels/022088.pt|terrible brand tweets i look forward to seeing the one or two brands every year that think they can make a
mels/020421.pt|bold of you to assume i'm sorry most of you aren't snowmen there's a lot of good coke commercials
mels/003224.pt|even in their own white people said that
mels/028825.pt|the city you go live in your
mels/024523.pt|we power here but success is not a crime and so unfortunately the judge was not really keen on enforcing this kind of thing even though the judge seemed to agree in
mels/001258.pt|i think he's one of the most funny
mels/021575.pt|i get carrots for 10 bucks and you're like okay deal
mels/023267.pt|and i was like i was i was getting mad at her i was like babe i'm sorry to break it to
mels/032080.pt|we had months we had months in advance to write it by the way but thank you for the intro
mels/021269.pt|if numbers are absolutely fraudulent at this point at this point i've looked at enough of their reports to realize that it makes no sense they're putting
mels/025451.pt|what have wanted that's the first win of the day let me
mels/012955.pt|really time consuming and not only does it cost you money but during that time you could probably be working and making money so you're
mels/012159.pt|what a different team in charge of that that
mels/016853.pt|and comfortable uh predicting it but uh
mels/008237.pt|didn't have deep deep deep deeply entrenched corporate interests on both sides
mels/023053.pt|i have as much money and at which point when they've lost the ability to like you know make a bunch of money
mels/028585.pt|on this shirt okay well let me tell you before i joined twitch i attempted to become a professional league of legends player
mels/015695.pt|it now but first i'd like to do a quick question from our friends at lily bank
mels/030839.pt|like something about how i'm always wearing tank tops on stream no that's not why i'm not wearing one
mels/025016.pt|well as and they're all negative and they're always like the developer but here's an example of one that would be classified as
mels/003671.pt|they succeed anyway like even though the
mels/023622.pt|the important part my fiance likes it here's proof okay
mels/031513.pt|this is the finale of brood war basically the way a team match works in
mels/016213.pt|i know that i talk about marketing you don't have to tell me
mels/018470.pt|oh boy i'll see you in
mels/021216.pt|i stuck with the mandalorian and all their
mels/017410.pt|in the state of journalism today okay that being said i'm a gigantic jake and
mels/002048.pt|where clear about what it is that i'm looking for girl now normally when i go and check
mels/005152.pt|are offered that we should go and so we did and we went
mels/015323.pt|money by the standards of any other studio in
mels/001158.pt|i feel like i can say this it should be fine i want you guys to know that they don't talk about it but the
mels/002274.pt|came back from the dead today
mels/000625.pt|one of the nights i was thinking like
mels/014099.pt|this time it's personal i don't want to leak
mels/015094.pt|our stuff and we're going to put it online ourselves luckily making your own streaming
mels/024021.pt|i think it's pretty well backed up but what i've
mels/003345.pt|no matter what the economic report comes out on thursday the fact is is that since things have gotten more expensive there is a lot of evidence
mels/013399.pt|it was voice it was just magical i don't believe my eyes your name will
mels/025363.pt|the tough like well this might just
mels/006123.pt|do this like it was planned but then this ev this this
mels/017753.pt|on this on on marketing monday in general but i can absolutely be impressed by some of the investments they've made in
mels/019253.pt|of money for this and then saw it and said let's spend a ton of money for this and then saw it
mels/029897.pt|you leave early attractive go hang out
mels/016241.pt|taught about who is taking w's and who is taking l's this week in marketing
mels/027525.pt|we're hard numbers and what i found out is they have i mean not only expensive employee salaries but they have this they have an r
mels/024006.pt|true to the matter is all of the matter is
mels/023563.pt|but for the same people you might be like oh my god a new valerian skin
mels/016989.pt|and the the relationship they have
mels/001245.pt|what would you do if you saw me on your shelf and i looked at you
mels/010966.pt|it looks like a minion and win a bunch of stuff
mels/006743.pt|where's my phone dude i got the funniest
mels/026969.pt|work at the end this is like a depressing ad
mels/027118.pt|then right around the pandemic it spiked at a
mels/008502.pt|if musk backs out can i buy twitter musk
mels/027972.pt|for the player base significantly that means this guy has skin artists
mels/024781.pt|it is now officially a habit in your brain that is difficult to break next thing they'll do and this was baffling i
mels/018837.pt|really care and also the beers like never featured outside of these two people who don't know what's going on in his head they just look at him and smile it's
mels/028099.pt|be that a company i invested in
mels/008498.pt|what's there's not that many i
mels/006919.pt|with the blends anonymous balloons anonymous
mels/018353.pt|okay don't show up the interview would say hey what's your vacation policy always get to the phase where they're like right there okay don't show up the interview and say hey what's your vacation policy
mels/009362.pt|well over a calendar a year ago that i
mels/032199.pt|player player player winning money making good money
mels/014390.pt|which is genius that's very smart of
mels/032249.pt|he gets the banker cards he flips
mels/004346.pt|thanks you you're interested in i don't subscribe to the bloons
mels/023027.pt|it'll be like look who knows what could happen who knows
mels/019875.pt|empty it always feels like it doesn't have enough because you have your scrappy team trying to build this gigantic world
mels/013464.pt|you shouldn't be humble that's just rude
mels/014345.pt|on youtube is much bigger twitch needs to grow and it needs to grow out of just the gaming niche community the hardcore
mels/000307.pt|the same pattern friday night it's about even the good saturday night i make a bunch of money saturday night we're always up and then sunday night the casino always takes it back
mels/023478.pt|and through advertising that's why they spend the most of
mels/030466.pt|at it so i was like so i pulled my shirt up at the on the beach and it said will you and then i turned around and then
mels/030309.pt|of his wedding i was like yeah i was the sigma man is what i was
mels/027593.pt|i think this is a very short-term answer
mels/031150.pt|the only thing i have a problem with was the the saying only three thousand
mels/023887.pt|in the mango we're gonna watch
mels/015808.pt|but they're they're on the way out
mels/032430.pt|and change your ways thank you
mels/023356.pt|we love it it's great and what that means is we will do it right up until we don't need to microsoft is offering one of the best value deals of all time with um the game pass and
mels/015248.pt|and there's a big spike in hulu around
mels/028338.pt|now i'm watching everyone in the area
mels/018762.pt|doesn't really matter the cool thing about flex factor in marketing is that it doesn't matter if it's ugly or beautiful as long as you can tell that it's expensive again i'm getting a very strong iphone versus android vibe here
mels/018686.pt|confusing and stupid especially i mean look
mels/002868.pt|one strategy of dragging the trial out is also seeming to be unlikely because the
mels/006763.pt|i did not know by the way that my grandmother even watched oh man where is it
mels/025928.pt|marketplace and they have simply apparently no time or effort to invest in in growing and updating the
mels/024651.pt|is this isolated to just evergrand the
mels/008122.pt|wait for black history month actually appreciate
mels/014280.pt|well friends i switch over pokey okay cool
mels/019168.pt|yeah it's not close and if you're the underdog in marketing you have to find a way to be distinct you cannot yes and you cannot be
mels/007116.pt|clip and then i watched the season
mels/029246.pt|i'd go back if i could
mels/020289.pt|the content of the ad and not the fact that it was literally like next pixel
mels/027871.pt|and as it turns out when you can't borrow money
mels/008468.pt|are not keeping the stream going but i do appreciate your humbleness your
mels/028356.pt|a psychopath so he just takes his son and leaves he just laughs about it takes his son and leaves he never plays again with our group dj wheat never came to the group and
mels/014616.pt|recently has been outside of the west or at least outside of like america
mels/026388.pt|if they didn't you couldn't tell they were new and that's why i think every new iphone from now on will have something done
mels/027961.pt|go on is the movie event of the millennium and so director louis
mels/015126.pt|yet until netflix looked at the data for for streaming so they uh so they release house of
mels/017461.pt|i wonder if i have a good explanation
mels/013138.pt|every media company is trying to become everything like they want to have their
mels/022579.pt|and they just called it dreamcraft
mels/026175.pt|what do you do well there's one option this is
mels/000968.pt|fight a tiger and there's not
mels/029570.pt|east coast style west coast all this stuff
mels/010074.pt|i want i want to give them free advertising after they but they
mels/026509.pt|we option they said oh we picked the first one well like we want that first one
mels/027751.pt|future and Fortune to slightly increase
mels/020809.pt|and you may know me from doing unimportant things like playing children's games for money
mels/008835.pt|well because after he made the insanely overpriced offer
mels/011616.pt|do one honeymoon which was sad
mels/032331.pt|there is zero chance he completed whatever had not finished naga forestry with his there is zero chance he completed whatever he had not finished in hog before his
mels/015897.pt|every monopoly would we and there this is
mels/019205.pt|facts message boards and I would talk
mels/024720.pt|in their life getting stocks and bonds and houses can stay rich that is basically what's happening you kind of want some correction at some
mels/021522.pt|the people and you know i think it's inappropriate
mels/018173.pt|welcome to the world's first and greatest marketing tuesday look i made a little logo for it today's marketing monday topic marketing tuesday i'm sorry
mels/019666.pt|and then made the song the hook and everything
mels/029432.pt|i wanna talk to you again because like he really liked me this guy
mels/020033.pt|two billion and that's why zuck like fears google zuckerberg is trying to own vr because
mels/027736.pt|know how um our favorite person in the world
mels/029222.pt|is like all right i got a job for you
mels/032350.pt|with the developer next to me
mels/004319.pt|well would be my guest why why would you think that
mels/004571.pt|i famously sold because i was so confident that
mels/010392.pt|i called and i begged today i did this um and i said hey anything please please
mels/016855.pt|i know what to do if you learn about ai you will make money i know that from just
mels/016932.pt|this possible by the way even if you're not going to work in any one of those industries you can still see price appreciation and value appreciation by investing in those industries that's
mels/028302.pt|if like if if someone did ask like
mels/001886.pt|to become profitable amazon is pushing them
mels/032148.pt|i see rochelle ari's with me
mels/032288.pt|the edge so that that that that is the end of it and thank god so i'm sort of like at a pretty i'm like damn i lost i lost everything i mean i lost i lost every my entire limit i didn't i
mels/001577.pt|you said it with a smile and a smirk
mels/025654.pt|your investment in three hours by five it was worth nearly three thousand dollars a coin by
mels/016082.pt|as well as the episodes themselves
mels/025982.pt|starting with a win okay we start off
mels/025987.pt|the immediately saying they were in poor judgment and they already announced from executives saying that
mels/012757.pt|you gotta figure out like well you gotta
mels/007257.pt|it's a meme and i and if
mels/007952.pt|yeah smiley face i am and then
mels/023501.pt|the the strategy of scarcity to get artificially increased their
mels/008748.pt|like if you're trying to buy a company and
mels/018667.pt|while competition its competition was xbox and
mels/005197.pt|the whole thing is interesting i think it was pretty fun
mels/031005.pt|for most of the thing and then whenever i told him i was staying when when my
mels/018215.pt|the rip it's a very creative idea to
mels/011439.pt|and then i popped it out and so it was it was kind of an epic moment like it was kind of really cool
mels/020527.pt|there they have to do insanely quick bug
mels/019207.pt|i remember I would go home and like argue
mels/031560.pt|with his back against the wall and that
mels/011632.pt|and so i thought you know be hype is what if we did that
mels/010305.pt|as i'm not gonna ask him on
mels/009395.pt|the overall better you know the goat of north america but
mels/031125.pt|nowadays it's getting different but when
mels/007355.pt|three of melee has hated playing like mew2king
mels/012537.pt|like all right so you have to tap your little data pad your little you have a wristband that opens all the doors and like unlocks based on your
mels/014767.pt|personally i don't think it's possible twitch chat
mels/021155.pt|at crying laughing emoji but i was laughing that's some of the deaths and
mels/028946.pt|so i had a great time in the school and i also had a great time doing
mels/020080.pt|it's a ton of money twitch still loses money and is being sued by a million record labels the greatest acquisition of all time what is number one is it minecraft poggies is it
mels/008840.pt|like three times as much as it's worth is overpaying ah with less money so obviously he wants the bad he was the get out as much like three times as much as it's worth he's overpaying uh with less money
mels/024998.pt|i'm so there's gotta be wouldn't you want or need coffee with a 16 hour night virginia hates
mels/024192.pt|on where this uh stream wars goes because
mels/024951.pt|i thought i would never play this game let alone
mels/001034.pt|there's probably somebody who lives and breathes
mels/004140.pt|isn't that all the messages are going through so that he can so i can actually like
mels/009625.pt|i'm playing for 10 years i'll
mels/016049.pt|various grinding on streaming i've got a bunch of big plans
mels/013932.pt|owed money exactly on time with no missed payments
mels/018565.pt|my first marketing monday xbox one was a total disaster
mels/013936.pt|your payments if you are delayed for any reason the fees that you will accrue
mels/018312.pt|get exactly what it's about it sounds like you just saw an ad on the internet and said
mels/009857.pt|i mean it's probably not true but
mels/003389.pt|at the terminator situation where magnus carlsen
mels/013113.pt|with the three how are y'all doing what is happening i
mels/019250.pt|top and then every girl will
mels/020068.pt|we could get made irrelevant now number two is of course the louisiana purchase how could i not
mels/010224.pt|give me a heads up so i uh i can make
mels/000112.pt|it's really nice stuff and he's coming so that's cool
mels/032192.pt|on saturday i swear to god they might have demolished the venetian oh
mels/023324.pt|he recognized us and then he offhandedly said oh yeah i made safe
mels/008331.pt|it's like a little trick of the trade
mels/029877.pt|was you weren't there was like a canadian tournament and i was talking to mango like after the tournament or whatever and i dunno how you came up like i was talking about i was prior with it twice was you weren't there it was like a canadian tournament and i was talking to mango like after the tournament or whatever
mels/005037.pt|i can you feel good that day you
mels/021357.pt|classic short squeeze what's a short
mels/015372.pt|because they're just not as attractive the best
mels/027399.pt|why this happened with youtube it
mels/022637.pt|those are actual bleeps those are actual
mels/017620.pt|the product volume the amount of product of
mels/014337.pt|what is that they didn't make their own so he's like we need to learn how to do that before
mels/019163.pt|things that would be a lie obviously
mels/019588.pt|are going but was too lazy now instead of looking flying
mels/007367.pt|you can see it during the
mels/024372.pt|about the film by chanel let's watch the film and again all of us in chat
mels/016972.pt|thank you guys for enjoying marketing money
mels/011535.pt|i just think we could live in a world where we could just write off weebs you know
mels/015726.pt|what do you have a general idea of like how the streaming services differ what their strengths and
mels/026364.pt|for and use images of martin luther king and
mels/032294.pt|it but but you know if you put that many hours into some you feel a certain sense of as i think blizzard called it
mels/024189.pt|i think that might be it for wins
mels/001818.pt|i'm like a god if it was called living gods
mels/014991.pt|with every demographic even except for old people
mels/021390.pt|what market value was at but right around here the shorts started getting so severe and they were doing a lot of things to pressure the stock to go down okay and it got more and more shorted and they got more and more money and they got
mels/031957.pt|behind the scenes behind the scenes was super funny slime
mels/020020.pt|it's a tough fit let's just see if we can put this on i'm
mels/014282.pt|if they get s3k the war is over
mels/004745.pt|it's before i was a twitter shareholder
mels/010408.pt|still better than spectrum yeah i mean even even having
mels/019368.pt|i ran the quarter six gambit i spent on everything i spent all night not playing league for once and i looked at what every competitor was doing in every market and i tried to buy better
mels/032215.pt|five minutes in because we can't wait
mels/027546.pt|if you ask around twitter shareholders nobody believes that the other reason is that the management of twitter wants to keep their job they're
mels/014421.pt|and seeing who emerges victorious and
mels/020145.pt|right in the middle ground it's funny it stands out
mels/024860.pt|i don't like they're unique do they
mels/020982.pt|because the guy has no pants
mels/026478.pt|if the fails of the past week and as usual a lot of my wins and fails mostly fails
mels/003496.pt|there's like economic reasons but basically it's it was cheaper to make it in taiwan and so they got very good at it and the infrastructure to make chips is extremely expensive like you need
mels/010654.pt|which class and again i have
mels/022188.pt|life hack if you're a marketer because we love dogs there's an art to it
mels/028803.pt|i thought this is a huge exaggeration i
mels/019402.pt|i said he'd never seen the castle before this is in the game the game gave you this castle in the alps which was such a flex dude
mels/022969.pt|and the fortnight money's going down
mels/012789.pt|he's like no but i can make a strategy i'll never think of and his strategy was
mels/004823.pt|i think about it so i really appreciate mr musk
mels/012540.pt|thanks again for your help earlier today or what
mels/021318.pt|these trends are real okay you look at it look at rust
mels/009445.pt|if they lost remember if you're not
mels/001159.pt|because they haven't got a sponsor yet so but they literally they eat it
mels/024343.pt|it's union yeah it probably is a better name because you kind of
mels/018743.pt|and my theory which i think has been
mels/003667.pt|what if the son or daughter of the
mels/021904.pt|and i don't want to work out and if i don't work out then i stay up
mels/026181.pt|against the robot uprising in five years when tesla's self-driving cars go to war with the rest of us rats with guns on exercise balls is the best we've got that's the
mels/016370.pt|in taxpayer dollars went to the right place this is his first interview in his role as the head of the pandemic response
mels/005363.pt|he's not stopping so i start doing the thing where you're like like look
mels/016440.pt|because this email got leaked that said why gas price increases is good for hiring and it basically said the advantage for us is that
mels/026560.pt|him he's just trying to buy
mels/004769.pt|and at the same time the big elephant in the room started happening which was
mels/006831.pt|there isn't any popping sounds but what you can do is get 10 hours of
mels/011090.pt|sphinx man and i can't find his name what was his name
mels/000547.pt|and nick was uh was autumn
mels/020957.pt|well if they double down i get hardened
mels/010508.pt|be honest i know you will be
mels/022974.pt|this is why i sort of side with epic in general is because they're not a company that has too much weight to throw around anymore not as much they're still powerful and
mels/015580.pt|isn't your tv it's very popular roku
mels/002753.pt|and the algorithm do not get to compete you already make enough money at google congratulations to
mels/000311.pt|we all agree okay we all shake
mels/008431.pt|if i can get someone to do it actually it's probably a funny idea
mels/001650.pt|literally 30 years i didn't like cats
mels/016017.pt|no one will give you money people are afraid
mels/001586.pt|you'll have to take a guess what are you thinking number
mels/026816.pt|so facebook is looking at a very disgustingly bad next 10 years where
mels/021391.pt|and they kept shorting it because
mels/004206.pt|i do really appreciate it thank you
mels/028902.pt|oh and everything's kind of cramped
mels/008973.pt|by the company they can't change the company okay so like you know if i agree to buy your car and in writing i say i'm gonna buy it as is no matter what but you can't
mels/003736.pt|in the united citizens united was a very terrible terrible supreme court ruling i believe that basically said that corporations are people too and
mels/026762.pt|to you know figure out their next few
mels/029784.pt|i oh what else did i want to
mels/014122.pt|if so high because those type of numbers don't work like at all so that's where we
mels/030480.pt|or propose right at the beginning of dinner
mels/011705.pt|way like the map says go that way that's
mels/006499.pt|in the very short term it's a win because i got to watch klarna and
mels/027220.pt|these and all that so this is an example of l
mels/032401.pt|in the dark but i didn't do it it's really weird not this he was
mels/012397.pt|it was cool because we were like in bed or it was like near night and the alarms
mels/027653.pt|it means for the future there is a real chance that five years from now twitter has to
mels/010924.pt|a little higher end factor's more like quick
mels/005357.pt|so i assume that he's head nodding
mels/010418.pt|lily's garden game theory that is such a random string of words that you put together it's obviously david thank you
mels/006458.pt|not one of these games not a single one of these games
mels/005760.pt|like quick quick jokes just chatting always keep
mels/010336.pt|when to engineering needs a laptop that has
mels/001528.pt|exactly yes i start out easy because i
mels/005371.pt|wave back that guy didn't wave back because i knew he wasn't waving at me and jarvis
mels/030217.pt|of the slide before me i dove down the slide and i tapped the ground after the slide before
mels/018435.pt|do together then they also have by far the most games uh-oh turns out
mels/006443.pt|was horrific dystopia the most horrific gaming dystopia i could imagine
mels/028584.pt|i'm gonna tell a story of this shirt you might be wondering
mels/027093.pt|inflation on the rise and should we be concerned about it well let me take that
mels/019461.pt|well that's just dumb you thought
mels/005297.pt|a girl came up to me and started crying because of taking a photo and i was like lady i'm a i'm a marketing manager at a tech company she was crying she was legitimately shaking and crying
mels/012402.pt|while everyone's like getting out of their beds and going down the hallways and everyone's going to the
mels/004289.pt|one little speaker crackling and then you can't understand me and then you're like oh i wish
mels/017131.pt|that'd be the slung what a beautiful song what a
mels/008713.pt|was dramatically higher like over half of all things
mels/001340.pt|yeah i built it strong into code but probably
mels/012585.pt|was on disney and i felt like it was good omen
mels/002111.pt|can happen and the companies are scared of
mels/020934.pt|it did a little bit better and made a bunch of money because no one's going into it less competitive so going for opportunity first things that jump out to you and making a little bit of money and some connections and getting established helps when you want
mels/029711.pt|as a melee player that would be in my head like because if
mels/014184.pt|something with twitch so there's things that they
mels/005552.pt|r rp house the same place the
mels/006450.pt|this is wild this is wild and it is so powerful and i can't wait
mels/013377.pt|that way we start with some of the worst ones and get to one of the best ones oh my god is he a genius or just a marketer wait there's no difference
mels/026729.pt|is do anything possible to get people on the platform and then once you have enough then you have the scale
mels/026338.pt|i can create a story that is not a typical tech ceo outlook especially back in
mels/001179.pt|i think it's worth checking out if if it's in your financial space and you can get
mels/013155.pt|it's no one's gonna watch it's
mels/007369.pt|cause i can't remember i i haven't seen the actual footage i
mels/014960.pt|at the cost of upgrading my pc i could
mels/015736.pt|i have lots of the great example tesla i did it for ted lasso is a great example ted i did
mels/019709.pt|yeah dude unless you hire unless you at
mels/003306.pt|because as of yesterday the white house put out a new definition of recession
mels/011774.pt|i don't believe you're from now huda
mels/016529.pt|to kicked off the beginning of the modern esports era starcraft 2 was the first
mels/002266.pt|we type the ascii art of pop
mels/001730.pt|there's like everyone's like having just
mels/022856.pt|they recommend to the public if you should buy or sell or hold a stock and they looked at all of his recommendations they realized
mels/027755.pt|well there's no there's absolutely no way this
mels/010335.pt|the goat for like if you're trying to hit that college audience
mels/030303.pt|man you know what i'm saying will you have melee set up to the reception
mels/001346.pt|well it's paradise looks amazing triscuit thank
mels/017933.pt|doing terribly there are probably teams with bad lazy
mels/016411.pt|the french guy that noticed that when gold
mels/016693.pt|the the great app for commuting is
mels/007402.pt|i even though i bought it i just think some people didn't
mels/007892.pt|it was like if it was a powerful
mels/012854.pt|was in college but i was doing really badly and
mels/014592.pt|there are never going to lose face they're always
mels/009441.pt|this is a much better duelist
mels/004502.pt|if anyone can watch it whenever it's their birthday
mels/024418.pt|up but let's get a win going here i saw
mels/022523.pt|let's actually cover this right now i think the mark of a good april
mels/002097.pt|that most of your decisions are basically coin flips that sounds sick i love that
mels/001095.pt|i made a bunch of friends i went
mels/006397.pt|which loaned its own employees thousands
mels/022620.pt|don't get banned get ron's who is this
mels/022799.pt|we're the right to spend 50 billion
mels/025302.pt|that's mango if there's anybody who's
mels/020886.pt|is off the ground is going to be more stressful
mels/000255.pt|it is the reason that i hated scooby
mels/015989.pt|is anything good for consumers competition competition is good for consumers that's why right now in streaming services you're getting like
mels/008143.pt|clarence thomas and me in a chimps off
mels/003683.pt|and they've gotten way good at getting around it
mels/005514.pt|plenty plenty of problems with the gas prices no doubt no doubt the gas prices were
mels/023685.pt|we are workers it's a it's golden it's it's guaranteed likes just tweet anything that uber and lyft
mels/016527.pt|or even starting to be born
mels/006280.pt|and if you guys made a
mels/003165.pt|to be a little while before we're really
mels/022388.pt|what i'm trying to say is and again i guess there was one can early on but there's
mels/023035.pt|for two reasons one they're just bigger they're just stronger and in general um the
mels/000107.pt|i thought about it i thought about it and i
mels/028050.pt|for the amazon labor union so they couldn't even repeat their victory for their second whereas the only got one warehouse we will see how it plays out i'm i'm i'm hoping and praying that the the for the amazon labor union so they couldn't even repeat their victory for their second warehouse they only got one warehouse we
mels/009498.pt|we're coming up clutch there mr
mels/020213.pt|was me i have to shower
mels/020105.pt|the fort for a little bit and then he held it out until he died once he was in
mels/027156.pt|guaranteed or you can print a bunch more money to band-aid it and
mels/026394.pt|know that it's the new one which which again
mels/017613.pt|extremely expensive luxury temple to the brand if you
mels/022051.pt|well because again mostly with social it's an act to try and not
mels/018754.pt|the friends as long as their friends know they did it and that's why i promise you i promise you whatever apple's next phone is
mels/016022.pt|it can become you what would that mean i i have to get
mels/018561.pt|both sides are releasing everything on
mels/027633.pt|like a dollars he has a few billion dollars and he has a lot of tesla stock and if
mels/003536.pt|huge price cuts for the first time in a while or you're seeing actual price cuts you're seeing less bidding wars you're you're
mels/010723.pt|lots of money but then you tell the editors you're paying them an exposure
mels/007761.pt|the the shower i put on my public hoodie i didn't put on
mels/031851.pt|the thousands of employees puts on a gigantic production with a massive budget 15 casters
mels/009064.pt|pretend there's music playing right now
mels/014201.pt|it's a better way to think it's
mels/019393.pt|we determine on a game level what stuff was most valuable like an actual match-up chart and we
mels/027386.pt|what they have to they have to because roblox is that big
mels/018494.pt|who tend to stick to a few number of games this one
mels/000494.pt|the it's the but but in that moment all i needed was sweet relief so i
mels/012885.pt|in that respect it's still the degrees can be valuable but
mels/022803.pt|america online is making it easier called america online play
mels/016414.pt|whoever is closest to those in power when money is when new money is printed that causes inflation
mels/007585.pt|at the time i'd do it again i'm gonna go to
mels/003579.pt|and and like i said i mean again in the short term a recession is awful it's just there's
mels/014947.pt|so if you don't use an account then willy link
mels/021320.pt|okay because creators played it that is huge amounts of money in their pocket and people are noticing that game developers are realizing that streamers can make or break your game my prediction is that streamers
mels/013240.pt|but i heard it got better as the season went on i
mels/031595.pt|when i was 18 years old
mels/007147.pt|you shouldn't nobody wants to get it even if you're not going to kill me
mels/002705.pt|now well over six rolls we are not well over six
mels/027405.pt|this past week was uh tax tax week tax day
mels/011006.pt|the chimps in two hours i can't do all the rain i can do fall
mels/023084.pt|at the chip to snack on you got the munchies how do they stand out marketing okay so
mels/021997.pt|they followed it with significantly less
mels/003418.pt|again it would lead to more defenses on the taiwan mainland and the real battle that's happening right now is for
mels/020731.pt|based tweet deserved brand tweet of the
mels/021295.pt|improve vod or discoverability at all as a former
mels/006438.pt|but you're feeling optimistic in the distance you hear a faint blockchain
mels/029903.pt|we are to actually be friends and thank god for
mels/013684.pt|literally one of the worst ceos you
mels/014518.pt|is another one i was thinking of but
mels/014496.pt|will do whatever the shroud fired you
mels/025882.pt|hundred times the next day and
mels/000378.pt|well that i'm down because after that we go back to the casino
mels/016186.pt|it take too long but i think it's
mels/024271.pt|the kia you know what i'm saying it's like
mels/009873.pt|much harder i could get from like london to i
mels/027767.pt|in a diverse mix of his
mels/028186.pt|i smash fan you don't know anything about
mels/025570.pt|we're going to have cool keyboards
mels/028110.pt|unfortunately i got scooped by ludwig
mels/023476.pt|but in the end it's all they're both trying to raise this perceived value so
mels/020472.pt|one the console and a lot of people were hyped
mels/025206.pt|and anniversary event recently apparently they were so stingy it was like the stingiest anniversary
mels/024906.pt|wong psychological hook just doing some kind of effort and then getting a randomized reward and if you combine those two
mels/029022.pt|your ass asthma gold beat your ass
mels/016475.pt|it is not to praise him it is talk about a story that is often told about jeff
mels/006853.pt|would you ever do an irl gym stream
mels/003677.pt|with and productivity growth it was
mels/007254.pt|was wondering why the whole thing didn't go
mels/003836.pt|good at marketing it because literally at the
mels/000227.pt|again we we have you know big ideas together this group and
mels/013440.pt|not because of star wars which she was
mels/027849.pt|yeah there's also entertainment from watching
mels/002449.pt|well provider but doesn't feel like switching because he's
mels/007357.pt|you'd always like switch off and like plop was like yeah i'll play sheik but when
mels/019097.pt|and technological solution to bridge that gap you can almost
mels/026545.pt|as a good feature for users how can we build
mels/009732.pt|it to i thought in my mind oh there's an object called nail polish remover just
mels/019100.pt|called the things that like if he was
mels/023893.pt|oh man dude it's such a branching point if you guys don't know zayn came into grand finals
mels/000239.pt|we're like yeah but if we roll bad it's just my brother going
mels/008868.pt|so they may agree to a lower deal and just try to move through it the problem is if twitter agrees to sell for less than
mels/006738.pt|well laughed at me because they're both pros
mels/018934.pt|because that's not the only reason this thing failed these guys clearly lacked foresight they clearly lacked any
mels/011312.pt|oh yeah it was still going
mels/026109.pt|at three cent raise they went on strike and
mels/015672.pt|so disney's safe that doesn't mean
mels/025938.pt|as of aspect of it that much so they're making
mels/025818.pt|is what i was talking about a hundred percent on
mels/029187.pt|the commencement of what became known as the start nine
mels/025551.pt|with the more they should just have the power they they have earned and be able to argue for things that
mels/009457.pt|influencer games are even worse than solo queue games not in terms of toxicity but in terms of
mels/016678.pt|you are in a growing industry something that's
mels/008231.pt|and he's sitting president has been able to win with the economy entering a recession i don't think that's ever happened incumbent advantage too strong no i
mels/023607.pt|it's so bad sick mental illness signs worse yeah the more i've heard about this and i'm not the expert by any means mostly it's so bad sick mental illness signs worsen yeah the more i've heard about this and
mels/018944.pt|mr chance the rapper mr the
mels/013267.pt|they say conor exposed al capone's tax
mels/001704.pt|this direction because i don't think i i have
mels/004339.pt|but you know the difference is i think it's even funnier
mels/008337.pt|i can't like let down but i did want to go to
mels/027132.pt|the sets interest rates it's hard to figure out what that means or what's going on interest rates are based so imagine this is the federal reserve it's just a big
mels/026444.pt|it's created key cultural moments around his emo now i think for example at the end
mels/025387.pt|at walmart i would get it and then i scrolled up and saw their 60 bucks
mels/004635.pt|he calls in and he's like
mels/015380.pt|above their weight class basically hbo
mels/018318.pt|and the founders and the employees make some money because they can sell their
mels/004940.pt|this announcement from elon came but as you
mels/026790.pt|i basically the high net worth high spend users they are all completely churned off of
mels/011938.pt|i you know resistant activity on this ship and we're
mels/014033.pt|are consistently dedicated audience large youtube channel what i think is most impressive about the foresight of youtube to pay extra to really secure a man who's who's been uh deep on twitch
mels/022560.pt|we found that's just not effective enough that's why we're excited to launch a brand new premium feature duolingo push
mels/015611.pt|earlier in this breakdown i referred to
mels/028719.pt|and i'm like hey i've written a lot of league articles
mels/000652.pt|down but my friends didn't know even though
mels/017602.pt|talking about okay the money has gone from here to here because as
mels/000299.pt|with the point is it's fantastic
mels/003454.pt|right now taiwan serves the entire globe
mels/003157.pt|it as entirely different flow and apple is
mels/017191.pt|my god dude i was i was really really upset
mels/011737.pt|they all have their name tags and i think they allowed them to choose what their home planet is because it
mels/024297.pt|and million dollars on this ad let's see what they got for it right off the bat it says you must be over 18 to views
mels/032147.pt|everybody i see stands i see
mels/002343.pt|i guess i mean i guess so i've always made that argument
mels/007927.pt|it was more than it feels more than like
mels/023041.pt|netscape was the biggest browser and microsoft said nah
mels/011462.pt|so long and if you at all interested in like banger
mels/014975.pt|big hollywood studio holding out everyone
mels/011356.pt|tech stocks that have gone for infinite growth and like we're
mels/000705.pt|but i wanted to go to asu but no
mels/020337.pt|him or relations whatever was necessary to be
mels/001332.pt|amber out of a makeshift banana if you can
mels/008777.pt|yeah there's just he's on very weak legal grounds
mels/031708.pt|there's no way i need to care about
mels/026236.pt|start to miss payments will cut you off so it's dead on training wheels you'll still have to pay
mels/014398.pt|probably one of the toughest these two are easier to copy this is very tough for them to crack they have to get the right people and really work at it and then finally
mels/021702.pt|i start to finish that would have been
mels/008880.pt|and it would probably be before the deal goes through
mels/013194.pt|in the next few minutes you guys
mels/005309.pt|do it because like you know i don't want i'm
mels/008242.pt|is going to be on the
mels/010374.pt|wiki the video i think so
mels/012935.pt|crushing every other part of marketing like traditional tv ads useless uh banner ads pretty useless
mels/031509.pt|perfect robot would do there is no optimal play
mels/012498.pt|if you want to be honest
mels/027859.pt|well of of a larger financial reckoning by the dip
mels/009301.pt|at a higher price would be good i think i think there's a couple
mels/016734.pt|as progress is made i mean i know that um
mels/012668.pt|aspect video popped up yeah i saw that
mels/020856.pt|of the thing i don't besides
mels/023987.pt|in the porn industry investing in a million different porn sites okay he's not like a prude this guy's not like oh we have to get the adult content
mels/009292.pt|it's like some percent of the population
mels/021465.pt|literally 50 plus billion dollars i mean
mels/031170.pt|the number one thing from the beginning was the record and i and
mels/020896.pt|so they were wrong you can find articles from 10 years ago
mels/010028.pt|it's the best one out of ten means it's it's number one out of your last 10 videos
mels/011354.pt|what of them on the subject no okay come on
mels/026607.pt|the reading the line don't mention
mels/032185.pt|what you get quadruple your money they give you three racks

mels/024799.pt|do of it you got free primo gems so
mels/023686.pt|and then quote okay next one okay well i'm just
mels/002798.pt|if the fix this problem but i haven't installed
mels/024219.pt|just to make not even to place on tv
mels/014779.pt|it'll it'll pop up everything you spend money on and you can swipe it to personal or business which makes it much much much easier
mels/017504.pt|wanted to include this song which is good i'll
mels/022741.pt|what the bigger let's go 12 and a half
mels/006315.pt|and then he gave me some tips on how to format for youtube and like how content works there versus three it was just
mels/008424.pt|i was doing homework but this is far
mels/030744.pt|true or false true or false a truck will
mels/026201.pt|i that's what everyone tells me i had to
mels/021631.pt|people don't share my concern for their well-being now this one's interesting the doritos
mels/030499.pt|and then i say this is my line
mels/007170.pt|a lot of people jesus was
mels/007859.pt|you guys what's going on today but i also
mels/027683.pt|we do attract engineering talent to find some
mels/010964.pt|in seeing the movie is one thing but what you really want to do is try the
mels/029846.pt|into a meeting room and we'd
mels/021347.pt|okay it's the story of the day let me preface this by saying that i know for a fact that people are very emotionally driven when it comes to this thing so no matter what advice i give you you won't listen everyone's like
mels/001556.pt|three american presidents past or not present three past american presidents uh bush okay
mels/015542.pt|mass cultural consciousness ted last of season one was the best they had but
mels/003077.pt|when a good mood but in the past couple
mels/018663.pt|it still is i believe in history the
mels/004097.pt|how's your health i'm fine no i don't
mels/023411.pt|are you inspired me to do radiant
mels/023662.pt|half my earnings as far as taxes and i got back nothing so they've
mels/000089.pt|worry a lot a lot but it's my wedding you know
mels/024436.pt|this one's like the most basic one right
mels/030666.pt|i i literally have no idea how to pronounce it so they go to him
mels/021721.pt|this entire ad is about how the tax
mels/027893.pt|i just get cut of your revenue which is going to lead to innovation a recession allows
mels/027336.pt|it killed him he wasn't even hard and i died a couple of times just don't play the
mels/029611.pt|and zayn's almost like they did they
mels/003300.pt|well let me get kind of serious for
mels/013654.pt|we literally don't care who are you we don't care we close mixer
mels/027396.pt|if they nuked everything they've ever done and
mels/020767.pt|and i'm so excited that i won this award for the monday you know what it is what
mels/003415.pt|to taiwan by the united states about 200
mels/010406.pt|well the free market it's the opposite of the free market it's a
mels/004768.pt|it doesn't make a lot of sense
mels/025026.pt|okay now this is pretty common
mels/000160.pt|on a roof our first thing we
mels/000621.pt|we showed up it was so cool that nick
mels/029052.pt|and i'm like we're both breathing heavy
mels/005375.pt|i can't have one good interaction with a
mels/030242.pt|so one christmas i couldn't go home to my family because my family lived in germany and i went to college in arizona so i was like oh okay i'm
mels/015086.pt|in right it was a disastrous split
mels/013268.pt|acs records even in this bit no they don't
mels/008764.pt|like he was very aware of everything going in and there's not there's no evidence of like massive
mels/024171.pt|in the next like you don't know to not
mels/022081.pt|we have in the fridge bank account you don't
mels/031750.pt|you do not need to say
mels/019047.pt|we've found the right way to do it yet i don't think seraphine is a
mels/003855.pt|let him off the hook but this inflation
mels/015351.pt|was actually because they don't have the
mels/012815.pt|team of the country we won ivy law
mels/002253.pt|to surprise and delight me and i'm glad that your dad enjoyed some parts of it
mels/018128.pt|in computer of pepsi city went out of
mels/006727.pt|asked me to sign something for someone on her team i believe and i i did sign a hoodie which was cool i started so
mels/028802.pt|okay so i was like yeah i'm making
mels/016514.pt|one that's relevant to all of us here and that is it's not going to play is it
mels/008411.pt|and so i said fire title game bro i just typed that
mels/016852.pt|so many industries i can't even
mels/019403.pt|oh my god that felt good dude
mels/000982.pt|that's what the question implies and the
mels/011475.pt|yeah i think it's i think this happens to all a lot of people it's a very
mels/002610.pt|i will be cutting it off there you do not
mels/030487.pt|i don't propose after the drinks okay we're still talking when it's good
mels/002791.pt|the artist is not well known and this song got massive off of just this video randomly and then they put him in the music video but barely and if
mels/027431.pt|one of them got promoted to me that i
mels/014133.pt|and most importantly out of all this is twitch realized it so i got a quote
mels/016099.pt|your your smell you need man oil man
mels/029352.pt|i was doing um like league
mels/031537.pt|early on right right i think basically here okay and
mels/007496.pt|anyway he gets that and it's the end of
mels/023175.pt|i was eating cereal so i'll join him and
mels/024027.pt|so that they and then only show the
mels/027911.pt|they hold but at least we can think about one thing we can say one thing and be happy
mels/018783.pt|sony or microsoft you probably want to just get a
mels/010201.pt|or like aerosolized i don't know what the magic is
mels/000417.pt|what part of the casino so i'm running i'm literally running over to the table
mels/002981.pt|if they got every theater to
mels/025753.pt|really quickly but outside of that i can't really tell
mels/018805.pt|as you just remember you guys put it as a four it's fair but it's wrong
mels/009161.pt|at that time at three hours so if it's
mels/015464.pt|much money from the way things currently are that they have to cannibalize themselves to grow disney plus if they were to say like we're releasing frozen two and it's exclusive
mels/024066.pt|this is nine head by only fans and then like oh my god they completely don't get it porn is like so important to only fans how could they be so stupid oh one more thing my only fans launches next week and let me tell you it is
mels/018963.pt|for some fundamentally stupid reason made the
mels/024562.pt|without using the ios app store at all apple would be within their legal rights
mels/017447.pt|when i was there and i did it freshman year and then i got into the league of
mels/017315.pt|ways from walmart in the early 2000s
mels/002325.pt|the let's go watch somebody else who we're
mels/004746.pt|at the time i owned 800
mels/020488.pt|are game they've made the witcher battle
mels/027804.pt|it worked because it was a it was a
mels/019316.pt|his name this kid was the biggest business school stoner
mels/003790.pt|john truby the story anatomy of a story by john
mels/029836.pt|it's a really wrong because he pulls out some
mels/023313.pt|with a massive fall today but i i took a screenshot that i really really liked that really just made me think of someone
mels/027586.pt|if you understand so much so far it's that
mels/020690.pt|because the way it came out just sort of
mels/013208.pt|don't think about you know like
mels/004508.pt|where the hope it's a great one hope it's a special one hope all your
mels/012042.pt|or potential and it's like me and like a
mels/010365.pt|it's not there isn't there it's all in the
mels/007226.pt|i forgot one part flashback the previous
mels/014435.pt|clumps of craters bouncing off each other yeah exactly that's why they're grabbing groups reddit killed digg yeah but
mels/023284.pt|let's start with wins and fails we always open every marketing monday session with some marketing wins and fails from the past
mels/021490.pt|if i'm borrowing the shares from you and i'm going to sell
mels/015616.pt|i'm talking of course about the mighty peacock
mels/027106.pt|you know is facebook going up bro
mels/005087.pt|let me see what i pulled up i bought in some
mels/029430.pt|he wanted to help me out and he was like yo well tell you what
mels/021873.pt|when your wife with and i thought well we should
mels/024256.pt|you know you take the red key yeah can
mels/007834.pt|was lost but you should drop a
mels/009934.pt|to the chat though it won't matter because you
mels/008021.pt|the wild but like the combat of of i guess
mels/024477.pt|well imprint upon your brain and so i'm
mels/028049.pt|then to do anything illegal even and
mels/030146.pt|i haven't learned my lesson at all i think is what i'm trying to say
mels/013510.pt|perfect balance in the middle i am literally
mels/018179.pt|for every person you your age that watches tv
mels/000457.pt|i passed the buzz line i'm drunk now it's
mels/029209.pt|where's tournaments but they won't sub
mels/016316.pt|jeff bezos is trying to get in the goat discussion
mels/009341.pt|is actually one of the best hosts
mels/008753.pt|and they want to make money we want to sell our
mels/010170.pt|so rapid that they just like
mels/031448.pt|this is just a plastic football it's like it's like a nerf ball stance gets back out bro and
mels/017477.pt|there i think they're raising a strike fund
mels/005666.pt|it was fun to be invited i had
mels/020008.pt|i think about yeah again i i wanted to include more scale examples because it's hard to think like 30 billion
mels/007486.pt|he pointed to it can i have the original joe but he pointed to the burger and
mels/013908.pt|and it was tough to get the full audio experience you know and for sound so we hooked that up to
mels/008962.pt|yeah but you can read the agreement i would check it out uh they there is the the
mels/009184.pt|i know why but it's like just those the way the numbers are displayed it's like i want that green dude
mels/016575.pt|getting more and more valuable this is
mels/005767.pt|i think he knows what he's doing i think
mels/021571.pt|some on black that way either way i'm fine that i'm just trying to keep it as simple as possible how did they sell stock they didn't have it's it's it's some financial tomfoolery
mels/008959.pt|from no matter what i think he just made a really dumb buy i think
mels/024883.pt|the method a lot by making you think you've earned something and saying you could only
mels/008220.pt|is that are doing absolutely terrible things so but the problem is just gas prices are high and the economy is doing poorly and this hot potato game that both parties
mels/018907.pt|would be all over this largely because of their attention span let me talk to you about these two people can i show if you were thinking who's the right
mels/032290.pt|you have to come back harder on monday
mels/013771.pt|i yeah i was i was i was uh

mels/026220.pt|it is actually worse and more expensive than credit cards and everyone you look at the reasons people

mels/024734.pt|video games but first i want to start by having you watch a very short video that maybe illustrates the point i'm trying to make here about
mels/004043.pt|i was basically trying to like take my mind off not feeling so well i wasn't i don't think i was sick straight up
mels/017888.pt|they ignore it they they're they're not impacted by it and you can't get the broad scale you need

mels/011530.pt|have you seen ludwig's youtube banner
mels/001235.pt|i don't think necessarily that a good
mels/016959.pt|at the fractional shares and the oh also
mels/024575.pt|little bit of leeway with apple they got the new button the reason epic games

mels/012004.pt|which i think i have a video let me see if i have a video i tried to sneak it but like when they're in there it feels weird
mels/002939.pt|you know how like you kind of want to give your characters time for the audience to like them and relate them
mels/026153.pt|or tesla to make a statue of elon musk it doesn't even look like him
mels/024044.pt|and they were like rejuvenating their
mels/026285.pt|after you've bought it and this could be
mels/002022.pt|we're making a big point yeah that's what i said yes we are in agreement
mels/022894.pt|which powerpoints explaining their arguments and i went through all of them it turns out
mels/000867.pt|i would need you guys to do one thing for me which is to ah i can't sing my voice is gone
mels/003019.pt|have an entirely the cops had heard reports of a gunshot in a
mels/012908.pt|this is before blizzard's total meltdown
mels/031564.pt|tactic failed and now he's in kill mode now he turns it on
mels/001506.pt|well for me than what i was doing before which
mels/010983.pt|in their new partnership with minions so
mels/030925.pt|it's wall and they have silhouettes of every champion so like a silhouette of pantheon
mels/022113.pt|the prime example of that is sunny d tweeting i can't do this anymore
mels/022162.pt|and people really felt a connection to it it wasn't too obtrusive about using their products and uh it's
mels/030521.pt|because i've been dating her for
mels/008471.pt|oh marketing monday oh yeah it was fun
mels/030762.pt|we just call was from someone higher up in the chain dude

mels/024458.pt|come on board and the idea of the ad campaign is called there's so much to say we
mels/030573.pt|nearly a year of the greatest stream
mels/013118.pt|and it said if you wake up early every day and and work out your life will change
mels/010470.pt|big a youtube frog here first time

mels/028741.pt|so i get there i i bring my friend lorenzo who's one of my oldest friends
mels/002037.pt|what in relation to what are you talking about when you say

mels/029951.pt|no no no no no no no no no no no no no i'm serious
mels/016012.pt|it'll give you the money that's basically the deal that's basically the deal and so if you are saying let's take on
mels/001859.pt|to get a date that we
mels/029828.pt|in your head you kid in college
mels/015721.pt|one time you know i think that's there's a good
mels/001824.pt|in psychopath murderer sorry that for that ruins
mels/029359.pt|as like oh yeah this place is great i mean it's it's nice and let me tell you it was nice but it was
mels/028104.pt|it's really it's uh it's a no-win situation
mels/025572.pt|to waste time the biggest wins and fails this week came from one company formerly known as facebook first i'm
mels/004432.pt|that is the coolest so i
mels/000933.pt|two months you have seven messages four of
mels/011841.pt|in good like it looks well
mels/018292.pt|i wanted to be that guy
mels/031389.pt|or through power through the drinking
mels/015318.pt|in your toothbrush sale business and your book
mels/025364.pt|why you but in my mind i'm sort of like bro
mels/013270.pt|the line up no i don't think he did do that if you haven't seen invincible you need
mels/012074.pt|in character like i can't believe these resistance you know i don't know it was
mels/012087.pt|as group lunches and dinners and there's a group like meetings with the
mels/023460.pt|they'd have a bigger margin they don't because they want a bigger
mels/026955.pt|that people are actually having i'm gonna
mels/019373.pt|well those kids woke up to check the status of their laptops and it was like
mels/009015.pt|and so she is not here tonight so i'm kind of open
mels/027219.pt|with regards to the map and
mels/028304.pt|that the question and eventually like
mels/001100.pt|is number one the weather's always hot so people are outside a lot and then number
mels/010681.pt|there isn't a boss wait is that is that going to be a thing am i going to go to play a
mels/022190.pt|this appears to be one of them
mels/026747.pt|more question people asked a lot because
mels/017456.pt|why at night but the striking
mels/022845.pt|and both companies have been worse ever since that's the end of the story except for one thing but this guy scott ahrens said together
mels/002875.pt|of options but they also move very quickly situations like this
mels/008208.pt|am considering going to some of the protests this weekend
mels/018845.pt|as voted this a 1 but a lot of you voted
mels/001938.pt|no the balance is really fun you know what i'm saying i like i like the balance i think the
mels/001353.pt|ask for any objections and then someone hops
mels/029860.pt|and scarves in the pieces this is you could ask any fossil
mels/025637.pt|well it's student loans got married and bought a house in
mels/027059.pt|it yeah it's just really pretentious but i think this ad being for crypto just
mels/003343.pt|like depressing one okay but it's it's it i just i
mels/005516.pt|about like political stuff really i'm
mels/000560.pt|we're all doing great and on sunday we have these new watches
mels/021367.pt|a short is essentially a bet that a stock will go down okay so essentially let's say ludwig stock is at
mels/002942.pt|like the movie did like an hour and a half of explosions and shooting and then
mels/024769.pt|in the payment information the friction for everything else that they're going to try
mels/021760.pt|as a local access show we want everyone to support local restaurants but we'd never manipulate you the way all these other commercials do
mels/007085.pt|what he wants to take it and i made
mels/006548.pt|it's a win for about five minutes when they
mels/011970.pt|it's like do good things and then there's the first order who
mels/026586.pt|is it come across better this is my one piece with free advice for all streamers if
mels/025287.pt|i don't watch it even though i already know the story because i played the
mels/015249.pt|around here and what you'll see it's almost every streaming service outside of netflix has these big churn spikes once their talk show ends they might around here and what you'll see is almost every streaming service outside of netflix has
mels/000455.pt|you know like when you're at the end of the night and you're really drunk you know the next day is going to suck and
mels/007017.pt|i have there and he came back later and gave me some sour candy so
mels/017359.pt|but kids are gonna need tech education because alexa this is real
mels/026169.pt|i yeah i was i was i was uh
mels/011972.pt|three groups and they have you have like loyalty points it doesn't really show your
mels/028981.pt|for three days i went back to the military base the truck was so hard and i got my debit card and i about
mels/031102.pt|and so what i told stands i remember
mels/011689.pt|well that makes fun of it i'm not gonna
mels/016754.pt|you old people which we barely have right now because millennials are a massive generation
mels/000680.pt|in japan she studied abroad there um
mels/007539.pt|eating my big crispy burger nice
mels/020860.pt|i stream the degree helps the degree helps and i
mels/022519.pt|in better returns i literally would be like okay
mels/001888.pt|waiting for youtube and they got to do all sorts
mels/024955.pt|understandable have a nice day so i want you to pour one out for these fallen soldiers and remember that we are all human beings and and our moments of weakness are very
mels/020059.pt|you're telling me you wouldn't pay
mels/028115.pt|the announced the following they were going public at a 1 billion dollar valuation
mels/012355.pt|it's the ship lands on batu
mels/006592.pt|media posts that he doesn't understand come on one more time bring it back it'll work for sure scout's honor
mels/023401.pt|three years late thoughts on costco keeping the price of
mels/029500.pt|you know what i would love to see
mels/031241.pt|did not have free wi-fi the hotel did
mels/003877.pt|i keep seeing articles that trump is
mels/030741.pt|it's a factory farm what is
mels/004115.pt|but the point is that she messaged me it was like in her first day
mels/001397.pt|that is huge there's a lot of
mels/031767.pt|is there will be a viewing party if you guys are able to artificially intelligently generate an entire anime series
mels/004189.pt|i don't know if you guys are just busy that day or what but it really it kind of felt weird i was hoping you would rsvp so that i could
mels/010468.pt|but now they're not it's not cool like
mels/027979.pt|i actually didn't hear that is that true
mels/015049.pt|so they realized okay our business doesn't make sense for the long term
mels/027116.pt|i was rapidly worthless so let's take a
mels/017365.pt|it's the error as soon as the company became
mels/004802.pt|the call it off and pay the billions
mels/006714.pt|the stream and then on twitter someone was asking
mels/012125.pt|we would like tell each other both sides of what was going on it was it was
mels/019896.pt|on your mom's ipad is not good this game is not good and it certainly is not living up to what they promised it's
mels/003404.pt|what's going on in china was that beijing and the main
mels/008250.pt|and talk about his time he's one of the earliest
mels/017028.pt|what marketing and then you want
mels/022220.pt|through the land of our childhood
mels/015356.pt|and of the year comes and a gigantic tax bill is owed and if you don't have anything saved you're kind of screwed this
mels/030339.pt|it's a real nato badge like from my dad was flying in nato
mels/017389.pt|i just wanted to mention it uh you know
mels/027743.pt|virtual reality and is a part of
mels/028937.pt|is out he then started regaling
mels/003598.pt|do you recommend electrocute or first strike on
mels/020331.pt|would probably give it a maybe a two maybe
mels/008648.pt|with twitter in some way and make elon
mels/013279.pt|i would i would watch that
mels/009061.pt|hold up hold up hold on
mels/023248.pt|i stick to my tried and true chipotle
mels/002963.pt|everybody's talking about the gray man
mels/013699.pt|there's a market here you could make money stop doing it so badly bloors line is open
mels/015272.pt|they have a large library size that's bigger than almost everyone
mels/009844.pt|living in seoul you did not need a car one bit and it was not inconvenient at all legitimately a car would be more inconvenient getting around
mels/008890.pt|world's richest man having 10 kids having three
mels/016860.pt|in the world and it's going to make a major
mels/005249.pt|if the that were just which is which is fine we're just
mels/021975.pt|be clever now jeff bezos likes doing hard things i don't think he ever decided to do that the last thing i have here is his piece
mels/004323.pt|elon musk obama lebron james or steve carell
mels/006585.pt|you know solid pick that they were going to make
mels/010361.pt|reacting to tick tocks so we've got a full
mels/009629.pt|at tournaments back when i would go to tournaments
mels/020370.pt|sister this is the one time where i
mels/016995.pt|your marketing monday on it so if you don't want to read
mels/028296.pt|how come the toilet paper in the thing
mels/025179.pt|while your chips taste so i added a tagline too for you the
mels/019624.pt|what part of the schedule sort of popped up the auto zone jingle welcome
mels/027500.pt|the immediate upside is good for me let's look at what happened this is twitter stock elon musk
mels/003569.pt|i i i don't think i'm a dumb optimist but i think
mels/025786.pt|and ready to launch they would put on
mels/010707.pt|if you have to include that hundred thousand dollars extra you get as a bonus from mr beast every year
mels/005572.pt|the actual payment but he did uh
mels/018988.pt|in quicker and faster and cheaper uh
mels/031372.pt|in my but apparently i have been misled at some point because he has rented an
mels/017323.pt|it's many people this quickly if they keep up this growth they'll be the world's largest
mels/024961.pt|monday but basically i have a map that we're
mels/022166.pt|that i find a little more distasteful is an ad i saw from subaru if you guys know what it is or maybe you can find it basically it's about a child getting into a car crash and the mom
mels/011552.pt|with reason and with logic okay and maybe you
mels/013354.pt|you can't talk like that to people
mels/026746.pt|that being said could they do another one after this no and that
mels/030993.pt|it's kind of way not in
mels/002421.pt|it literally never arrived and in fact i never even received the confirmation
mels/032291.pt|the guys if at all today you hear that my
mels/008798.pt|and thus yes yes they could um but again the way the financing
mels/016705.pt|come up with solutions to this or think about these problems are going to be extremely valuable over the next 20 years
mels/008243.pt|he is the person that hired me at
mels/015807.pt|it'd be a long time before they
mels/011542.pt|did you see the tweet that was like grey's anatomy is white women's one piece
mels/029027.pt|and bigger than me and we were friends but we both liked the same girl and we both were kind of arguing
mels/002222.pt|that's a classic ben sw if you guys
mels/012351.pt|i tried blue milk yeah i tried blue milk and green milk i tried everything
mels/024892.pt|the the finish leveled up so you have to finish the level though so
mels/003785.pt|when everything give him no wins and then
mels/006213.pt|what getting wednesday third ever working
mels/026118.pt|he's like apple companies like activision blizzard is having a strike right now they're i
mels/008657.pt|it's of throwing out the entire contract because at the end of the day the contract kind
mels/017430.pt|dude responses well some of the women
mels/026537.pt|time like if you jumped in early
mels/012096.pt|i was like yeah yeah i'm ready to go brother yeah
mels/011438.pt|as the joker laugh i used a regular ring but i went
mels/020741.pt|and that's why the worst ad of the year
mels/030247.pt|the folly of youth i just sat on that
mels/026619.pt|so i made a tweet today that i would like to share with you just a casual
mels/032055.pt|that was just an inside joke for
mels/021290.pt|if you guys are watching me right now
mels/024870.pt|ways they do that let me let me show you one of the psychological principles they
mels/013530.pt|she would wax me in brawl yeah she was she she would wax me
mels/025176.pt|and i don't want my mom to look at it so i softened your
mels/031368.pt|overarching theme is that i am a
mels/016758.pt|it's absolutely insane to me that people think that closing off immigration will benefit the country we're in at all
mels/022314.pt|adds that have stuck with me and i think about them when i'm at work number five taco bell's blackout campaign in
mels/026927.pt|in pretty solvent being dead honest with
mels/011567.pt|and that's cool that's fine that's
mels/032233.pt|it's like it's like in slow motion i watched him walk to the atm pull out literally
mels/028354.pt|oh my god dude just screaming and
mels/010904.pt|with the quickly is that is that i am
mels/007053.pt|i also i knew a guy i knew a guy when i worked at twitch
mels/027722.pt|if the yearly salary of the CEO of Coca-Cola
mels/009367.pt|is that my understanding he's doing a lot of
mels/006488.pt|and the data is not looking good okay
mels/012645.pt|and maybe get smarter i told factor i would do it on thursday and
mels/030699.pt|he was up there in second place
mels/031035.pt|was the deep because when we were moving out we
mels/024222.pt|we didn't know how much they cost now we know how much they cost
mels/003080.pt|i don't think they've gotten extra dark i think that the world is just crashing now economically
mels/023191.pt|okay so you can make it up the first
mels/001964.pt|waffle maker did i have a stroke or is that what you said
mels/017269.pt|public domain you can make this cool matrix poo you can draw weird poo rule
mels/012129.pt|like that it was i've never tried anything like it it's kind of like sleep no more which i really want to
mels/002920.pt|it was any numbers and whatever they say they're very secretive about it
mels/007190.pt|watch like all the best sheiks i would watch all their vods on the flights
mels/027805.pt|instead of tapering it off they actually kept going and increased it
mels/022332.pt|years later when developing a campaign for nvidia i took the ideas that i liked about it
mels/021062.pt|the pants over and over for an easy joke that's funny to me
mels/013567.pt|would suggest buy the sigma tank walk
mels/015644.pt|gotten so far that's not big enough to win a
mels/023579.pt|they were they were losing so much money on
mels/007960.pt|the some graphs and charts thank you to my new
mels/026122.pt|we're back into the hands of the employees okay that was my last win i think it's time
mels/020304.pt|this is my recommended we landed on a solid
mels/023973.pt|it's got fitness stuff it's got cooking stuff it's got comedy stuff and most importantly it's got no users
mels/004791.pt|your and then contract law as bain saying do you feel in charge because the reaction from twitter's board has been pretty swift the twitter board
mels/007245.pt|i absolutely don't absolutely do not worry
mels/009257.pt|if the two months macintosh think of the 11.
mels/003176.pt|for like the past five or six years
mels/023963.pt|walk a little bit about what's
mels/016450.pt|it will force people back into the workforce it it's disgusting
mels/022038.pt|i my general thought is that this is
mels/018414.pt|otherwise you might die you may cringe right out of your chair into
mels/008410.pt|i used to have the best titles in the business and then coney came along
mels/017623.pt|at the prices they do so they created these um these stores
mels/019035.pt|is there was two reactions to this that
mels/011037.pt|tell me about it tell me about it
mels/007743.pt|until they were forced to cover your bill
mels/026696.pt|but out of nowhere he gets it
mels/005015.pt|at the personally inspect every twitter account for a bot and he was just too busy
mels/017750.pt|from their own consumers it is a proven phenomenon where car companies will run ads not even to attract new buyers but to make buyers that spent money on their car feel better about it so they're just stuck in this mindset and it's one of the most inexpensive
mels/022447.pt|well a little bit too much for it but uh yeah
mels/001070.pt|my editors to the bachelor party okay but not quack though
mels/019498.pt|a good point to make here is that
mels/018765.pt|if the considered higher end and bought by families with
mels/006430.pt|well rune chains and your prospects of a successful run and great loot have never been better all members
mels/003949.pt|which streamer would be the best president
mels/006010.pt|well but top 16 against jmuk and
mels/017231.pt|well for his genius marketing obviously but they didn't kill him
mels/018571.pt|out of the gate and so
mels/006020.pt|he's uh he's not like that so if he's
mels/024548.pt|isn't there there's even a debate
mels/000926.pt|in the world you want let me know what do you want i'll make it happen for you after a quick negotiation smoothly with the 10 months
mels/005294.pt|the pictures like a big ass line
mels/026510.pt|and they chose all in on hate
mels/026256.pt|print valuation of apple apple is phenomenally phenomenally outside successful these are all successful companies and they are nowhere close to what apple
mels/015687.pt|services to have any impact and then
mels/016420.pt|the stock they get to buy the real estate
mels/017346.pt|so technically when i'm making money right now on twitch i am making amazon money who dat works for amazon unfortunately why does
mels/027297.pt|if the is getting more and more micro news people
mels/008630.pt|get free money but you know what i'm saying let's if you have a bad business
mels/027676.pt|his plan by his logic i would have to pay 75
mels/000809.pt|so by the end of the night the the fat wallet is as thin as it was
mels/024036.pt|is going to be worse than just figuring out some kind of deal with the banks later on it was worded towards
mels/020334.pt|i am performance this is perfect for my chat because they all drive mercedes benzes a
mels/001676.pt|the dumbest russian voyage nobody talks about
mels/019164.pt|that would be kind of interesting or like if it showed for example I mean you
mels/014344.pt|more people nuclear bomb of youtube is that the size of youtube is so so so so much bigger the the max cap on what you can do on
mels/008842.pt|the problem is he's you know he's already
mels/017480.pt|and there's there's a rise in general labor movements and they're having success and i just want to say personally that i deeply support these and if you in your
mels/025232.pt|is china just banned kids from basically
mels/017622.pt|and the price tags of like a gucci they are the only company in human history to have that
mels/016895.pt|and uh and so people that are involved
mels/023441.pt|the education company that created this these concepts
mels/032203.pt|well this has been to build my confidence
mels/008265.pt|as esports moments of all time he's got some clips put together this is even
mels/016224.pt|i think you're actually you know what we should
mels/020455.pt|exactly what i was looking forward to it's what i wanted
mels/018483.pt|the most valuable companies in the world in a current ranking apple currently the most
mels/025012.pt|well i figured out what this
mels/020058.pt|youtube was its own company it
mels/011783.pt|be immersive and right now everything was kind of gray and dreary and i'm like oh
mels/030064.pt|at six years old probably the world's biggest pokemon fan i love pokemon i
mels/009410.pt|i say it i know i can't say it i'm not i won't say it i won't say it yeah
mels/031833.pt|the hype slash fortnite i get it we all get it people that vape people that had more sex than me okay i get it but
mels/005354.pt|golden blunt and probably made i mean i was i
mels/018638.pt|because amazon and and uh and google
mels/021203.pt|is there are looking for i think they're
mels/017270.pt|it's all it's all available or it's all available and it's all kosher because winnie the pooh is now public domain that being said it's actually not all available it's all it's all available okay it's all available and it's all kosher because
mels/028141.pt|so they spent about 80 million they made
mels/004569.pt|so now that you lost on twitter is it a tax
mels/016920.pt|oh if you're a student in university
mels/018720.pt|what do you have on their side they have the flex factor better games higher install base currently problem here is that microsoft
mels/003497.pt|it's dollars in a lot of time to build like
mels/004286.pt|i stream on nokia phones from 2003
mels/007823.pt|and to do marketing monday we
mels/026384.pt|tesla cyber truck okay it's a product that doesn't need to pay for
mels/013866.pt|the long game and trying to win the cloud uh so that was a win on predictions
mels/014865.pt|millennials are gonna have a real great next 10 years the next
mels/011071.pt|is going to be what we call an issue without a tissue how about if i do this bada bing
mels/026261.pt|if the the government but in general uh the reasons
mels/009568.pt|advantage i know she's good at league but i mean double again there's levels
mels/007846.pt|i was trying to practice some hitman
mels/003680.pt|harshly enforced estate taxes like the top tax rate was very high estate taxes were very strong
mels/013311.pt|i e relationship i don't follow up
mels/008644.pt|this is pretty solid and the delaware contracts
mels/000009.pt|it was like six of us and we were all walking into a casino
mels/018140.pt|if the pepsi game that is crazy i could not imagine nowadays trying to pitch this to a brand that's base
mels/025271.pt|the few months by getting everyone in the world to talk about it simultaneously okay i told myself no i'm just not
mels/018337.pt|and they have existed for i believe let me get this right 17 years
mels/016812.pt|at comments on youtube where i say remember this when no one had their phones
mels/010026.pt|it's that saved pride month which was an absolute banger that's cool love to see that
mels/023954.pt|and so they're copying things from america again and also brandless failed dramatically
mels/000533.pt|we we i i found these watches last time we were in vegas that were the four seasons
mels/005769.pt|because that was okay here's the deal
mels/015492.pt|but it's but that's that's kind of a interesting
mels/010767.pt|if you know what i'm saying
mels/022879.pt|was full of children screaming basically over discord they played travis scott tunes advertised their youtube channel
mels/026570.pt|i am threatening you in case
mels/022346.pt|i know he just turned their channels off
mels/002385.pt|with the first time really since the game came out
mels/009576.pt|i have played for 10 years
mels/003308.pt|it's not the official definition or the way
mels/014589.pt|well let's say nobody did they can still every year say that youtube gaming is
mels/019828.pt|of no man's sky it's really long so we can't watch
mels/016610.pt|actually have a video on it
mels/007386.pt|if the for a minute and loved hbox listen i
mels/024711.pt|or stocks right now and what i'm noticing is if you compare it to this chart this is when they did all the buying no ethics outcry
mels/002578.pt|we're gonna roll a dice i
mels/000770.pt|again as an idea while drunk i'm just telling you the
mels/001669.pt|there's one called formula one explained for rookies i don't
mels/015079.pt|the dvd rental business of netflix was spun off into a separate company called
mels/011641.pt|because she loves animals and gators and
mels/002830.pt|it's a state of being in limbo and
mels/006608.pt|i ended the day it's like 12 coffee count memes
mels/001174.pt|and it's very quick and there's no
mels/012165.pt|or stuff so i got some of that and i got to be able to enter into a
mels/018629.pt|was mixer flopping they really planned on mixer doing better so they could have they could own the
mels/027050.pt|i don't think this did what they wanted which
mels/006705.pt|it's not a problem but it was a problem because
mels/019336.pt|we contentious for reasons you will soon see people were not clapping at the end of our presentation and i will show you why every
mels/021866.pt|this one opening in chess if you give
mels/006348.pt|so let's jump right into it today we'll start with the wins and fails of the
mels/005403.pt|are doing it but i don't want to put any work
mels/029119.pt|time to start because that was by far the biggest stream that twitch had ever seen
mels/030884.pt|myself this morning maybe no i think actually you know what
mels/015850.pt|we had a good run we had a good run
mels/006259.pt|have you seen the hassan reaction to your video which video
mels/016846.pt|it's going to lead to all sorts of things
mels/015782.pt|doing research for this i found
mels/015731.pt|what what everyone is starting to run into is that people just sign up for a service watch exactly one show during a free trial and then quit that i
mels/031692.pt|soldier soldier soldier king three soldiers one king
mels/024313.pt|this is the motor city this is what we do
mels/009865.pt|and dense building in cities is really cool
mels/018019.pt|to rando guy i forget his name he was really
mels/009266.pt|it was like that kind of you know i was like a little too
mels/020573.pt|working bleary-eyed looking at the same monitor little do you know how
mels/012463.pt|meet including the kids like oh my god it's
mels/000130.pt|while let me tell you what happened at the bachelor party it was very fun
mels/008045.pt|what how does he do it and that was the humor and it was that over and over again for the entire game every combat of which there's thousands that was that was literally it and then i'm sorry wait the
mels/000666.pt|filled with i mean talking about racks we just had a ton of money in that fanny pack and it was filled with the brim with
mels/023991.pt|on thursday there's been some outside investors get reported so investors are
mels/000018.pt|with stealthy by the way like anyone it was
mels/012045.pt|close our eyes and do it again but this
mels/029301.pt|we don't have any open internships but i'm
mels/020014.pt|what if they just bought the whole internet
mels/000459.pt|well i'm not kidding it must have been a a busy weekend in
mels/017758.pt|a twitch based example today i want to bring up somebody i think we all
mels/019724.pt|we changed they have not it's not like it's the iphone versus the a giant
mels/002379.pt|i might make a small bet in that direction paranoid
mels/031312.pt|the crime as i would soon find out i'm walking out the store
mels/030596.pt|it's selling importing or spitting out chewing gum illegal gotta be north korea
mels/010112.pt|i have a video on napoleon's masterful greatest battle at austerlitz basically the best battle of his whole career that i've always wanted to watch so i'm gonna watch that i want to see how napoleon sort of made his
mels/015791.pt|that's it those are not big players
mels/030233.pt|you can't hear the sound but they're they're hitting each other like it
mels/013658.pt|yes emotionally it impacts more people i
mels/032175.pt|chip in a chair gives me a
mels/007936.pt|chatter around like bones what do you
mels/023015.pt|they went around apple's review store of
mels/013066.pt|i love sour patch anyway it
mels/001535.pt|who painted a sunday afternoon on the island of
mels/009920.pt|bro the other day didn't you just
mels/024834.pt|there's constantly adding more to make sure that it's not the case another thing
mels/031820.pt|if they're inviting him to sit with him but he still sits away
mels/030428.pt|figure it out like a kgb spot yeah
mels/003318.pt|it's like at three percent it's very low unemployment's low which means workers
mels/025338.pt|i got four thousand retweets instead then
mels/014658.pt|i work in supply chain and i would love to know how marketing factors and issues other than business functions in other business functions
mels/016986.pt|the monday on it because i find it really
mels/030951.pt|it is i can show you a wonderful
mels/012986.pt|it's like designed to be as boring and monotonous as possible the way people learn in real life is they pick one thing they get into and they get obsessed with it it should be like like like you should have a history month if you're gonna do it like that way it should be
mels/028247.pt|if the think they're looking right into my soul like insanely into my soul and i was like whoa but that's a good thing
mels/026459.pt|almost business you interact with if you were to start a business you should think about how your customer interacts with you at all stages of the process in general
mels/008994.pt|it's like it's like when you
mels/020405.pt|at this elf what is what is this playful
mels/024561.pt|are saying like even if you went to the
mels/021604.pt|the hell is going on if you just count tom brady in his
mels/012944.pt|like six months after i chose to go to
mels/002695.pt|you certainly are brave and bold for never walking away from a game that prints you free money with no downside a hero just like john baptiste
mels/025848.pt|bad result secondly and this is a major one how both companies have responded to the rise of influencers in the past let's
mels/020737.pt|rebrand was tone deaf almost every brand
mels/025243.pt|the amount of viewership on twitch would
mels/032182.pt|hung out saturday on saturday bro we were rolling every single one of us was making racks on
mels/025208.pt|one worldwide for like the entire day but it was all negative they're already getting milked for cash at every possible
mels/001944.pt|would you be happy going all in on streaming no i i
mels/004942.pt|this company is going to crater unless they can they can prove that they can hold
mels/001891.pt|what are you mean do about it
mels/013316.pt|which makes me think i shouldn't trust
mels/023429.pt|you know what i'm saying and energy is usually a function of like health like if you're healthy you get
mels/014021.pt|how many bundles left but yes if
mels/009141.pt|if the three months of elon musk
mels/028286.pt|which is where you can see chad on vods
mels/005273.pt|the to make a big deal out of it and
mels/006943.pt|is your birthday messages and i see them and i appreciate them i really do you know it's hard turning
mels/023340.pt|and he's a celebrity among them and that's worth it turns out a staggering amount of money in an age where
mels/002234.pt|you know it's just like he would have
mels/027556.pt|the poison pill is a rule emergency backup plan that
mels/012631.pt|so we don't have it on video but like at one point they go you know do
mels/021928.pt|find this wheel to get it started but once it
mels/001393.pt|we didn't from the server i didn't want to do that i didn't want to do that wasn't a good one chad that wasn't a good one he said
mels/001958.pt|pretty happy overall it's all good i just wish i had a little more time
mels/012445.pt|with me out when i'm a big shot i'm
mels/027841.pt|get it back and burns the money every quarter
mels/006603.pt|i saw it through eddie burback's video
mels/021555.pt|right now if you're thinking oh man this was great
mels/002361.pt|what i'll get you the steak and
mels/000327.pt|i think lud stands and two of my high school friends i think that is the squad
mels/017527.pt|way of viewing marketing and basically the point of today's mini marketing monday
mels/016212.pt|you don't have to update me i know this is marketing monday i know
mels/009818.pt|the worst part is they announced like months ago they were shutting down and stopping
mels/029374.pt|elon musk they start talking about elon musk and all the things he's doing and elon musk in
mels/013271.pt|we need to watch it i have not seen it nope nope
mels/011703.pt|the drive into the staff entrance so like there's a big staff parking lot that's like a million miles wide behind
mels/021090.pt|if you're worried that i'm being biased right now just know that if you love this ad i am
mels/021852.pt|the thing that sort of explains then
mels/022122.pt|mood last night all good mp thanks for checking in
mels/025023.pt|it because it's probably also you
mels/006514.pt|we can actually afford whenever you can split
mels/025880.pt|all the resentment that's been building
mels/004882.pt|certain that it's an absolutely fair breakdown but it does seem from all that i'm seeing through the past few months is that he he continues to
mels/015503.pt|the they're like flat even and it'll be interesting to see which one shoots up
mels/018349.pt|if you know you're not going to get stuck
mels/005931.pt|elaborate yes now i got a couple
mels/012296.pt|when he wins one hand she punts everything to him i mean she goes all in with like a
mels/022636.pt|i got a question how are the
mels/030189.pt|that's the important thing if somebody doesn't want you to
mels/001056.pt|diggity damn hey man i know your wedding is coming up but i think our three year anniversary next month might be a little bit of a big deal i hope you're thinking of our three year anniversary gift mine is really cool to you so
mels/024404.pt|this fail is on every other gaming developer because the gauntlet has been thrown
mels/030676.pt|some ice cream because my dad barely even knew there
mels/005925.pt|it's a little bit wants to get that option back on the table he's worried about just misfacing lasers even so slightly
mels/022239.pt|an ipad i get it the parents don't care it's for all of you
mels/030463.pt|i got a full body tattoo right so on the front it said will you and on the back it was supposed to say this is embarrassing it was supposed to say marry me but it said
mels/023610.pt|salary on top of bonuses out of her
mels/018976.pt|their competition was this this and this was so much better than anything quibby had ever thought of ever
mels/012613.pt|but i think they have potential there
mels/021901.pt|works negatively and positively is if i work out during the day if i
mels/008168.pt|can you even watch the boys on stream you absolutely can thank god for amazon prime watch parties this week is indeed for the gamers
mels/011455.pt|no i'm not you listen i
mels/030680.pt|and then my dad's like not well not like like really bad
mels/019616.pt|which by the way we have a special
mels/002628.pt|misinterpreted the signals let's find out if you truly have the foresight the wisdom this needs to be tails again
mels/015944.pt|that works well is hard and that's why
mels/030376.pt|this is like this never happens but what if they check my bag and they pull out the
mels/007400.pt|but it was it was it was rowdy in there it was packed and it was rowdy
mels/010743.pt|there's going to be an actual fire here and i'm going to roast the live and this clip is going to be so ominous
mels/029416.pt|and i remember so i got one guy's business card from riot uh and i after that day i was like
mels/010927.pt|we get 16 free meals from hellofresh
mels/031297.pt|and that hubris that hubris comes back
mels/020122.pt|finding their foothold in social media
mels/009065.pt|hold up oh man there's some really good music playing right now jammies jammies jammies the music is
mels/026235.pt|and it's a big problem and so i just want to make sure that this branding does not fool you these things are essentially debt on training wheels credit cards they will give you as much money as possible and lock you into
mels/004629.pt|and buys the yacht you know what i'm saying this
mels/030035.pt|nothing makes you feel like a
mels/030852.pt|that's one thing so let me let me just role
mels/024386.pt|they didn't want to film in new york
mels/007967.pt|on a sunday i have to make a bunch of charts and that's that's like it's like homework that's a lot of work and i was like you know what if these videos make money i can
mels/028468.pt|this kid does not look to the left he turns to the right he sees my dad my dad tries to be
mels/019746.pt|i have eminem like really accurately sounds super like him and it can stay on a beat
mels/018176.pt|want to make a chat joke i am 50 years older than the oldest one
mels/026130.pt|because it spiked it's the only
mels/032310.pt|the whole thing was planned ahead of time i had been grinding
mels/017845.pt|go for example or at least making inroads because
mels/005594.pt|i heard a lot of them went to waste like 20 plus
mels/028170.pt|a year more than there's three times more
mels/030790.pt|what did you mean when you said she blown my dick like a cello
mels/026400.pt|the thinking about this type of this this
mels/002650.pt|love marketing monday smiley face it looks like this if you
mels/028521.pt|get on a payment plan or you're gonna
mels/009135.pt|i literally said that and then
mels/022764.pt|and it would have been a better use of money
mels/007414.pt|add a great time i feel like it's hard to have a bad time although i will say if you are uncomfortable i think you should go with some friends if you are like a friend you should go you can go completely alone but it's hard it's
mels/024195.pt|we just playing the wait and see because twitch
mels/017347.pt|jeff bezos can bring me back to work over my cold dead body this is fake unless he invites me to whatever party he was at for this photo
mels/027933.pt|and financially because they don't have a
mels/026477.pt|we have to look at the wins and the
mels/012383.pt|and you're talking to them but if you've been really good
mels/032218.pt|with walk away and then we
mels/014168.pt|and then recently they hit on something okay this was a new development right around here when they brought over because they had courage for
mels/031447.pt|it's around on the rocks as he's grabbing the
mels/003729.pt|actually they were doing incredibly well and things like batteries and stuff like that and so it's like yeah the ftc is not have a great track
mels/009976.pt|when it comes to comedy songs i
mels/030121.pt|at all night trying to make it work i gotta
mels/018344.pt|is actually a pretty good topic for for
mels/030198.pt|him he said afterwards he made it over the top
mels/016783.pt|is the largest age court in america right now and uh by
mels/017189.pt|with the my body i couldn't get a full breath
mels/029386.pt|cause i didn't know who he was i honestly didn't know i was a esports addict and let me tell you when i asked that that was worse than apparently
mels/018865.pt|it's the thirstiest time of the year with claymation celebrities and
mels/032103.pt|i think he realizes that it has no ending and no point so he pulls the
mels/014933.pt|we're talking about billion dollar deals we're
mels/030842.pt|he specifically and can i perhaps leverage that into a job walk me through this finn actually
mels/006133.pt|but we need that you know we need a joker
mels/028089.pt|at the motorola guy who is an awful presenter anyway the whole time you could tell that steve jobs
mels/004093.pt|that's that's not part of the menu
mels/024902.pt|that yourself the way games use it is they will do

mels/017279.pt|ryan reynolds turn it immediately into an ad called winnie the screwed by mint mobile
mels/008381.pt|it's almost too good but i'm sure this one won't be
mels/018594.pt|it's released and that one might be the most likely
mels/014310.pt|number one twitch prime twitch prime is a great way a ton of free money for creators at
mels/015236.pt|in the for success and that shows up with this
mels/026075.pt|i had a fun stream with emmaroo where i

mels/000519.pt|we get a text to come to
mels/027285.pt|will make sense in a second
mels/025738.pt|knives out i'm like that was a pretty good commercial because it
mels/019802.pt|great big media franchise uh anyway

mels/022289.pt|kill streak unlock the nuke or whatever
mels/008705.pt|know what i'm saying and so
mels/031295.pt|i'm feeling like oh my god i'm
mels/031346.pt|obviously double down if i'm in for a
mels/013589.pt|now you know things have gone wrong
mels/013430.pt|you know what i should take it back i
mels/013604.pt|it's like leonard was carrying a huge
mels/020698.pt|i remember is how filthy disgusting this burger was why would you ever want to go to burger king after you see this
mels/011128.pt|or person while you're at it is that what you want to do airpods
mels/002565.pt|it's so much then i'm gonna
mels/005686.pt|i did not know because again going into this the only interaction
mels/024018.pt|go crazy and so only fans
mels/005298.pt|what should i couldn't i was like
mels/023077.pt|where everyone makes fun of on pcmr
mels/010560.pt|if you're literally asking me to do like heroin i would rat cutie if you came
mels/016887.pt|but he got double his viewership because
mels/029513.pt|tell it like if they just told these little side stories of people who wanted to be even one god and they struggled and it
mels/029883.pt|awesome i get to see everything that's happening
mels/006475.pt|it's they mentioned this article a mail carrier wrote it that
mels/013137.pt|and i was telling them how
mels/005524.pt|leave binds it must have been so hard
mels/022046.pt|for talking about brand fails around i would say
mels/012927.pt|was nothing you can get insane amount
mels/002017.pt|the the biggest boba hater and
mels/026571.pt|the backtracked i am threatening you i want you to know that i
mels/009201.pt|your friends that's such a rare example
mels/006459.pt|it's already been discussed to death in the world of gaming industry nobody no gaming publisher is going to
mels/017063.pt|as well as a youtube atlas both of which could be fun to explore both of which could be fun to explore i
mels/027565.pt|well and that elon must take over would
mels/027378.pt|they look the other way it helps them
mels/025272.pt|time on tire king after everyone's
mels/025459.pt|how dope is that graphic design kings and queens out there get on this you could work on dozens of projects and eventually maybe
mels/011786.pt|into a room that i guess either was an elevator or
mels/011078.pt|in the temp files or something it would not open kind of a you know
mels/012216.pt|it's like you roll a number and you have to get as close to that number as possible with
mels/012434.pt|well i'm playing with him i was already getting there within two days i grinded sabacc more than anyone else
mels/022142.pt|his tweet to eight million people thank god
mels/004725.pt|in your spare time come on
mels/004425.pt|with us to give his thoughts maybe um so
mels/028880.pt|throw up right here i feel terrible this is this is this is no good so they took the other 10 and they poured
mels/021876.pt|okay this is a real text that he sent this woman this you might think it's photoshop this
mels/031849.pt|the king of the league community
mels/002767.pt|with the prime your local cat made think of the prime austin david
mels/002047.pt|hello so i'm single and a friend of mine suggested that i try dating apps so i've been on
mels/012848.pt|i get my whole life was league of
mels/023098.pt|the other companies that have uh done some little tricky
mels/030740.pt|bit of course it's the number one
mels/003898.pt|so it's like imagine if either one of them doesn't really matter
mels/001280.pt|when i watched him he would be like hey eat this bowl penis for fifty thousand
mels/026266.pt|and the most valuable brand in the world so how did they get their brand to be worth so much more than everyone else's including other big tech companies that have
mels/028556.pt|if the taxes or did you sell any
mels/009764.pt|it's not basically just the parent trap in no way is what i described similar to the plot of the lindsay lohan vehicle the parent trap at no point does she remove her face surgically right right you guys get that though right you
mels/012003.pt|are so committed that it does make it kind of
mels/019082.pt|wash it a step further than we
mels/023798.pt|because these are really funny and
mels/030096.pt|if i don't get how you pikachu tonight
mels/025406.pt|it's called real magic it's about a minute long and it's been called by some to be one of the worst ads of all time the
mels/016374.pt|at for blank it's all automated
mels/027085.pt|simple as possible but i also understand that we need to open with a round of
mels/016108.pt|do fingers you think the lesson is always have a marketing name and uh don't doubt something just
mels/023225.pt|and i'm also very aware that i'm getting
mels/012198.pt|and comes down to the basement sits down helps me out
mels/022274.pt|cause i died from an accident
mels/016164.pt|second to last because then no one cares
mels/018880.pt|if the target market his children would be
mels/027258.pt|they are choosing to avoid making the money because the brand gain is probably worth it for them in the long run over the
mels/016640.pt|if you're in a low cost location like say arizona they're already cheaper than currently built fossil power plants by
mels/011435.pt|i'm actually going to stream this week
mels/005519.pt|it was all just dumb family jokes but the problem is i'm just not drunk and everyone was drunk and
mels/005443.pt|in bright white smile and this dude's like
mels/021359.pt|i really feel that safe in it
mels/001545.pt|but i'm going to shake sapphire shake sapphire
mels/000828.pt|if you're not you should be i mean dermis the
mels/007755.pt|that i was the fastest man alive that could smoke usain bolt
mels/019930.pt|give us everything we wanted and it
mels/030693.pt|for a girl or fifth grade girl maybe comes up
mels/021617.pt|so if you're in pretty solid or above you probably got your money's worth given how many people saw it but if you're below that's where it gets risky so we're going to start off with a really interesting ad the
mels/010177.pt|as i don't think i can do that without getting banned but that would be very
mels/021104.pt|i like the most about it
mels/007132.pt|get them out it was crazy it was crazy
mels/011375.pt|it's simple message you don't gotta say oh
mels/005193.pt|the new name formerly known as jesse mccree
mels/016979.pt|okay i do love those keys
mels/011009.pt|let me open up balloons and see what's
mels/029039.pt|well he weighs more than me stronger than me would probably beat me
mels/002829.pt|you know hurting their stock price investor confidence employees don't know if
mels/016436.pt|and and the real world impacts of it are quite apparent so
mels/006541.pt|let's have a technology company and more
mels/025116.pt|with a devious company is it possible this is a reverse ad to make breastfeeding seem
mels/027087.pt|here's the deal do any of you guys know you probably don't maybe you do the investor charlie munger yes no yes no no no
mels/024863.pt|i have to give them content yuck
mels/025044.pt|in my mind but i could be wrong nobody
mels/002629.pt|for your prediction to be true
mels/023195.pt|but they don't put this on the packaging they put this image
mels/018502.pt|are not doing that well sony owns a movie studio i don't know if you guys know that the the
mels/029809.pt|go to tournaments not practice and he will just get yes

mels/007150.pt|the eight months happiest of birthdays mr hdrexter
mels/023331.pt|is an absolute joke a charlatan of a coin down that means you buy the dip

mels/015379.pt|the wire and and sopranos and all that and ha and they've really punched above
mels/027139.pt|they basically dropped them to zero money is
mels/001924.pt|i they pay me well i it's it's
mels/020440.pt|by one vote it's perfect by one vote boys thank you for watching
mels/008287.pt|heating the other meals that i have for it and i'm not going to be keeping the minions overlay
mels/026511.pt|it's um it's very funny that the the
mels/007628.pt|and i'm like sure maybe that's true it almost certainly is true but
mels/032256.pt|and i'm like what is it you know like we
mels/022927.pt|the console is winning hates cross-platform whatever console
mels/022716.pt|but you get the idea he was a big sweaty loud yelling man who had gotten obscenely rich as microsoft grew in the
mels/025408.pt|only seen the first five seconds
mels/027145.pt|every single administration knows that it that there's a problem that inflation is starting to get worse and worse and worse but they also know that if they are the ones to pull the plug on the
mels/018790.pt|one quick light-hearted fun experience let
mels/011971.pt|there's like the smugglers who are like let's make a quick buck
mels/009864.pt|it's pretty great i think i think
mels/024200.pt|i to see like what does it actually mean
mels/031581.pt|the army with an ambush in the middle of the map while it's running back home
mels/006554.pt|the one that makes kind of any sense um
mels/024258.pt|i play his character from the matrix by the way the matrix came out
mels/003125.pt|i worked at amazon for three years
mels/022252.pt|having a job oh no he lies
mels/026782.pt|api to take because they know it's going to
mels/014227.pt|a lot bigger imagine this is someone like in the minecraft community or something it's just
mels/020979.pt|and they have like a team
mels/009073.pt|i love you hello how are things in
mels/018943.pt|i ready it's fine dude do you know how long
mels/020040.pt|it became like this foundational network that every site plugs into and now people can buy ads for any site it's
mels/000609.pt|there is a rebellion there's betrayal
mels/001204.pt|look nor taste like meat it was like literal slime dude it was like
mels/031913.pt|well where everyone's sitting like in a row
mels/028499.pt|cause i was eating the food that he bought me but anyway
mels/003314.pt|if they didn't have good news i'm sure they're not bracing for impact on a very very bad economic report on thursday i'm sure this is a complete coincidence
mels/011792.pt|and it looks like you're taking off
mels/013865.pt|as they want to do it's relatively smart and it's what they're going to do and they're definitely not
mels/007948.pt|twelve months one year of laughs pog champ
mels/010252.pt|is i get to soak up that content you know so it's like the existence of the read it that i created has inadvertently lead if people getting to see evan gao get his dick peppered which when is i get to soak up that content you know so it's like the existence of the reddit that i created has inadvertently led to people getting
mels/026792.pt|facebook anymore facebook's completely gone for them the youth doesn't
mels/004458.pt|big big a i got served an ad for jack harlow kfc what would your fast food crossover be that's
mels/005029.pt|so in fact we'll get rid of all friends
mels/014955.pt|just generally makes it a lot easier to keep your stuff in line and in order
mels/022693.pt|you have to make a hundred million
mels/028951.pt|i thought i was really sick because i
mels/002394.pt|and then i'll go to work do work and then
mels/015953.pt|you're like i can't live without it that's why they do it they do it because the more you watch netflix the
mels/022167.pt|am receiving the phone call and the mom is like not sure if the kid is dead or not and then they find out that the kid is okay only because of the subaru's
mels/022827.pt|the company will come from your company and yet your shareholders will
mels/001931.pt|right now i i work all day and then
mels/026739.pt|yo games and so as microsoft thinks about the future of the metaverse essentially they just want to build large connected gaming worlds and then the fifth reason final reason is mobile and it's also kind of part of their metaverse plan but they
mels/030167.pt|when he whatever and i just i i smoked him and
mels/028127.pt|already listed publicly so they just merge with phase clan and become
mels/006423.pt|years becoming a master blacksmith and he's agreed to turn
mels/005460.pt|met my idol and was scared to say anything other than
mels/009912.pt|generous and kind it was like if that's our hope if we're
mels/001323.pt|red roof yeah i believe this was not
mels/028824.pt|what you live in a shitty apartment
mels/022478.pt|well all i want to do all we want to do is
mels/008363.pt|way more systematic yeah i mean true technically it is not
mels/005695.pt|that is not a disney kid at all i mean yeah he's not a disney kid at all i mean
mels/025750.pt|i don't know how effective that was because it really didn't show i mean i guess i
mels/017635.pt|a comparison remember how i said verizon spends three times as much on
mels/019029.pt|i dove in on the concept of
mels/027958.pt|have the best one in my heart yes
mels/017368.pt|the robots can lie you know that is
mels/000711.pt|i'll tell you the gist of what he said
mels/031527.pt|he's the best player to ever touch a keyboard
mels/029778.pt|i mean even if you never saw this

mels/015332.pt|more money than the the biggest season of game of thrones the most expensive on wheel of time currently and no one's even talking about it okay they are throwing an absolutely ludicrous amount of money into the market to try and get
mels/008477.pt|at very competitive environment you'd be surprised how good
mels/022155.pt|add by google and with this ad by google and with this ad by google
mels/007081.pt|except for one time just to be a dick about it
mels/006546.pt|well business so they're getting it in
mels/011445.pt|nine hours to ireland i'd ask you to
mels/023614.pt|we can make money it's insane it's he literally controls her whole life and he has a legal conservatorship so he can do it she's kind of trapped okay listen this whole video
mels/031554.pt|he's not even mining from his main base and we're only like
mels/003487.pt|trying to think of what is next is there any questions i could talk about
mels/022032.pt|from brands the second one was the tsm tweet it was
mels/030277.pt|but unfortunately we had a very active
mels/024274.pt|yeah because it's so delayed and then there's nothing clever about it really and then
mels/029885.pt|in norwalk on july 4th that's how i get
mels/000839.pt|and i was like but what what did what prompts that how do you go from
mels/027232.pt|to be distinct are powerful so moving on uh
mels/004453.pt|is slurpy day good marketing like
mels/012644.pt|the thursday we'll probably do best tweets
mels/011502.pt|in stories and it was it
mels/030850.pt|okay people saw me like right
mels/023467.pt|but margin wise ford takes about eight to ten thousand dollars of plastic and steel and computer parts and makes a car and sells it for about eight
mels/010706.pt|is it every store yeah so it's like one of the i think people don't talk enough about how retail jobs actually have a huge advantage over
mels/005350.pt|when he sits down he turns around looks back
mels/018015.pt|i really i really enjoyed it and uh
mels/030938.pt|get another strike what were you playing that would
mels/026916.pt|i figure you could use a little
mels/019322.pt|as a kid you would have heard of enron
mels/016559.pt|and so we have to adapt to it there will be benefits and there could be
mels/011200.pt|what a difference yes sir yes sir
mels/015817.pt|him the money to make the show he makes the content they release it only on on netflix instead of
mels/027665.pt|you plant three tomatoes for three dollars and then take the seeds from those and then plant them again until you get nine
mels/018854.pt|of the school any publicity is good
mels/005024.pt|and yeah then what i would do is make the i
mels/007658.pt|i can promise this hand of god
mels/024550.pt|you are legally allowed to have a button that says a button or some sort of
mels/001097.pt|in college sophomore junior senior was a little bit more focused on the grind
mels/017512.pt|i will ban every single one of you who talks anything about the real names of people at my work literally every single one of
mels/021889.pt|if this guy can't win capitalism what
mels/019525.pt|clearly this is touching a personal
mels/020699.pt|of artificial preservatives of not having them means nothing when all you're
mels/021588.pt|cause not everybody is committed to the mission but all the people that heard about this from their barber or you know saw it on the news or heard about it from a friend or they're not diamond hands dude they just bought it
mels/018913.pt|of dreamworks right and dreamworks did hit the kids he did found dreamworks all right he has a pedigree he worked on
mels/014848.pt|but they already function in the same way and so adding this extra layer of needing a crypto account on top of it and and making games about monetization basically for the developer i mean
mels/023508.pt|italian foreign limited vehicles and it shows in the
mels/028672.pt|it was all gamers gamer cred was important
mels/022988.pt|it's not a good enough reason
mels/006889.pt|if you want gatorade or powerade or
mels/027539.pt|with that in mind my initial gut reaction to this is that i'm positive because it can't get worse
mels/020858.pt|the twitch who did not have college degrees and they made it to work at twitch and
mels/014343.pt|in the first is going to be in a major advantage
mels/027160.pt|well actually not doing very much about it at all because if they actually do anything it's a collapse and on the other side of it if you look at even more zoomed out crazy lens this is the
mels/003174.pt|finally passed instagram as the most
mels/015802.pt|i don't think it's like a debate really i think netflix has more
mels/009119.pt|but i'm like you know what i want to help people understand what's going on here i feel like
mels/000691.pt|a slide the thing back and the entire real restaurant is entire is behind it we
mels/004427.pt|he had to go to a spiritual retreat and really think about everything you wanted to say
mels/030722.pt|was that let's just look up quack score
mels/001767.pt|that would be better as a tick tock that
mels/009325.pt|it does not make another handheld console i
mels/021561.pt|there's this could go really high
mels/017981.pt|oh i did not mean to start the epic
mels/010537.pt|a real glue girl really because like you bring
mels/006247.pt|what holiday like what is the holiday
mels/008016.pt|if the are like it but in terms of
mels/008492.pt|what does that mean how does that solve our problem
mels/021769.pt|just tell them it was you
mels/012538.pt|so when i would come in and tap it the
mels/006334.pt|i recently i have an interview tomorrow and feel really good about it it's an interesting phrase because you
mels/010496.pt|if i'm being honest with you
mels/023007.pt|it's so big we don't give two shits we'll
mels/017835.pt|it's time to hang out and chill and do some
mels/023206.pt|white grape juice unfinished pear extract like a bunch of
mels/009869.pt|it's like as big as texas dude that's not true but
mels/016520.pt|to all in all for all these sports in the
mels/026569.pt|crap out of you and guess what i got the same
mels/015266.pt|entirely different strategy let's talk about a company that really puts money at the first first and foremost
mels/018833.pt|if the team came back and he thinks about it and it looks gross and he looks at
mels/019309.pt|i missed a lot of classes most classes i found to be quite boring and then this class came along this marketing
mels/000847.pt|we believe day months illegal bagel them with eight months illegal bagel thing in
mels/016162.pt|half this website runs on yeti
mels/011761.pt|my first thought is that's not what i
mels/013914.pt|a more in-depth one and this one i really think my audience today
mels/028351.pt|the whole company marcus heavily outranks ben
mels/022914.pt|what i love about this email exchange is how  cocky epic game sounds in
mels/019303.pt|and years and i asked him if he still had for like i said
mels/000037.pt|very mixed up country though you know different parts some part of canada that just speaks

mels/006012.pt|it's the practice a lot so i was like that must
mels/024327.pt|let's get to the big ones
mels/015874.pt|they're not going to agree to do it

mels/024015.pt|say something bad press can cost you some of your creators but
mels/003502.pt|dollars and it's not going to be enough to really make an impact so we'll see
mels/029908.pt|so like when he was a kid i feel like he was projecting those super high standards on everybody else and well yeah if somebody had just explained that
mels/014011.pt|and you could really kick off dog shampoo for example that's an interesting one
mels/015120.pt|in there was very innovative so what they had was

mels/014873.pt|the console wars a lot on this stream i do a
mels/023537.pt|where they're they they price it

mels/032407.pt|as it's forming i don't get hit here it's it's i mean
mels/020603.pt|the supreme collab and there she is signing an autograph for a tier

mels/016536.pt|you would have made three million dollars now dota 2 alone
mels/020783.pt|you've probably seen the ad i'm talking about here where they did the split down the screen but but i found that
mels/019870.pt|in any way has been a flop over hyped flop every single one has failed wow launched in
mels/004209.pt|know that we're going to get to
mels/031973.pt|it's like that's that's hbox and his crew going
mels/016589.pt|when they just basically just ripped chrome uh because it is an
mels/016048.pt|next year probably then i get back to serious
mels/026047.pt|but the beginning wave is what's fine the problem is once they get all these employees they they wield a lot of political power because they have
mels/008024.pt|when i was reading marketing material about skyrim and like it's gonna be it's
mels/001110.pt|we all have interests and you can find some that are similar and make friends over that
mels/032093.pt|six and then slime for some reason is laying on the floor across from ludwig even
mels/019165.pt|are you know what I'm saying like that's
mels/020590.pt|it's so hard to get that back a brand that good is worth it's worth so much
mels/015128.pt|sticking around longer people are signing up
mels/014364.pt|be honest they just need a larger group of people so that more creators can find
mels/013508.pt|and they are so complete opposites stanz has so much negative
mels/011161.pt|i do anything with that there's nothing
mels/004153.pt|i am in a unique position where i can be disappointed on both sides of the coin rare rare rare spot to be in zachary
mels/004021.pt|the grinder they're a degenerate stay
mels/011924.pt|want to tell you exactly what happens in
mels/029709.pt|at any moment he could turn it on because
mels/017464.pt|are standing up for their own rights when they were offered a three cent raise which was you know absurd a three
mels/029096.pt|at for baby rage because that baby would not shut the
mels/005278.pt|each other each one trying to make sure that
mels/014244.pt|watched they have big events they have esports but
mels/028168.pt|the crazily they hired a chief strategy officer named kai henry who makes a
mels/005417.pt|i like talking to youtubers um i
mels/018345.pt|i've worked at a startup twitch i
mels/017284.pt|from a certain mouse about this poo very very
mels/009237.pt|i was like eight years old i cried i cried
mels/021379.pt|and then i hope that it goes down to like 50 and then i just buy
mels/010839.pt|it's not a great viewership game or you know it's tough to understand i'm going to grind it and i'm going to get good at it and i'm going to give my team my all
mels/020806.pt|i don't get cancelled let's get to it
mels/032169.pt|the chip stack so he gives me a
mels/024633.pt|maybe it's all gonna be cocaine
mels/019463.pt|i thought that was a coke ad
mels/012804.pt|in better but i wasn't clever enough so i was just i
mels/010504.pt|i've seen it like multiple times
mels/031007.pt|i forgot what i got him it's probably a mug or something like world's best landlord or something
mels/012762.pt|do it and that guy's out there
mels/026781.pt|because if you're trying to get like a top engineer or something you can give them a stock package that they're happy
mels/018298.pt|i used to have a corolla yes
mels/014444.pt|war that's i think that's where we're at right now twitch has
mels/001734.pt|at the back in those days like they don't know
mels/007788.pt|like i put out content consistently and keep doing it keys react yeah

mels/010439.pt|i'm really excited to see you all there for sure bible
mels/012115.pt|and we're like miss timing it
mels/005961.pt|to stop it he's come with an entirely new strategy
mels/016484.pt|extremely well connected he had a document land on his desk
mels/001671.pt|for heist that formula one racing has pulled in the last three years they literally planned and executed an ultimate content
mels/023697.pt|the cliff and quit my job and and
mels/007811.pt|seen a lot of shark tanks
mels/012902.pt|but in terms of actual decisions that had real thought
mels/020602.pt|looking stunning in a gucci red dress from gucci ex supreme it's a gucci
mels/022922.pt|biggest game on playstation as you know many companies are exploring

mels/008720.pt|with the twitter bot number is flawed but that it's
mels/026885.pt|not particularly bad it's not egregious
mels/001831.pt|if people were getting paid like absurd amounts of money and the turnover there is like incredibly high because it's it's dangerous and scary and also like the demands are crazy they change all the time like you'll have an idea
mels/025178.pt|and then you guys also needed a tagline because i don't know anything about how

mels/001827.pt|city of the future but the problem is even though they have near infinite wealth near infinite wealth is not infinite wealth and to build a perfect city of
mels/009120.pt|and so i thought okay i'll explain even though the comment was rude i wrote a response explaining why
mels/004363.pt|northern lion as usual very funny guy
mels/029696.pt|it was busy so we were in the break room just playing friendlies and i could tell megan was like
mels/004548.pt|and he said yes which is crazy and then he's here right now off camera in the grew suit and i'm
mels/010572.pt|they found a way to make a commodity like oil better so i'm i'm calling him chevron
mels/017289.pt|every monthly bill so i told christopher robin that anyone can
mels/021247.pt|i've done other videos on this subject where i was a little bit more neutral the data is clear
mels/014637.pt|what's up what's up what's up what's good what's
mels/013209.pt|people that can't afford health like
mels/024310.pt|the finer things in life it's the hottest fires that make the
mels/004408.pt|first off and then i will have my guest appearance
mels/032195.pt|generally played with a hundred dollar
mels/012210.pt|and i won't have it all right
mels/022150.pt|the entire marketing industrial complex can throw at us when people tell me
mels/009756.pt|as if he's john travolta in nicholas cage's
mels/008902.pt|the end of the day this is mostly not a political thing at all like this is basically a contract negotiation from a guy that just overpaid for something and
mels/004990.pt|but what i do know is that there's two big outcomes coming forward for this twitter thing and that's one is that the letter of the
mels/025317.pt|super glad you guys all and you've created real value
mels/020614.pt|oh my god we were all
mels/014907.pt|the pipeline has run dry they finally got him with a 10 million dollar fine
mels/004430.pt|it's like wow it's like yes love that i love that i love that i love when you do one
mels/014259.pt|not just those numbers okay i missed this i'm sorry i'm just
mels/007073.pt|you know this stream will be dead
mels/010515.pt|the i'm also a fan of rick and morty right
mels/015645.pt|when streaming war and that's not big enough to justify the cost of operating service
mels/006336.pt|i recently and you're feeling good about an interview but the last time i did interview based content was a year and a half ago and everything i've done recently is
mels/028554.pt|we through it he's like all right well did
mels/007289.pt|and flick off not the crowd
mels/030582.pt|it's so clear dude i would rather be 90
mels/023721.pt|or know like if they just threw a sprite at
mels/023609.pt|siphoning all of their money like he pays himself like a
mels/005861.pt|i can't say but that was the main takeaways yeah that was the main takeaways
mels/022344.pt|and it made me think of all different ways you can use social media that's not boring another thing about this is like
mels/000394.pt|as the bachelor party ever i'm not
mels/020060.pt|the billion dollars for the rights to baby shark
mels/016211.pt|an ad and a crypto ad
mels/012993.pt|you just you do a lot of it you get obsessed with
mels/009601.pt|is not in they will lose wholeheartedly
mels/012896.pt|signing up for that resume review on linkedin at riot games that won me a
mels/003887.pt|what everyone's like because i think santa
mels/002073.pt|in the hand you know like
mels/019064.pt|teachers oh my god parents and teachers i'm
mels/031746.pt|no period after that sentence originally
mels/018812.pt|the establishment this is the early example of the
mels/017825.pt|learning a lot about amd drivers right now let me tell you i am not happy about them that is the post purchase experience it is one of the things i think nvidia has over invested in and it's made a big difference
mels/026087.pt|i wearing a tank top that being said i'm a gigantic jake and
mels/001484.pt|i've always seen you in chat but i never really know how to say it
mels/031838.pt|the right i said it right yeah if it's red it's
mels/031133.pt|if you see something working there's really nothing wrong with
mels/031975.pt|we might not know this but ludwig actually used to run and this is how i think this is kind of how you sort of start in the community
mels/020715.pt|sorry this award is for the actually kind of based award for the brand that was actually kind of based it's also slash brand tweet of the year award it's a double whammy lot of big contenders in this
mels/003196.pt|guess what baby he's out of prison after five years and he's back with a brand new web 3 drug discovery platform
mels/020643.pt|you know how you feel a little bit down um and you're like worried about how you
mels/000747.pt|but i wouldn't change them one
mels/015193.pt|put out globally but now they're realizing there is cheap good talent in all
mels/002292.pt|it would not work for a twitch streamer
mels/014931.pt|to marketing monday on a wednesday today's topic the streaming wars and i'm not talking about the ones where youtube buys ludwig or dr disrespect gets banned i'm talking about the ones that are about
mels/024903.pt|do things like um they will make you feel
mels/024328.pt|where the money starts to get really intense number three
mels/024950.pt|well quotes from the comments of that video that i thought were interesting this person named depression said when i first saw this video two years ago i
mels/025827.pt|in the effect because i'll show you this graph
mels/017043.pt|usually that's the whole day but then i just i also played games and
mels/017763.pt|where the highest sub attachment rates on all of
mels/012269.pt|with the actors and anyway should we
mels/029012.pt|oh dude oh go on the beach man go run on
mels/028559.pt|so they don't count it as income which
mels/015220.pt|for every consumer in every market and that means even if they don't you know gain a lot of ground in america it doesn't matter as much they can have a bunch of cheap great shows that americans will still love
mels/018924.pt|who were promising investors that if you
mels/029542.pt|way down we road trip from norcal
mels/005894.pt|i'm the fall guy is what he would like to be referred to as and uh i just we couldn't allow him to
mels/008274.pt|it's like wait a minute that guy's so good
mels/001499.pt|i'm pretty sure your favorite color is green
mels/014223.pt|and that means you only go to these platforms when you're already big which is not a way to build a service that is not a way to to grow up and that means like if
mels/015902.pt|doesn't this end up worse than cable because instead of
mels/014832.pt|some of them are scam sale
mels/026160.pt|is not dead blizzard's still innovating
mels/010908.pt|and there are a number of those and we don't really need to do
mels/004222.pt|it's just like there's the amount
mels/024244.pt|where it's like they want to associate microsoft with technology for the betterment of humanity i thought it was
mels/005245.pt|you know i understand that things can sometimes come off awkward when they're not okay i can understand that but this guy in front of me he i'm just talking to
mels/021820.pt|it's famously i sell books to now i sell
mels/023409.pt|if the things they make the money back if you just showed up at costco for the
mels/010948.pt|all right now here we go we got a video for you i got a video for you i think the cooldown is five minutes but i am not a hundred percent
mels/025076.pt|sugary cereal but now it's whole grain guaranteed so you know it's healthy i'm just
mels/009471.pt|and if we put him on
mels/017909.pt|actually i have more to say
mels/006096.pt|let me just tell you hbox pops
mels/015515.pt|if their strategy it's basically just a hobby it's basically something they do
mels/002976.pt|camera goes off and we're in the theater in darkness and
mels/002836.pt|worse to complete the deal so he is trying to drag this out he won the
mels/020101.pt|and you're buying the company just to get the people and so what they did was apple spent
mels/020814.pt|do the award for marketer of the year goes to okay i'm pretty sure this is a
mels/023590.pt|it's twitter account called brands getting owned and we're
mels/027412.pt|intuit realized that would cost them a lot of money so they drastically ramped up their lobbying spending and started paying politicians and paying lobbyists to slow this down or stop it and eventually the compromise they agreed to
mels/009986.pt|the live on a saturday night so
mels/000515.pt|we get some breakfast and it's all good and then
mels/002019.pt|that is brain dead the balls are the
mels/015678.pt|the fierce competitors these three companies are fierce as competitors and if you're not one of these three it's going to get harder and harder for you so my prediction is that almost all
mels/016256.pt|and i strolled i strolled from today all the
mels/006577.pt|and though what i assume happened is that morbius made all of the money on earth on its first viewing you know what i'm saying and this second time was like when you
mels/024235.pt|former nfl players steve gleason of the new orleans saints and that cost money
mels/023071.pt|so the marketing in fact in food has gotten extremely good for example if i were to buy engine parts okay those are very specialized i
mels/010289.pt|want to waste her time i wouldn't want to get
mels/001740.pt|he realizes that if he if someone were to go overboard on the ship the ship would have to stop and turn around and pick them up and it would slow them down
mels/003407.pt|towards possibly doing something related to taiwan basically military action related
mels/032079.pt|up with he was writing it all the
mels/001213.pt|there's a lot of like online small businesses if you were if you had a unique
mels/011026.pt|it's going so far we're in we're tuesday
mels/024895.pt|them one and system two system one is our
mels/010703.pt|you one hundred thousand dollars to quit and buy
mels/022211.pt|his daughter good i mean i actually don't know what doc morris is but i assume if it's just healthcare that's pretty fair if they sold
mels/000186.pt|never seen the hangover that's actually
mels/025159.pt|it's week with a brand new
mels/021623.pt|it's kind of like slice of life stuff and then you
mels/023742.pt|the audio quality it's all great
mels/018518.pt|i buying um exclusive production deals with
mels/028748.pt|and i'm like yo what's up and then
mels/024638.pt|collapsed completely they had hundreds of billions of dollars in debt due to pay today that they have defaulted on means
mels/031651.pt|i got like the only korean interviews at one point
mels/030814.pt|i can do this anyway that that oh sea otters paul champ
mels/032285.pt|and they take everything and they just
mels/011091.pt|it's x king that's what it was sphynx
mels/029938.pt|i right from league and even still near the end he wasn't he'd never like he never touched the
mels/024397.pt|probably find a different concept if the concept for your ad requires you to
mels/004226.pt|it's not like a big deal it's not like if they did it like in the height of
mels/027670.pt|make twitter very profitable very quickly let's see what that is
mels/032263.pt|i called into the gambling gods i don't
mels/007296.pt|at the crowd and i said i will bet any amount of money on any game for j
mels/001153.pt|your whenever you're good your brain is so rotted you thought factor sponsored mangle and gave him a
mels/010565.pt|you thought you were my best man you cutie cinderella we're under the
mels/019567.pt|my name is michael levine i'm a composer and songwriter they had a campaign they already loved and they just needed a throwaway
mels/031243.pt|and i was like oh i'm not going to miss this game
mels/028852.pt|i'm like i'll remember this like oh this pushy is
mels/001431.pt|let me get the music okay yeah i will tell you i was kicked
mels/016522.pt|make in idaho you know over a year that's if you
mels/004667.pt|if the the five gift that i do appreciate that and ghoul incorporated
mels/022493.pt|and some of the best and the worst ones and we shall include an april
mels/017363.pt|the live plug with a penny the girl asked
mels/022623.pt|he they were looking for someone to be the role that i wrote for angry gamer
mels/020832.pt|to be named your marketer of the year i will treasure this marketing monday award this monday for as long as i may live
mels/023747.pt|ten minutes could save you 15
mels/028239.pt|in the other interview that has been such a difference i was hiring somebody for a social media role in marketing i know who's good at this kind of job and i knew what to look for
mels/008509.pt|which would have netted me a lot of money had it gone through instantly
mels/005994.pt|i just really despise it dude and it
mels/009952.pt|six nine six nine six thank
mels/028997.pt|so where you got can beat a
mels/022405.pt|so that's the ad but there's there's multiples they all revolved around they would get the point across in the first i
mels/025810.pt|lot of reasons that they have been diverged okay but the main theme i want to have is
mels/030754.pt|it sometimes you could tell right off the bat a
mels/019134.pt|is it that was it that was it that was it
mels/011519.pt|to do but when i'm locked on a
mels/008863.pt|the period of endless back and forth
mels/009784.pt|is collapsing but germany being in bad economic times has never
mels/008709.pt|as five percent i i feel like
mels/024530.pt|allow me to read the codes anyway i'm gonna tell
mels/011755.pt|anyway that was he it's in the outer rim
mels/024802.pt|youtubers again always sharing their insane luck
mels/019095.pt|there is a limited supply of people who look amazing on camera and
mels/031603.pt|the food was the free food the snacks in the press room at dreamhack it was like coca-cola bottles
mels/007067.pt|i got to meet a lot of people
mels/028846.pt|so it was like it was like
mels/012966.pt|you gotta try to be good at it
mels/016023.pt|it makes a marketing monday yes yes i'm trying to pivot out of
mels/007673.pt|tell me true tell me honestly
mels/011029.pt|put my face on a statue
mels/002919.pt|blowing up expectations now it's going to be a few days before
mels/010024.pt|your videos ready if you've got videos one out of ten huzzah hooray
mels/031693.pt|it's beautiful i watched it in the original
mels/009177.pt|at all those streamers and hung out with
mels/000539.pt|and we all open them and we all have one of the four seasons and it was like a
mels/030343.pt|i was at a party with with women at it
mels/000003.pt|big a chug so many red bulls
mels/015343.pt|it needs to be good to save their business because amazon doesn't need the content to be good no one on their side is really passionate about making good content which means a lot of their shows end up worse than they could be okay on the exact opposite of that spectrum is hbo max but first i'm
mels/029270.pt|with the squad the greatest squad
mels/029550.pt|experience and i think part of the reason we'd hoped for it yeah
mels/027630.pt|this is actually the take that i think almost no one's talking about that i think is my final big concern so the amount of money was
mels/005745.pt|i don't even want to say a nat dude he literally has to have attention on him at all times and and everyone at the table
mels/020107.pt|and get him back and around here he becomes ceo so right
mels/009829.pt|if the for seven is like a toyota uh
mels/001210.pt|and you're like out of high
mels/016340.pt|a marketing dub okay he's never had a marketing dub until now and that is why
mels/015578.pt|several started going outside again they weren't stuck inside
mels/020960.pt|like literally changing your mind is a chad thing to do um don't feel like you have to win
mels/002335.pt|same old nothing new hot tubs times
mels/021394.pt|and they were actually shorting as in borrowing more stock than there was available
mels/031230.pt|in america so what i would do is i would
mels/008568.pt|but they're not they're they're saying
mels/014590.pt|is huge because they count uh
mels/031680.pt|in the league of legends with miz kif
mels/027792.pt|a little bit and talking about raising them more is what's
mels/001411.pt|three and d three and d three
mels/015147.pt|make that money netflix does not have that
mels/005204.pt|if the throttle and take down my internet and so they said are you sure because we'd love to give you great quality affordable service that never has any
mels/016147.pt|don't change your life based on that that
mels/011829.pt|this is not galaxy's edge this is called the galactic star cruiser it's like
mels/014290.pt|a chart that i am calling
mels/031776.pt|what might have happened with the final four episodes that sounds amazing
mels/021153.pt|from metro wow so tell me more about
mels/004177.pt|late night elden ring maybe that's
mels/024165.pt|was like him lupo tim courage and so youtube and twitch
mels/017428.pt|what a big fail and make fun of you because that's a good way to
mels/012620.pt|they were talking about everything on the way out they were like okay
mels/031171.pt|he cares about that stuff he wants to be number one that's his goal and he hit it and i'm
mels/002612.pt|with the people of this chat to see a victory it's called win a
mels/028743.pt|at one point had the most
mels/023482.pt|if a car buyer and has an average salary about
mels/018861.pt|well this ad I gotta go I'm
mels/008295.pt|i could do it while studying math it bangs something like that i gotta be honest
mels/016270.pt|i can't believe it you think the leader
mels/024193.pt|the real showdown between youtube gaming and twitch a lot more
mels/001206.pt|getting as a team if you're a teen
mels/023862.pt|an attempt to get people to talk about coke zero sugar the truth is if they hadn't changed the formula and just rebranded this wouldn't get as much discussion and people now want to try the flavors they want to have a stance they want to say what's best the whole thing to me feels a little more calculated this time around wait i gotta go
mels/022948.pt|as dominant okay let's make this a huge win for us all epic is not changing its mind on the issue so let's just agree on it now that is the most cold final line i've ever seen in
mels/024136.pt|we're all the support and love over all these years it's time for the next big thing of my career the future
mels/014600.pt|so no i wouldn't consider it it would be a bad
mels/017402.pt|do you actually add an image and to get
mels/000672.pt|bear in mind we were up thousands we were up a lot of money so again not all this is like dead loss at the end of the
mels/015648.pt|about getting a big streaming service but i don't think it's going to work it's not
mels/016383.pt|it is just it's just it's just hundreds
mels/004249.pt|the tanks the tanks video is fake that is from
mels/032109.pt|bloor was high he was laying on the
mels/001695.pt|the second he gets a golden ticket they dudes up
mels/012290.pt|it's fun and it's cool to be in the finals so
mels/014462.pt|it's not a huge deal it would be
mels/012517.pt|his first year or whatever and they're
mels/023444.pt|a business or even think about your own personal brand you should think about the word margin brand should just be a fancy word for the word margin okay so let me start with the three lines and
mels/005259.pt|the like directing it he's making a bigger
mels/012836.pt|did when they bought the company was look at the expense report or whatever and they were
mels/019537.pt|if the care you got a better functioning government but you haven't figured out marketing
mels/026465.pt|with the quick quick and easy one but i wanted to
mels/018263.pt|why stop it it's a one but it's betw it's a lot of
mels/009602.pt|you basically say if you're not with
mels/012590.pt|in three disney is parks revenues rebounding
mels/030619.pt|and then i got to the house in germany and i plugged in my
mels/029200.pt|what do you said that brings me back
mels/029827.pt|let me cut you off right here ben you in
mels/006256.pt|so be there okay be there or miss one of
mels/022427.pt|in pictures movies stuff like that
mels/017107.pt|i dunno how much money you have i don't know
mels/001207.pt|like if you are 14 years old don't get
mels/011339.pt|yeah so thursday probably off to do it
mels/027206.pt|they were hand-holding quite a bit and this went
mels/008125.pt|because i'll never use thank you and have a good one not appreciating my gift
mels/002907.pt|watching in a different home and uh and if you you
mels/023132.pt|at millions of dollars on an ad campaign to turn locusts into sky prawns
mels/021912.pt|to get started it doesn't want to move no part of this is easy
mels/024510.pt|if you have to give us our
mels/027167.pt|the value of my shiba coin yes so
mels/031419.pt|look at this it's just dominating the
mels/023344.pt|because literally okay look he's not
mels/031720.pt|is that mean it didn't end
mels/020217.pt|the website was shut down and not much remains except for these and also this text document
mels/012150.pt|how do i do that deactivating the droid is deceptively simple
mels/019267.pt|then I saw a tweet that was so powerful
mels/020996.pt|and that's exactly where i think it
mels/002647.pt|six-sided dice okay but here's the catch you will say a number every time that number does not come up i will add ten dollars to your total theoretically you could print infinite money if
mels/001894.pt|when it comes from ads nothing zero i
mels/015044.pt|it's very simple chart every year in the early
mels/024201.pt|to let somebody big go they did it with ninja they let ninja go it didn't hurt
mels/006478.pt|strip club so pretty a pretty interesting
mels/022257.pt|okay well yeah i wasn't i wasn't expecting man literally i was like cracking a joke for the first
mels/010832.pt|which is also awesome so it's kind of a
mels/019018.pt|everywhere at once do you need them to be at a mcdonald's there they are the travel costs of getting a bunch of influencers out to shanghai paying for their hotel paying for their flights paying for them to do social
mels/024574.pt|but you might be thinking why did epic really i mean listen they got they got a little
mels/000454.pt|start getting everyone on board the blt train and so now german wants a blt stands
mels/001201.pt|i don't think i would eat
mels/023266.pt|no you can't it's marketing you
mels/019670.pt|the meetings and stuff like that so i do like
mels/019081.pt|it was just using technology social media and
mels/015999.pt|with the competition once one of them wins or
mels/010067.pt|so we are going to launch in
mels/028773.pt|what are you making now they want to know exactly what you're making now so they don't offer you too much more they only offer you a little bit more and
mels/007729.pt|my weekend was awesome i got blackout drunk saturday and sunday night
mels/012738.pt|with the you put the time in not even you don't have to get better
mels/032364.pt|obvious reasons okay first of all i completed literally every boss every regular boss hitless on stream
mels/010626.pt|he pulled me into a call alone and we sat there for three four hours and he walked me through everything in smite like like not even playing the game like opened up the
mels/024553.pt|it says go to web go to safari and you can you can can it be a link so that's the
mels/018488.pt|after all let me try to give you guys a sense of
mels/026670.pt|and they said hey you need to pay us a hundred million dollars to get the rights for overwatch league to stream on twitch this
mels/017596.pt|to stand out from your competitors
mels/002094.pt|the thing about hearthstone that i love is the the
mels/016003.pt|what's stopping them is that no
mels/027266.pt|for that had like missing rivets doors that weren't hinged properly and they were
mels/024755.pt|been around in various forms across mobile for a long time
mels/015728.pt|but they don't really they don't pirate as much as uh as you'd
mels/003655.pt|but it's not going to be because
mels/028158.pt|what the may just be bank or they just be
mels/005707.pt|conversation i i enjoyed talking to
mels/020275.pt|the holidays they openly show their
mels/009720.pt|yeah i'm getting too many questions pliers remove nails
mels/020264.pt|we forgot to include anything that reminds you of a product so they just take
mels/010788.pt|with your point at least on your own
mels/031293.pt|i the security guard caught me i
mels/020046.pt|it's a monopoly over online advertising yes sir three in a row google acquisitions are three of the greatest of all time this is of course where you guys watch your jake paul
mels/022131.pt|it's only when you get slimy with it that people really start to get angry that was the end of my presentation and i thought those were all pretty funny but i want to take a look at some of yours is this this was an email this is unfortunate because you have to schedule these emails well ahead to get everything ready but congrats you survived the boston marathon
mels/007593.pt|we did connect we talked about it
mels/018633.pt|and they um they play games
mels/023497.pt|their market share gets too big they lose the exclusive value of
mels/026832.pt|it's how early you bought it seven million
mels/016046.pt|there so i'm thinking about doing that but until the
mels/013148.pt|in order to make good games you can just go into
mels/010499.pt|it's the opposite i want i don't i'd rather have a firefly season than a community movie
mels/012317.pt|what's it cost and then it was like well it's not
mels/008589.pt|so good and so much better than what they could get elsewhere they would basically be sued by shareholders like me if they didn't take the deal because
mels/025458.pt|work experience for every project you're involved in
mels/009130.pt|i thought i'd carved out a little slice of the internet where people
mels/015234.pt|i did about for original content netflix has more than the rest of the
mels/028958.pt|on a trip to japan or they
mels/006395.pt|speaking of corporations doing the right thing i want to give a big win to companies that really believe in their employees that
mels/004144.pt|that if somebody pays me to do a sponsorship and then i say yes i'll do it and then i don't do it for a month
mels/003932.pt|who took a massive chunk of the votes by
mels/025686.pt|is not a great way to market a product because it has nothing to do with the product at the end of the day you remembering that creepy baby does not imply that you are more or like less likely to buy a playstation so it was kind of
mels/027433.pt|are committed to protecting your investment and your tenants hashtag owners and neighbors and it got with paid literally zero
mels/009132.pt|buying twitter i said look hey twitter's
mels/025937.pt|people aren't really enjoying the competitive
mels/019868.pt|the point of this i'm making every single
mels/006371.pt|is he apparently to make a guild in the game it costs you
mels/025397.pt|oh my fashion icon slime dude that's
mels/025008.pt|it's about gaming brands most hated gaming brands and i
mels/024094.pt|two seconds ago they said that
mels/029347.pt|it was nice place right off the lot it's where
mels/030865.pt|i just got hit with some shrapnel i passed out and i dreamed this entire
mels/016378.pt|i mean that didn't technically go to fraudulent pure fraud people that just didn't have
mels/004937.pt|he pays which is why i sold while
mels/031454.pt|directly into the water well over his
mels/026547.pt|more recently and he created a game called verbatim
mels/013748.pt|if he thinks is overvalued i know that whenever i say
mels/009380.pt|that's how you win these tournaments
mels/016840.pt|this one is ai this is
mels/012482.pt|text messages can i still open that data
mels/013928.pt|use these products is because they are afraid of credit card debt in fact one of the main drivers of klarna's audience
mels/012171.pt|pad it's like yeah go to go to the space
mels/007203.pt|i wouldn't like dude please please please let him
mels/026694.pt|do another hondo millie and somehow this man despite consistently lower viewership every year manages to get another big deal with youtube this is again i
mels/002536.pt|there's a full 30 second timer to
mels/028805.pt|i was like well just don't
mels/019593.pt|thus we can bridge the gap i'm gonna put this in a solid a tier i think this is the best
mels/021489.pt|do the short the contract they make because
mels/000185.pt|why the details of the plot of the movie the hangover that we watched on night one
mels/010636.pt|it's a little emerald gassy bam i would
mels/004405.pt|wait till he drops the pps pps you do
mels/018167.pt|in the seventh layer of hell
mels/001603.pt|well i know that are in my situation they're
mels/014071.pt|complete with sorry i need to find this real quick
mels/007251.pt|more content i think just to get to get on sponsors like radar a little bit but his
mels/028678.pt|boys today's video is about a very special topic near and dear to my heart how the hell a
mels/030567.pt|well this one's good that's going in the invitation right there that's just not you
mels/014937.pt|the streaming wars but before we jump into it i think i have to do one question from my sponsor before we jump into it let's do
mels/015781.pt|big enough to have a major impact but it is look there's a lot of there's like
mels/012048.pt|instead of this line the wall just kind of glows in the direction of
mels/009092.pt|i mean my youtube history here we go wait hold wait oh yeah this is it here's one i mean my youtube history here we go wait hold wait oh yeah this is it here's one right now okay i got it um i got it i got it i got it i got it i
mels/029245.pt|is off the charts starcraft is truly production values and it's all
mels/013287.pt|and i think they're pretty good although
mels/002738.pt|take it take the deal a hundred and fifty
mels/029587.pt|talked about how you felt from zayn like he was
mels/027193.pt|calling prototype and no one else wanted to work on it he wanted to work on it because he figured if i could find a way to take
mels/006498.pt|on every goddamn iphone in the world
mels/025706.pt|crux of this ad he's scared he gets the
mels/003142.pt|war snapchat is dead and the company lost
mels/030072.pt|i want is in november or whenever this game comes
mels/016379.pt|like potbelly and applebee's and big
mels/028955.pt|homesick oh oh also at one point
mels/029763.pt|to air i'm so glad i got to see
mels/022885.pt|that was apple's opening argument that
mels/007409.pt|go to a melee tournament and i know everybody i'd walk around i know i'm
mels/003543.pt|i selling now would mean you're selling at
mels/010202.pt|at you you were worried that it was too
mels/008857.pt|i can do that i think it's possible that both parties agree to that because here's the deal the real
mels/017746.pt|if you feel better about your purchase after
mels/019188.pt|word that the average person would say Nintendo was just video games
mels/016308.pt|back injuries strains sprains repetitive stress injuries and more you can get them four times as likely
mels/030708.pt|they spoon feed quack one what color is
mels/005585.pt|so there's more than a pizza per person it's literally
mels/028891.pt|with her this is all secondhand story so again
mels/023052.pt|their ambitions because they're not gonna have
mels/015062.pt|we're up with this love this show they got it for 30 million dollars a year which is
mels/020502.pt|all this up and live in a shack in poland if i could work at
mels/012837.pt|money on this vegas tournament let's cancel it because it was like a
mels/014612.pt|i gotta keep going this strategy so think about
mels/000925.pt|the wedding no negotiation over who's next
mels/032289.pt|i walked away with nothing i learned something about vegas and that's that if you want to
mels/006325.pt|the for me to not take the moral high ground in any way but actually
mels/019769.pt|is illusory it's not real it's not gonna
mels/027420.pt|with everybody makes mistakes everybody has those days trying to be quote unquote relatable cool for them i guess and then
mels/029768.pt|so air is this really cool neither of you guys have ever been to an air tournament i have not
mels/020443.pt|what is happening and where is it going let's talk about cyberpunk here's what i want to say so the
mels/008124.pt|it's one of those things i don't need because
mels/009676.pt|it was half the money you make
mels/005543.pt|the i was like i have
mels/009115.pt|do frog lemonade oh by the way i hate you
mels/030136.pt|he's annoyed but he would be
mels/024417.pt|with all three are you putting them all together that's what i want to see so that's my first
mels/016697.pt|him crazy now as the internet seemed crazy
mels/012545.pt|ips would be good to do this with like i
mels/024512.pt|i said it's not fair we have to give you
mels/029910.pt|so he's like obviously going to act out a bit like if they just had his side of the story on that a little bit
mels/020261.pt|all ads you have to feature the product this is true of all ads every out of you have to say it but it's
mels/016133.pt|i worried that i got omicron
mels/006776.pt|what a miserable game what a miserable game that was
mels/021983.pt|i called him yesterday he has worked at an amazon
mels/017052.pt|if you've made an impact on my life man how recently you
mels/025737.pt|with the product it's like yeah that's called a movie it's like if i watched
mels/014383.pt|or worse the live experience is buggier
mels/006092.pt|okay well that's funny i should have explained i didn't even think about that
mels/031433.pt|it's a perfect photo as you can see i'm scoping out who's open ludwig doesn't have the form
mels/006091.pt|that's why it's hilarious i'm sorry
mels/004103.pt|this is i i need to be very careful with this but i need you guys to truly understand that i'm not really joking here i'm not really joking
mels/013805.pt|hold up wait a minute let me put some
mels/029826.pt|it's so good and in my mind when he said that
mels/010596.pt|that's funny because this is literally my old time that i normally did every day until i started getting really busy and so all the
mels/008414.pt|it was like bro i do the exact same thing with yours which means we are literally human
mels/006587.pt|but we'll see how it does on
mels/015402.pt|so that that's given them a second
mels/005456.pt|i can just look at a couple
mels/004657.pt|i yeah i'm excited for a little bit of a weekend
mels/023785.pt|if it was a truck i guess i could see the association oh it's calgary oh oh
mels/015010.pt|it competitors all with billions of dollars and tons of content are showing up to the battlefield first up we have the lion we have the
mels/016232.pt|you autozone jingle and now king
mels/031559.pt|in a tightly cramped space and
mels/014358.pt|right now they use like instagram live who's
mels/014930.pt|a little bit of juice in between i would like you guys to tag yourself as we jump into marketing
mels/019096.pt|well who are entertaining enough v
mels/023666.pt|in march and put three thousand dollars down and
mels/018023.pt|bad examples good and bad examples i would like to show you what may be the greatest example of all time
mels/001932.pt|trim at night and it's like i like both of
mels/025971.pt|world of warcraft money there are a class of people that are simply unable to leave wow they put too much
mels/014108.pt|these these two years are the
mels/026053.pt|the touch live plugs with pennies i don't know what caused it i don't know but this is a true story this actually happened i thought it was fake i looked into it it
mels/026917.pt|all the all electric the bmw i all electric all electric the bmw ix
mels/030617.pt|and i was playing pokemon and it was warm and it was awesome and i would play outside and then we moved to germany and i got out of the plane and it was frigid winter
mels/003888.pt|is the favorite right now he's actually the favorite overall if you look at betting odds but i think trump is
mels/026922.pt|they got two big time celebrities they made the
mels/020278.pt|rose celebrities on them this is not that
mels/025961.pt|and with blizzard this has been meteoric this is four studios formed in the past
mels/031825.pt|i think literally it is amaranth and
mels/028620.pt|basically he thought he could get diamond before me
mels/001402.pt|when people cheat on online stream based trivia i hate it
mels/002329.pt|and we're going to watch them so much
mels/026031.pt|the me today and what's interesting about this is over half of those employees were added during the pandemic
mels/027978.pt|they did to invest in crypto not a joke i
mels/026893.pt|actually not wrong right after after they paid for the
mels/010245.pt|for charity whatever and then i get a notification later that i got outbid by a lot and then it kept
mels/012241.pt|so jenny draws two cards flips them over
mels/025999.pt|fake a deep voice buy a bunch of
mels/004615.pt|erected every goddamn song you think i
mels/010576.pt|he has a unique ability to want to leave a room that he's in and the second i open
mels/001539.pt|or red and he's like i
mels/022624.pt|and i was like i can do it i mean i i generally have an angry gamer and what's funny is none and i was like well i can do it i mean i i generally am an angry gamer
mels/004741.pt|free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated said mr musk i also want to make twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features making the algorithms open source to increase trust defeating the spam bots and
mels/023425.pt|it's advice i can give most
mels/014089.pt|kicking off every single person who
mels/019935.pt|that's the idea okay number one this is acquisitions not mergers so for example
mels/028750.pt|your boy is in by the way i don't end up
mels/019478.pt|and it charts number one i
mels/027440.pt|which would have been cringe enough before it went up she posted this on
mels/009240.pt|thank you for the uh couple months we're
mels/016459.pt|i don't know his last name but wayne offbeat also by the way
mels/030372.pt|it knows the apartment better than me so i constantly was shuffling it around to different spots that i would even forget where
mels/002580.pt|right now just for saying the word
mels/023234.pt|the sugary it's dessert basically this
mels/032088.pt|right on that joke is when you realize that was all he got to
mels/013693.pt|and it's a guy who's been
mels/027348.pt|more widespread phenomenon and and it's it's it's not just
mels/003341.pt|on that and then i'll do one funny one to
mels/009391.pt|out of it double lift maybe
mels/025440.pt|who is now sentient who nods back so pepsi may have
mels/000513.pt|i'm fine thank god for that blt it gave me
mels/029350.pt|the reason i need this internship is because i moved to california with no money to try and make a job in esports where at the time has no money
mels/014475.pt|and you know what i'm not
mels/009849.pt|that hold way more people than
mels/009737.pt|the problem is his fingers are too big
mels/009938.pt|it is that bad but it is a little bit of bullying like
mels/007202.pt|really wanted it but felt shy to ask like he didn't want to ask so i told
mels/004587.pt|it's that was the f was i was restarting because you just showed
mels/019012.pt|wasn't followers on instagram to do
mels/026020.pt|the pooh becomes public domain so i think you can see where this is going winnie the screwed chapter one
mels/017523.pt|i have invented a something you can spam when i talk about the clock model you can say yep clock i want to give you guys a chance to be a participate you know the problem with three lines there is no way for you guys to mean so now you can say yep clock alright i i have invented a something you can spam when i talk about the clock model you can say yep clock i want to give you guys a chance to be
mels/019354.pt|minus 12 million dollars on research and
mels/031899.pt|what should i say i got this whole thing
mels/005237.pt|with that anime expo and she had friends who wanted to come along we got them tickets so i brought them so i get to the back of this line alright it's a fucking with the anime expo and she had friends who wanted to come along we got him tickets
mels/014182.pt|if they make you do as you
mels/022048.pt|one by one woman who worked at denny's and wasn't being monitored that closely once people saw that was successful all hell broke loose but that began an era of brand social but as the years have gone on and we've all gotten a little more
mels/031246.pt|earlier today in between the games we had gone to a mall in atlanta and there was free wi-fi in the food court
mels/031103.pt|it makes right now i'm pretty sure very soon not only will he make more than us he'll
mels/026158.pt|i just a week ago uh if you
mels/026302.pt|yeah of the clock they used to be a bigger advertising company but they really have
mels/011686.pt|my thought is this is this is not necessarily our honeymoon
mels/009812.pt|interesting and i'm saying interesting to be nice economic times right now certainly america is not immune and
mels/019682.pt|did you have any future jingles playing
mels/015714.pt|i and everything and it's like it's nice
mels/013020.pt|and i feel like you're retains
mels/002655.pt|the serengeti mixed with an anime
mels/023090.pt|okay there have been many many studies
mels/017638.pt|wigan dollars to open this is
mels/018534.pt|why bethesda because it prints dollar bills okay you buy bethesda because owning the
mels/031712.pt|are small enough that the viewer base of
mels/010856.pt|and that is a little cringe because
mels/019014.pt|is astronomically expensive but if you own the
mels/021400.pt|i would not bet on gamestop for the long term but it's not dead it's not going to zero so he's like wow this
mels/012508.pt|also i've lost way more than
mels/021412.pt|last time a short squeeze this big happened
mels/031227.pt|we get farther in the tournament
mels/023308.pt|he might have handled this you know what i'm saying this is a very smart seasoned pr strategy to just get it away to just
mels/017563.pt|three billion verizon 3 billion verizon a
mels/008513.pt|elect somebody was actually gonna go through
mels/008968.pt|it's a lot of things that he is signing that he agrees that like he's he's reviewed all that he wants to review about twitter he agrees to buy it as is
mels/003225.pt|the growth of the game is dependent entirely
mels/030590.pt|mexico egypt peru or sudan easy clap probably mexico
mels/009670.pt|was maybe a little elder ring and then
mels/028597.pt|at the beginning of the season but i stabilized at around
mels/004922.pt|in the firings so the company has
mels/029384.pt|and like you know that shouldn't be such a crime
mels/021332.pt|it's a human response to ever increasing isolation people need to belong in a group they need some kind of human connection and i think i think we're in an era of of really extreme profound loneliness so and also
mels/019932.pt|acquisitions of all time let me give
mels/028038.pt|the progress unions are making and they are literally focusing insane efforts for example starbucks just announced an illegal wage increase that would only apply to
mels/018141.pt|our past the pepsi truck pass the pepsi truck past the workers
mels/003611.pt|about that the number of people living with their parents
mels/022238.pt|turning their ipad into a surrogate parent every single problem has been dealt by toss the kids
mels/012439.pt|in time so the it's designed to make you go
mels/002428.pt|big bang bullets thinking of the prime
mels/019783.pt|what the game was going to be like
mels/030838.pt|i stream and and what one of them said was i don't remember the exact line it was just something to the effect of like are you wearing a tank top right now
mels/016325.pt|that probably boosted sales in ireland though i gotta be honest
mels/020388.pt|easily yeah good votes this is this is really good i wouldn't i don't think i'd change anything i
mels/006436.pt|in existence this orb can be used as a power source in the upcoming space exploration game and should give your guild a great advantage
mels/023187.pt|that that the idea of fruit is healthy and so anytime they can add the word fruit to anything they will do it and so one of the big ones that you hear a lot is made with real fruit that essentially means this
mels/027783.pt|of course more than everything the
mels/005178.pt|going to be a real fun it was they were
mels/023602.pt|the a better solution than that it's a good start
mels/005690.pt|i have no i thought carl jacobs was like
mels/016621.pt|next this one is just kind of
mels/024990.pt|and made some ads and everyone voted the wrong way and uber got off
mels/026033.pt|employees first of all given the fact they have very high churn which is like people that join and then quit so it's one of the largest hirings in one year it is the largest hiring of one year of any company in history uh the closest is
mels/013008.pt|a way to make it where you're going deep on one thing at a time so you just you have to learn that before you can move on would be sick
mels/016394.pt|under biden and they both have had massive amounts of fraud and basically
mels/015863.pt|it's how they see their future going forward netflix gaming
mels/025785.pt|but more importantly they have nothing to announce this is the key thing i guarantee you if
mels/001481.pt|what if there's a question oh i've got a question ha perfect i'm
mels/005306.pt|always awkward i've been that person a million
mels/008710.pt|it's that seems more likely to what i'm saying and even if it's higher that that
mels/001624.pt|title this video i have a video of my first day playing the new hitman map where i set the world record a couple
mels/025473.pt|is a huge deal um stanz
mels/002507.pt|part of the whole game to me was that reveal
mels/029218.pt|was their best player he was a protoss player from korea they had side as a carpet a waiting me to do man i'm here to help out was their best player he was a protoss player from korea they had signed i was like hot bit uh what do you need
mels/004227.pt|that would have been a big message
mels/022052.pt|step one is they don't know what the hashtag is before they post so here's an example of
mels/021715.pt|preach corporation preach this is sad who
mels/027785.pt|calling at once the real cause here is the following inflation is that all-time highs it's it's spiking and not slowing down because in

mels/001465.pt|as the musician for or quack one of the two
mels/026318.pt|we have revolutionized this part of the clock the purchase part of the clock previously when you buy electronics you would go to a place like best buy or perhaps a poor online experience first

mels/015093.pt|at once okay all of hollywood started waking up and saying hey you better pay us like
mels/031621.pt|team liquid and he was on team liquid so it was like the biggest party i remember him showing up to a club with glasses on at night like it's a
mels/028266.pt|king nightmare i mean it was like the it was like the

mels/011619.pt|the honeymoon and i sort of looked around at different options and i thought of the fact that ari well first
mels/026736.pt|we're talk about this in my next marketing monday
mels/020077.pt|instagram is worth hundreds of billions of dollars it is the
mels/008306.pt|in about probably five minutes yeah
mels/016857.pt|a million dollars plus in salary
mels/016903.pt|worms this could be uh coaching this this
mels/003425.pt|ash point between the two big military powers
mels/007321.pt|which i think was like five to one or
mels/003780.pt|that that was put forward and and it was good dude it was pretty good
mels/028047.pt|what are the union sending a clear message to every single one of their other managers that if you don't do something to stop
mels/006128.pt|wow quincy plushies oh i have
mels/025864.pt|if we've already got you playing
mels/016407.pt|it makes me kind of sick makes me kind of uh mad makes me kind of angry

mels/005233.pt|where's the where's the ludwig event you know but it wasn't like everyone in line was legitimately there for mogul money live it was like it was like whoa
mels/011513.pt|well likes the irs the irs
mels/031861.pt|when good the viewership's still good
mels/032248.pt|fat stack of chips and starts betting
mels/020089.pt|we've pretty well it goes public and it's worth a billion dollars and he realizes he's not cut out currently at his age he's not cut out to be ceo so he goes to pepsi and he tells the ceo
mels/005627.pt|at all since then and he came to me and i don't i
mels/026646.pt|we fall in october november they began the discussions of this bio it's actually a
mels/027303.pt|and philosophy is that challenging provides reward the fact that you overcame the challenge makes it that much more rewarding when you do and i think
mels/002706.pt|okay here's an idea here's a catch here's
mels/002683.pt|there should be a walk away clause if if you're already adding up the money
mels/025841.pt|blizzard partnered for their movie they
mels/019031.pt|was a bridge too far for a lot of people
mels/027048.pt|it'd be excited for this show
mels/006394.pt|giving them the the fan resurgence they're hoping to get but maybe it'll make them a lot of money and they do need that as well
mels/032085.pt|robin why would you ever upload that
mels/016243.pt|and that of course is lebron james thank you to
mels/009747.pt|that will be stupid enough because like there's no
mels/010807.pt|we're like you have to watch more bs2
mels/008595.pt|that he acknowledges everything that he's getting
mels/031733.pt|as ever seen those ai generated animes and
mels/017942.pt|well programs yeah lots of programs is an
mels/026319.pt|first introduction to the product would be on
mels/002879.pt|i was going to pay for this this difference so what's interesting though and what's very very interesting
mels/003155.pt|the dark knight apple is the joker apple is also a bad guy here who is tracking users and creating their own ad network they found out by calling it privacy they can just steal all the money that facebook was making every other app requires
mels/024840.pt|it's a new champion that champion generally is
mels/008849.pt|the what do you mean could he still pursue
mels/011357.pt|to see what happens yeah he
mels/026933.pt|if the market everyone wants to buy
mels/024874.pt|a study or a survey and they they asked them
mels/010713.pt|you know what i'm saying even if you
mels/000996.pt|i think that's a terrible idea well hear
mels/024052.pt|the question being what is only fans and in fact their site traffic their site traffic is now at all time highs during a time when overall internet traffic is down like point five percent
mels/030841.pt|the spartans very cool do any of your co-workers know me
mels/013016.pt|it would just be in cohorts you'd have some group of people doing
mels/001599.pt|i mean people who else shake drizzle lyrics editor
mels/028380.pt|a busy so what you say is i'm really limited on
mels/009101.pt|well that's that's true but that's only because i think you really get more of the the nuance of a video if you're not distracted by the the
mels/011194.pt|no take away my diploma they can't i don't think i don't think so either
mels/020841.pt|is the ninja of the youth today's marketing

mels/018351.pt|i'm not giving you stock in hrock for
mels/020043.pt|i think he was interesting was that they said um
mels/018563.pt|right as some of the greatest
mels/001310.pt|i know charlie reacted to it about how um
mels/009348.pt|we'll do it i kind of discord him about it

mels/016016.pt|don't have to worry about is that um

mels/025796.pt|one hundred percent and the audience scores 99
mels/002166.pt|are not have a list of jokes ready at your
mels/027102.pt|for hundreds of years and eventually the whole damn roman empire collapsed and then this guy tries to get
mels/006914.pt|an addictive substance it should be classified i think if i started smoking and i started playing balloons at the
mels/019184.pt|it starts taking off oh my God oh my God
mels/025895.pt|like a youtuber apology it's it's like nobody
mels/001661.pt|i just thought cats were lame until
mels/027830.pt|you sell it for way more than it costs to make it's a decent business but the problem is their margin is going down
mels/025039.pt|is julius it's not good quacks twitter
mels/001615.pt|literally the only vegetables i've eaten
mels/025313.pt|and if you've made any money off
mels/004609.pt|this whole chart and talk about it all
mels/026757.pt|by sony now the second thing they have to do is this announce their competitor to
mels/009019.pt|year ago but it was a big
mels/001254.pt|skill set and people would pay a lot for
mels/023194.pt|add some grass when they were small and now they're in like this factory problem but
mels/027713.pt|was barbie i always thought it was Barbie I always thought it
mels/007554.pt|and he's like you that's how
mels/021363.pt|in the last week and yes i did and what i gained was
mels/022146.pt|that's it marketing monday silence brand drake's if you enjoyed if you enjoyed
mels/031157.pt|were exercised you know like watch anime till
mels/017815.pt|of explain a good way to think i've made one these for nvidia i literally have thought about this ad nvidia is not a this is not something i don't use i think it's of explain a good way to think i've made one of these for nvidia i literally have thought about this at nvidia this is not
mels/025832.pt|or arcane success there's just no way this is the world of warcraft movie you'll notice not quite as beloved and this came out first like blizzard had the idea
mels/025989.pt|well the new year with some with an ode to eating ass yeah anyway i just thought that was a you know we're going to kick of the year off right with some terrible brand well of the new year with some with an ode to eating ass anyway i just thought that was a you
mels/025137.pt|we need to follow that up with a dub this is a well earned dub to jif peanut butter i was now people
mels/017132.pt|if the thank you for the two months
mels/005988.pt|im a value it's not super fun to watch planking but it's also
mels/001850.pt|and i don't know if they have it or if
mels/017976.pt|week that the supreme court is
mels/028954.pt|i mean i had a great time but again i
mels/002734.pt|done nothing of value there is people who have made brilliant songs from my stream that
mels/028046.pt|it was the first one to make any progress against the monolith that is amazon and amazon immediately fired back amazon went and fired every single senior manager who worked at that warehouse for losing the battle to the
mels/021567.pt|and what what's different about canadian brokers anyone else
mels/013957.pt|they will give you as much money as possible and lock you
mels/017364.pt|to do plug in a phone charger about halfway into a wall outlet then touch a penny to the exposed prongs amazon said it
mels/010208.pt|i was in the shower and i was like i don't think i can handle
mels/028209.pt|to uh to make it happen yeah bobby bobby
mels/030398.pt|i never sounded more dead serious in my
mels/031218.pt|i thought it was stupid and not taking the thing seriously enough you know the teachers weren't exactly like rock solid ride or die with me they were
mels/026191.pt|and i would have given him a win but unfortunately when things do well in the gaming industry
mels/011428.pt|it's tough for me to judge an editing resume
mels/003390.pt|it's the machines i would actually watch the movie where
mels/007711.pt|that's crazy way to phrase it but i get it if i could reverse men in black a language and just get it in my brain i mean spanish because then
mels/030858.pt|great great well hey when you're my boss
mels/018443.pt|i think i've explained a lot gonna talk about one per person the elephant in the i think i've explained a lot i'm gonna talk about one more person
mels/019551.pt|this has no business being this good i i i can't believe what what made this guy do this he doesn't even it's only one brand
mels/010073.pt|two months ago i just kept buying it i kept using it but obviously i didn't talk about it on stream because i didn't want
mels/003271.pt|so let me get you an actual
mels/015570.pt|of roku and you can watch netflix or anything you want and also roque has
mels/017911.pt|versus other movies okay generally the way a movie works they have some sort of hype trailer they get
mels/011818.pt|obviously not everybody they're talking to
mels/032271.pt|if the table he's literally teleconferencing gambling a thousand dollars on
mels/001199.pt|one is eight factor i would be very very very
mels/005790.pt|i go to the bathroom go out then
mels/027818.pt|where stocks don't always go up people are kind of under the impression that stocks always go up that's not true at all
mels/028978.pt|i started eating and i survived not a week a week would actually kill you i survived three days off of water from the tap the sink in my room and and candy and i have never felt more terrible than day three again
mels/024872.pt|in a previous marketing monday actually we're
mels/010039.pt|at it i've said it i've seen
mels/024737.pt|triple a game that took a studio hundreds of millions
mels/008033.pt|i want to be playing as much as i can
mels/008791.pt|more likely is a big billion multi-billion
mels/001394.pt|i said what i said he just repeated the
mels/012519.pt|that's my guess but for now at this price i'd probably say i'd probably say save your money unless you're a huge star wars fan or you're a huge theater
mels/008639.pt|is that means any time the richer party
mels/003927.pt|the third party people i mean this
mels/018967.pt|too much pressure for a zoomer even if it's only for 10 minutes
mels/002278.pt|and then you come back dude you're
mels/001926.pt|so like the balance of uh
mels/029969.pt|it's not true he said till the
mels/019302.pt|at the group project i haven't spoken to him in probably
mels/024350.pt|now our last beer ad by
mels/012212.pt|i go to the finals the the top four the
mels/014152.pt|more and more competitive there's more
mels/008483.pt|i must send you to brazil i want
mels/022699.pt|well ads don't really want to be next to
mels/025256.pt|keegan michael key as toad here's a clip
mels/022854.pt|tom was going to the moon he said
mels/018744.pt|in proven true was that no one wants to spend
mels/014142.pt|the ship and take their audience with them
mels/019754.pt|week for this topic i think we all know why cyberpunk
mels/013049.pt|i did lesson plan that helps the bad teachers
mels/024732.pt|a tough day but we made it
mels/026296.pt|for a good value et cetera
mels/023414.pt|after that you cheated because now that i've done it i have now become a difficulty andy so first of all there's no way you could have done it because i did it
mels/000616.pt|yeah we have to operation money launder
mels/005453.pt|i have the same jacket it's nice yeah
mels/030362.pt|i also want to say is nobody leaked which i really appreciate from
mels/017372.pt|thank god they finally got a dub for once the marvel cinematic universe if anyone needed a
mels/024442.pt|jumping out you know what i'm saying
mels/006076.pt|it's kind of i could still do
mels/022136.pt|i once was working late on one of these emails and i had to write the emails
mels/025475.pt|what the few years ago when there was the rise of that do you guys remember that fortnite based mouse company final mouse
mels/007535.pt|oh it makes me want to vomit
mels/010464.pt|and said he's down to join your squad that's the thing though i'm kind of on an
mels/018225.pt|when they um glom onto something that's
mels/012227.pt|then i cough and then i check my
mels/002880.pt|the world of business is that he may be in a situation where he needs to pump the share price of a company that he doesn't want to buy in order to reduce the amount of money he asked to pay we could very well be in a situation where you and musk needs to start tweeting positive in the world of business is that he may be in a situation where he needs to pump the share price of a company that he doesn't want to buy
mels/018753.pt|and so all those previous theories were like totally wrong and it turns out everyone's fine paying absurd amounts of money for the phone as long as they can flex on their
mels/011303.pt|okay what'd you say i have
mels/003392.pt|end of the day you guys are taking the robot side
mels/004143.pt|because it turns out turns out
mels/032189.pt|if my profits and i bet it all on the
mels/010290.pt|get her on the team um if
mels/023012.pt|with secret code that would only trigger at a later date so when it got reviewed by
mels/024683.pt|what i am worried about is if this does continue for
mels/027817.pt|we should i buy the dip a lot of people who have been investing in the past let's say 10 years have never seen a market
mels/008309.pt|i don't take too much time because
mels/014372.pt|it drops are a great way to drive attention viewership interest in a game
mels/008191.pt|i just did it for no out of nowhere and i got the whole minions overlay filter and i got the these custom minions alerts yeah no this was
mels/027004.pt|very clever ad and and i think bold and
mels/030384.pt|i original plan uh i really
mels/016324.pt|around st patrick's day and it actually worked sales did quite well and then unfortunately the guy playing him went to philly in the costume and said that he supported the ira and that british soldiers were better dead than alive
mels/025017.pt|is negative and it's a guy i guess
mels/012357.pt|like an escape pod which is just the back of
mels/011178.pt|like stream is one thing but if you're
mels/026483.pt|unfortunately what they did not understand is that buying a book does not give you the rights to the intellectual property i have purchased all
mels/012756.pt|you know what i'm saying like the to put in that much time and be
mels/019117.pt|is available followed in two days by the
mels/022961.pt|and then this is what they made off
mels/020570.pt|the marketing monday cdpr godspeed dude and i
mels/024501.pt|in stronger and more powerful with better lawyers and they won and if
mels/006689.pt|if i had hair like this i'd never wear a
mels/007379.pt|like that was the easiest way to know mango being
mels/026322.pt|it's to make these luxury nice high-end
mels/020581.pt|if you bought it on pc you're already way better off
mels/019512.pt|i think that's easy the five dollar footlong ad
mels/028659.pt|i go to michael's i go to michael's and
mels/005458.pt|this one i did look a little drunk i won't be honest with you i wasn't even drunk but
mels/029026.pt|so i was in a parking lot of a movie theater and my friend and i my friend by the
mels/029918.pt|was the first time it was like we i remember standing at that gas station pumping gas
mels/019637.pt|if you're on twitch we got a
mels/025644.pt|and i've also been critical of nintendo for being way way way too lawsuit happy
mels/020547.pt|to where they could have been so they have to do two big
mels/014889.pt|it'd be just incredibly close because they're
mels/023110.pt|the one i want to talk about the most the most sneaky is for a long long long time we just didn't give a
mels/017659.pt|the the renewed focus on packaging apple has an entire division devoted just to
mels/031915.pt|it it like expanded into like a little
mels/022050.pt|i'm gonna go through a lot of the ways
mels/021136.pt|it's the one woman in the ad what
mels/027298.pt|if people don't watch the same shows anymore
mels/019765.pt|it's always better than under hype
mels/024776.pt|that is a quote once you break that wall you break them
mels/030862.pt|i'm currently in the trenches of world war ii and need air support
mels/008704.pt|was like we all know there's bots on twitter because we see them occasionally
mels/029731.pt|here's my here's my if i could have magic wand
mels/020868.pt|what the people which is okay
mels/020509.pt|into the biggest launch of all time let's say they offer a new game let's say their next
mels/017326.pt|what of political power is the main thing that's
mels/029476.pt|but i met him at a convention and
mels/029571.pt|stuff you know it's like but back then it really was true and
mels/022712.pt|now if you're wondering who these people are
mels/001908.pt|we'll go to jacob wolfe on twitter
mels/021722.pt|ak system is so complicated it's complicated because of you
mels/003094.pt|but unfortunately the rising cost of all goods fuel energy rent housing and the stagnation of wages is causing more people to feel financially insecure than ever before which is going to have major political consequences during the midterms and could be destabilizing not only for our country but for a lot of countries around the globe
mels/030479.pt|i was little nervous and my first plan was
mels/007338.pt|it up getting the 30 himself
mels/031412.pt|we got out but it was refreshing was there any shrinkage first of all even if there was
mels/008786.pt|so now the court if they actually went through with it would have to force not only
mels/003263.pt|let's check it out i'm writing a book maybe you can invest
mels/016118.pt|i can't even play aoe dude
mels/014356.pt|but they haven't done it well but if someone comes along there's the
mels/029319.pt|for what this is like i'm like a
mels/022874.pt|the arguments done over zoom children found the
mels/028930.pt|up the next day and it's weird because i feel good i don't have a hangover i wake up the next day i think it's the morning it's actually
mels/015573.pt|if the time when um vaccines
mels/009411.pt|during his own top lane climb
mels/027322.pt|create a sense of scarcity so for example if you look at the steam charts so if i were to pull up the steam achievements for a game like sekiro you might notice only
mels/006497.pt|which is going to be the exact same thing as karna and
mels/021803.pt|you know what i was gonna
mels/025688.pt|yeah peter dill the vp of marketing peter dill weed more like it peter dill the vp of marketing for sony
mels/028055.pt|i mean something to you but it meant something to me okay after
mels/020826.pt|if the proper chuffed takes a lot out of
mels/007980.pt|wait you guys are gonna think this
mels/024611.pt|and i believe a 1 000
mels/026323.pt|the extremely beautiful touch points for the first time you get to interact and touch a new apple
mels/002823.pt|after week lately sex life uh
mels/005639.pt|it was totally fun had a good time um we
mels/019043.pt|but the truth is the truth that is enabling this is that the nature of celebrity has changed with social media and the fact
mels/018606.pt|ever ever guaranteed will you be able to buy a disk copy
mels/019068.pt|all this stuff i get a little
mels/013556.pt|it did real well i'm very
mels/023927.pt|he could he's using his face he
mels/014726.pt|that's it no that wasn't it wasn't spot on
mels/002672.pt|we have different preferences and different tastes but at the end of the day
mels/018484.pt|true you guys are right there they are worth quite a bit but nvidia's not that far behind you we're top
mels/003997.pt|it's a very busy lately with the nvidia stuff but i
mels/006346.pt|and that is tag yourself welcome to marketing monday on a wednesday
mels/000723.pt|ways forever and i've always like i've looked up to
mels/006989.pt|i understand that it was a fantastic event
mels/007261.pt|well he said some really nice things and okay right after the tournament's over like
mels/014008.pt|not cool neon colors on the arms and back and
mels/005463.pt|i don't know why everyone took these
mels/020241.pt|oh no please ignore that ignore that
mels/016001.pt|to raise prices what's stopping every other company from going massively into debt to do the same thing is that your question they kind of
mels/025319.pt|some other idiot in a neverending
mels/017926.pt|watch one because you want to see more about
mels/020439.pt|it's just obvious they couldn't even get him in the studio it's a one tank jake first take
mels/026048.pt|if they create jobs for it's
mels/014709.pt|your name's daniel day jewish why
mels/026404.pt|but or packaging this focus vastly increased market share and
mels/028578.pt|it was like an hour or your
mels/031377.pt|bougie and if that were it i would say okay he's making money but you know
mels/000753.pt|more with those guys um but it was a good
mels/031204.pt|i can't wait for the zoomer streamers to just start
mels/031836.pt|them from a video for a while they're really good i mean like they got a lot of victory royales i don't
mels/028697.pt|i basically lived out of my car i go to every esports event in california i
mels/009274.pt|what the hell is this are these in-stream ads i have twitch prime or i have
mels/028690.pt|which would get big in america and i always wanted to be part of it that's why i studied marketing in school that's why i studied abroad in korea my dad who's a
mels/032132.pt|will regale you with it was
mels/014453.pt|blast copyrighted music and you're not going to
mels/010172.pt|i think unless you really felt pain with pepper spray in your eyes like you
mels/012207.pt|maybe even younger he's probably like
mels/003004.pt|what we have to go like she can see something and then when she does that everyone it was like a pin drop everyone sees her and they freak out they fr right
mels/010247.pt|dick peppering game but it's kind of like um
mels/017408.pt|they couldn't even get an image of me they just found a different white guy
mels/023096.pt|together in there and there's no way of untangling it and so when we think we're only isolating based on taste we're really using a variety of things
mels/008383.pt|when all with twitter and elon
mels/010726.pt|milk tax fraud yeah there's no rule on tax
mels/029737.pt|now there's a void what am i gonna
mels/017597.pt|but i want to talk about the ones that apple is focused on apple has completely
mels/003519.pt|i don't see anything as um existential
mels/024621.pt|well goods that we all just tacitly consider to be just as valuable if not more so than physical goods and fashion in the digital realm for our digital avatars is going to be where they make a majority of their money long story short if you don't have fortnite
mels/017255.pt|the billions of dollars without actually
mels/000118.pt|in your life that's a great question i used to have like one of those confucius style beards and it went all the way down and i would ponder the mysteries of the
mels/021705.pt|someone who finds babies cute this is a pretty
mels/010103.pt|so it's easy recommendation for me check them
mels/014355.pt|does get their own live everyone's made their own
mels/031744.pt|waiting on the mouse okay gliss lord master
mels/004946.pt|it's right there's too many bots the contract is no one void
mels/004473.pt|you know that's what i'll say is
mels/018499.pt|microsoft having a beef with someone and going and buying a car that's about as much the other person makes in a year yeah they make about
mels/028973.pt|at the time it was all different kinds of horrible candy it was just this big brown package full of horrible candy which normally would be the
mels/015629.pt|they just don't have the heft they don't
mels/031426.pt|we were cursing a lot and
mels/021482.pt|the the shorts out of 70 billion dollars
mels/003863.pt|if he didn't do that i think he could have a better chance of getting
mels/020871.pt|i'm gonna try to explain it really simple
mels/005071.pt|values and judgment for normal people
mels/025680.pt|add something that makes you afraid these are my these are the prime ones my
mels/019656.pt|well that he works there also but okay
mels/003110.pt|in the comments results may be paid for
mels/020113.pt|in conclusion the number one acquisition of all time apple acquires next getting steve jobs and a better ios and that my friends i believe well argued well accurate are the
mels/011598.pt|anyway so that's my only gripe is that i kind of wish they had just like faded in the color
mels/029814.pt|or legacy or something like that and i
mels/032383.pt|look at the ghost move dude
mels/029163.pt|i could get like past erica but
mels/023351.pt|the fail is our good friends at
mels/023049.pt|it's probably going to happen here is epic
mels/023386.pt|the the a better version there is no real version of
mels/004590.pt|i really enjoyed it had a good time
mels/008227.pt|into recession this is the best case scenario by
mels/010768.pt|it's like the more they feed into the hivemind of
mels/006977.pt|i sincerely heard about but my number is in that range and it's never been like that ever in my life the thing about streaming is that
mels/031566.pt|at spot you can't keep me out he sets up
mels/018476.pt|it's himself watched my last marketing monday
mels/018870.pt|i'm coming around these memes suck but I get
mels/012379.pt|so that was done we go
mels/008540.pt|we're likely is that they want to return things to how they were before elon musk started talking about twitter they're
mels/014985.pt|and look at all the strategies
mels/022111.pt|was about the recent trend has been to be really really personified to try and
mels/009549.pt|in casual play like this every band changes the outcome of a match so much because you can just ruin
mels/003257.pt|and turn it into profit and what i love is the idea that a book that's already been scouted and published and is on
mels/007356.pt|it would always play chic and then like switch whenever it got hard and he'd
mels/022956.pt|battle passes and skins so epic games is a lot of things they run unreal engine they did fortnite they have the epic game store they have rocket league
mels/000950.pt|and then i find out my bachelor party is this weekend and i have to like
mels/022979.pt|drug sniffing dog is no one reviewing these
mels/022685.pt|poor not just the memes but a lot of porn
mels/024941.pt|it seems like melee games like cs cs 1.6 themed
mels/025712.pt|is everyone dressing up as a clown which is ronald mcdonald's thing
mels/031097.pt|if the people's revenue charts i know how much
mels/002837.pt|the court date in february and they wanted it in august the court has responded with a basically a
mels/022925.pt|basically what that means is we're not making money off this if we go
mels/027599.pt|and probably drafted up some bangers in the past year
mels/024149.pt|in that time was kind of the worst time to blow up if you wanted to get a big deal so it kind of felt bad for someone like i
mels/018528.pt|i come out on any other pass service
mels/022327.pt|one of the things i learned from this is about earned media whenever you make a like if you are a brand and you do something on your own social media it's called owned if it's big enough and
mels/030462.pt|not that follow this but this
mels/014487.pt|get fooled by a sales pitch so anyway we'll see so
mels/014003.pt|about some more failed business hats blockbusters lawyers
mels/011468.pt|update um i didn't get it but someone
mels/003188.pt|at a speech where he talked to all
mels/014329.pt|a very smart man at netflix who is now the ceo reed hastings
mels/014377.pt|the way it feels the way it looks
mels/026005.pt|the billions of dollars without actually
mels/013371.pt|some terrible tweets and some great ones and
mels/028128.pt|at way you can skip all the red tape and instantly go public and that was
mels/003821.pt|ten years is i i think there's
mels/016477.pt|that will launch me in the rest of the
mels/019771.pt|which means they often will buy it so the
mels/024589.pt|that was going on throughout the entire app over his epic trial and that was the trial to determine whether or not this character could appear naked and i guess what peely can
mels/014700.pt|bunch of weird stuff in it
mels/023500.pt|in the modern day economy are using the
mels/004305.pt|why is your mic just dangling there
mels/013401.pt|father when can i leave to be
mels/015746.pt|the shady about it they have to start saying like well
mels/016074.pt|that means and use a social media branch approach what so my first case study is
mels/018956.pt|the flaw of quibby here's the fundamental
mels/019972.pt|pixar movies now make about a billion dollars a year but the rough estimate is that for every billion dollars you make at a box office at disney you're making two times that on merchant theme parks there's there's more money in the toys so they make about three billion dollars per movie
mels/001259.pt|wife so i'll definitely check it out but i
mels/013714.pt|it'd be a dangerous precedent but i'm going
mels/018902.pt|the billions of dollars of investor money and we'll make a bunch of
mels/024538.pt|one thing that may cause them a lot of money down the road the judge did say that looking at all of the
mels/013796.pt|it's the robot uprising in five years when tesla's self-driving cars go to war with the rest of us rats with guns on exercise balls is the
mels/012688.pt|with both hands begging for escapism
mels/026455.pt|i keep rewards your faith often with high impact high value sets it's one of the reasons i believe
mels/027325.pt|about a previous marketing mondays scarcity
mels/028350.pt|in front of his son in
mels/007522.pt|it was truly a once in a lifetime encounter that was
mels/023575.pt|probably right up here and they priced it way down here
mels/011576.pt|but this is the real star
mels/009770.pt|it's about learning today's about expanding our
mels/018291.pt|i sent me this book and it was written by the guy who started this company
mels/006970.pt|if you want to link me i'll look at it
mels/019576.pt|the wouldn't be fair cause that chocolate
mels/001812.pt|i didn't want my co-workers to think
mels/002573.pt|there's only one way to do this we got
mels/015834.pt|just keep growing cable news the average age of a fox news viewer is
mels/002384.pt|to play brand new hitman content for the
mels/000119.pt|in the world with it but i it was that was about
mels/016999.pt|you know what reading's kind of like
mels/021205.pt|will lose there was a lot of talk in
mels/026414.pt|it's funny because car companies are so stuck in this
mels/014766.pt|you guys could be saved i personally
mels/006726.pt|by the way of my dog i don't know the breed
mels/008700.pt|that they knew it was higher and then
mels/008855.pt|are you could probably make a mint
mels/006001.pt|at josh mann was like i told him this i
mels/030310.pt|okay because i was equal to the best man in
mels/031773.pt|but if there's ever a day you know that i could contribute a little bit of the lore maybe i
mels/032279.pt|one last try everyone rejoins as we walk through
mels/029154.pt|the battery dies i've saved hundreds times to be sure
mels/003748.pt|yeah that they're scared they're scared
mels/004050.pt|if streams congrats now remember once you make money streaming a lot of what i'm
mels/003234.pt|get earn anything they turned a web three game into a
mels/003986.pt|not nearly bald enough boy guy party in the
mels/008210.pt|if you don't think it's cringe then i i
mels/010926.pt|with minions rise of group for the minions pizza challenge and my understanding is that if you go to
mels/010415.pt|three choices but they're all terrible i know but i looked at the internet speeds in
mels/017162.pt|like okay we'll do another run even though they weren't gonna because of the copyright on the hat
mels/005706.pt|it was really fun we had it
mels/008451.pt|you played basketball with no hands that's bold that's a ball take
mels/027730.pt|oh I'm getting back to dropping in on
mels/030799.pt|it's opened up at nvidia want to start
mels/019904.pt|a time to don't do don't have the don't don't don't do don doted on the don't do don't do that the what is the most overhapped game of all
mels/023186.pt|holy moly despite being you know a youthful gen z burger he
mels/020620.pt|yeah right here i love it fortnite baby and now
mels/021562.pt|there are short positions don't unwind
mels/004124.pt|if the share something on social media
mels/014396.pt|so that that this is one thing that
mels/028816.pt|and i was barely above what i was making but also i have almost no expenses and let me be clear the twitch office in that first year
mels/003244.pt|in books the answer is yes what if you could own a stake in harry potter what if a book series functioned like a
mels/022108.pt|adidas jerseys that say terrible things about the holocaust
mels/030587.pt|france obviously how do you answer how do you answer i haven't played
mels/025640.pt|it's was hard to categorize as
mels/001027.pt|i'll give you that speaking of tabs this one's about a hyundai plant in alabama where there was
mels/031057.pt|i remember when i first met ludwig he was an editor for scar and
mels/015520.pt|one show the morning show on apple tv
mels/017696.pt|a lot of money on a product uh the fact they felt
mels/016817.pt|if the thing over the past 15 to 20
mels/031952.pt|if the people didn't believe me
mels/000724.pt|it's very sweet very very kind
mels/025004.pt|quote unquote bring a bunch of jobs to america and then made a bunch of essentially fake factories and empty they bought a bunch of office buildings and filled them with like four employees just to fill the exact
mels/006120.pt|well yeah so if you don't know the other
mels/027304.pt|wigan the perfect example of that because i spent seven hours in the tree sentinel and had the best moment of my life
mels/025031.pt|in atlanta when i was trying to steal the orange julius wi-fi in that mall
mels/020845.pt|that's all i'm trying to do so this is a thread by nick
mels/018227.pt|they they threw in this at the end but
mels/022578.pt|i actually too far what if they banned everyone
mels/028022.pt|the state of the union on unions uh
mels/009752.pt|takes it out has it put onto his face
mels/027471.pt|i encourage you to contact your local representatives and ask them that
mels/005319.pt|we're definitely gonna do it and the dream blunt rotation
mels/016441.pt|people that need to pay for gas as it rises and as the
mels/016285.pt|hold them accountable isn't this kind of
mels/016339.pt|now that's that's three dubs but he's never had a
mels/003249.pt|except for anything less than millions so it
mels/025894.pt|if the the court most people in my experience don't give much amount of weight to your words they don't every time something
mels/004287.pt|and i think you have it
mels/022547.pt|i just want you to know that i haven't seen uh i haven't seen
mels/015894.pt|i think i showed it on the one i think i showed it on this one of these slides look even this
mels/020984.pt|market research firm and you can if you pay for the description which i do you can see they do
mels/020834.pt|and that my friends is the end of the marketing monday awards i hope you enjoyed
mels/001668.pt|yeah i've been seeing so much interesting things on youtube that i've been avoiding watching so i can watch it with you guys
mels/025648.pt|something's evil about it this might be the most evil like in one headline since like world war
mels/007137.pt|oh yeah and it's like all right fine you know what
mels/026863.pt|whenever they have that they have that um
mels/001358.pt|and i did say kill on site and
mels/006386.pt|when they put out this commercial
mels/016542.pt|all the supporting parts of it
mels/008384.pt|just maybe a minimal version of that because twitter launched his lawsuit
mels/027923.pt|with the that mark zuckerberg carefully ignored in order to get his engineers working on an nft solution for instagram really
mels/026960.pt|are you ready the meta quest
mels/028600.pt|so i was pretty good at
mels/029729.pt|they talked about kings of california they didn't
mels/031922.pt|one pitched in but we were in this area we were in like the the
mels/008827.pt|elon musk is mostly known as like he's a smart
mels/009524.pt|so squishy and so slow she dies so easy the thing that new players mess up at league is not pressing the buttons there's only four
mels/017225.pt|the brand's account shot back ask your mom but the guy was completely not
mels/006876.pt|we just expenses to twitch early twitch had the
mels/027880.pt|if the for cheap you can start investing and
mels/020630.pt|in this ad at one point a tweet ratioed them that
mels/001233.pt|maybe i mentioned the pancakes and they
mels/014392.pt|than anyone can swap over and keep their
mels/016736.pt|from the first one i had back in
mels/024576.pt|it's because at the end of this all even though
mels/026415.pt|car companies will run ads just to prevent buyers remorse from their own consumers
mels/007037.pt|well for yourself check out max w
mels/001472.pt|trudeau was the easy one i i figured
mels/013717.pt|somebody says slurs in chat somebody
mels/023294.pt|five billion dollars in value and of course everyone wrote four million articles about it oh my god oh my god it is a testament to the power of
mels/013213.pt|the perfect level of sadness a truck will never have smaller fingers i don't if i had smaller fingers
mels/018577.pt|because once you get locked into a subscription service you don't want to leave it once once you're on netflix for example you're hooked for life people are netflix forever they don't they don't leave once you're once you have your cloud gaming service that has all of your games forever you don't want to leave it it's like steam dude nobody wants to leave steam it could be
mels/006109.pt|this is the context this is the
mels/000409.pt|in the middle of one hand and i'm drunk and
mels/002645.pt|some someone the next person will win something you will be the house i will be the player this is how we're gonna
mels/015949.pt|if you look back after the end of the month and
mels/004506.pt|i just want to tell you one thing and that is happy
mels/018926.pt|we will guarantee it someone did an interview with meg whitman and asked what she watches
mels/014808.pt|i have only one major fail and it is the saga told entirely through kotaku articles of
mels/011288.pt|let me tell you it's going to be a little bit embarrassing when you lose on the first round but that's okay nope everyone
mels/017641.pt|verizon spends a lot of money here apple
mels/022589.pt|would drown it would be like it would
mels/004500.pt|yeah good i got a better idea
mels/002156.pt|you want a real theory fall guys okay just think about it big
mels/025294.pt|what my second theme on original content netflix has the bulk of it prime video number two with invincible and the boys number three disney plus apple tv hulu hbo max paramount plus and other which
mels/025682.pt|good in my mind but they're the ones that stuck out to me because they they
mels/006417.pt|and here to nicholas verk who dropped this
mels/010510.pt|well you wouldn't you wouldn't paint everyone
mels/015048.pt|the internet was getting faster and
mels/032356.pt|long for whatever reason is pathetic i have
mels/028033.pt|which of the profit it's good this is all
mels/021156.pt|it was a kid i'd really like it feels like it appeals to kids kids are the most likely to be
mels/024625.pt|to me because a few months ago we did an ad review where we watched the commercial berries and cream berries and
mels/027345.pt|this is not an isolated incident this is almost the core of what has given these things
mels/007054.pt|he was like head of music or something twitch music which
mels/024098.pt|going to do then taco bell checkmate uh that's
mels/003740.pt|well as bribery it's like company donates a few hundred thousand dollars to a politician and then suddenly they're doing things that are positive for that company
mels/016944.pt|itself before accepting sponsorship they also
mels/014279.pt|and so that that carries much more weight than just grabbing one off ninja
mels/025460.pt|it is my dream one day for all jobs be paid in gotcha mechanics i would love if
mels/013260.pt|i can't reveal it all i can say is you know what if
mels/028580.pt|oh that's the exact amount you just made
mels/027289.pt|get to the difficulty because when you think
mels/004570.pt|i'll talk about it but i mean we've
mels/001022.pt|you're lying you sent me a picture of four different
mels/023738.pt|it's not do that i look at their
mels/026056.pt|plug in a phone charger about halfway into a wall outlet then touch a penny to the exposed prongs amazon said it
mels/022947.pt|billion dollar company winning does not make them into a
mels/008027.pt|a great time of course as a kid but like there was a lot of flaws in it even even then and
mels/017298.pt|back in public domain also some other stuff
mels/008175.pt|i did and also i was paid in mousepads
mels/006369.pt|pay to win games uh blizzard has ever released by
mels/020148.pt|way to get a good amount of engagement features oreo in it it's kind of cheeky and funny this is
mels/026062.pt|it's been struggling the marvel cinematic universe if anyone needed
mels/032384.pt|just just take a look take a look at if i use descending dark once
mels/026905.pt|what works right now i think their agency
mels/015935.pt|thumbnail generation that makes you more likely to watch shows based on what else you've watched the thumbnails are tailored basically to what your preferences
mels/013269.pt|i've never heard anyone other than you right now say that
mels/031805.pt|wow well we finally got out of
mels/026497.pt|they spent the money on the book to inspire them to begin this wow good start another amazing crypto project in the books it's crazy to me that despite crypto being a thing for a couple
mels/022329.pt|news articles about someone else's brand but because
mels/016129.pt|i'll see you when i see you i might do a stream with my family around christmas i'll give you guys
mels/028103.pt|crazy insane levels of lockdowns across major cities the most impacted being shanghai and they are now starting to pay a serious price for it their economy is slowing rapidly because literally factories can't run trucks can't move everything is so shut down that it's actually causing a severe crunch so
mels/015422.pt|okay making disney a fearsome competitor you could in fact
mels/023603.pt|but you know the really sad part is that none of these workers
mels/000678.pt|we take a break we go to dinner uh
mels/018545.pt|are losing money on it so between those two things microsoft
mels/025504.pt|what do they do so anyway i feel like this is the truth for a lot of companies or
mels/016649.pt|the price of batteries has fallen exponentially similar to
mels/001596.pt|healthy and nutritious and tasty legitimately tasty meals that i really do enjoy and i've been eating for like
mels/029280.pt|oh yeah marketing mondays my my monday
mels/022794.pt|and they found out instantly like the second the deal was signed the housing market started really collapsing and they started realizing all
mels/018906.pt|because as you heard from that intro this was marketed at the younger generation the idea was that zoomers specifically
mels/024646.pt|was actually living in but on the books it was worth a lot of money a company like evergrand which is a real estate
mels/005255.pt|well the thing is nobody else in his group
mels/011459.pt|black thought released a album called cheat codes featuring the late mf doom
mels/008058.pt|thank you very much chat spam

mels/020696.pt|and it's so terrible it showed
mels/011287.pt|the new shows right yes or
mels/002982.pt|it's so genius no that was not the case
mels/020164.pt|if the come from a food brand on
mels/003933.pt|there was a third party candidate
mels/024782.pt|the idea of this is to have so many different currency types and tokens and weird denominations things are bought in to
mels/021647.pt|well it's a good little story so i think this
mels/026894.pt|all mexican avocado imports are banned that is that is a bummer i'm sorry
mels/022815.pt|cough tesla this is about what
mels/020088.pt|doing because he's a kid it starts doing
mels/005320.pt|but you know it's probably i mean it's almost certainly because it was uh a
mels/001628.pt|i'm pretty sure that's been like five ludwig titles anyway
mels/030320.pt|it traveled he never travels but he traveled to this event and
mels/031177.pt|we don't feel sorry for anyone with this much money but if ludwig had been this big two years earlier he would have made a hundred million
mels/002085.pt|and then you get thrown out of the church where you're getting married

mels/008909.pt|the a hold of me apparently has been going through my editor quack and they've been talking
mels/008971.pt|seem to hold no water the only one that holds any water is that in the contract that says
mels/004234.pt|stop to the moon but you know be careful cause
mels/017062.pt|there was a new twitch atlas that released as
mels/027091.pt|on the right okay really and the stock

mels/010395.pt|megabits download available wireless option it's good for
mels/027800.pt|if the everything bubble pops which is already doing we need to get scapegoat there's no scapegoat good enough and in history
mels/026093.pt|number two increased social media presence means doing things like going to a party and getting while drunk can severely embarrass you this was a big response from girls on a survey and
mels/030460.pt|so what i had done was and this is like i wanted to like
mels/031129.pt|or like shroud would like not care about content or tweets or
mels/015582.pt|what they're simple they're cheap and
mels/012813.pt|which is the the nationwide college league of legends

mels/001054.pt|yo bachelor boy enjoy your time thanks
mels/030866.pt|actually be dope because then i
mels/018600.pt|we'll probably have timed exclusive some multi-platform to keep up appearances and to get through the churn of things that are already being worked on that's probably
mels/025802.pt|we summarizes what the past few years have
mels/004520.pt|one questions that it's just like come on make
mels/018701.pt|what is worth a hundred and fifty
mels/005410.pt|amman exposure though because literally you say
mels/026760.pt|and this will be announced i think relatively soon
mels/029619.pt|and like he's just different he does not find himself by his record vs yes i said non don't do that is that and like he's just different yeah he does not define himself by his record verses
mels/012249.pt|walking around the ship there's always some stuff happening what was really cool was that the actors would talk to each other even if nobody was around i saw this on multiple occasions where you'd walk in and you could hear they stayed in character talking to each other so like you could seamlessly join a situation like like you'd walk into like around
mels/022355.pt|a number three that new customers could use code dsc atria on
mels/024004.pt|at smart they're not that dumb as to
mels/027637.pt|what he come from and it turns out the vast majority of this is debbie is taking out a lot of debt and i thought okay what's the interest payment on this day and it what he come from and it turns out the vast majority of this is debt he is taking out a lot of debt and i thought okay
mels/023945.pt|if the things that are controversial getting attention and then feeding off in a more creative way it's just uh it's just smart
mels/024684.pt|everything is going to go down even safe
mels/012083.pt|and so you started to see him over and
mels/023559.pt|the a gucci belt at like 100 bucks
mels/021105.pt|is are the pizza looking good that's what really matters

mels/022851.pt|he's doing now so i googled him i just
mels/025078.pt|the top five here and i think this is a more accurate way of determining

mels/014984.pt|at a factor in we are gonna dive
mels/030802.pt|second of all why would i carpool with
mels/023030.pt|what the fever is going around i'd like to stop to a second and i want to sue twitch
mels/016432.pt|as a prop to fleece average people and i think that should be your main focus if you're trying to try to
mels/013466.pt|thing to do oh my god what it's
mels/032393.pt|that was almost at the end and i stopped phase one down
mels/017877.pt|they have massive monopolies they they can charge whatever they want they don't advertise to get you excited about the product

mels/031213.pt|what the corporation keep that in mind it'll come in handy later i a young 17 year old

mels/001766.pt|to be a lovable hero so i don't know that it's only the meme we're talking about and it's funny because he was kind of a
mels/006883.pt|more than i am to be here bro to work for you it was crazy it was a it was it was it was wild it was not
mels/004918.pt|and so they basically uh they
mels/020763.pt|and of the year for marketing because he partnered with literally every goddamn brand on the planet travis scott travis scott started this year
mels/030363.pt|the chatters i had a photographer ready yeah i had a whole thing
mels/023688.pt|posted a tweet that asked the following what do you think is the best way to get around town and still do our part to protect the environments hashtag world environment day and it's a poll with four options
mels/008597.pt|in all that stuff so then he signs it
mels/029455.pt|sort of sit there i'm like all
mels/012473.pt|with the fireworks outside the fireworks in space
mels/012503.pt|is that made me a lot more than 5k
mels/003600.pt|i live in the bay right now i'm a cs major but it's tough getting interviews
mels/019792.pt|in the first day of this kickstarter it touched the nerve in the gaming
mels/021684.pt|and there's no flaws this is what this category was created for everyone in this commercial just needed
mels/008564.pt|and he hasn't been able to actually show any evidence that the number is
mels/027031.pt|or hard suit by the way showed up to the
mels/028144.pt|in revenue and then loses 80 million on
mels/013468.pt|tom holland zero dollars he was bullied in school for being a ballet dancer and also diagnosed
mels/004338.pt|is as funny as he might think

mels/012400.pt|a fire alarm like don't be scared that you're
mels/017800.pt|and subs even though his stream would not change in quality i think the
mels/022667.pt|i like of their best uh
mels/001741.pt|would win the bet if someone goes overboard he can win the bet so
mels/014442.pt|we can sort of talk more about ludwig or i can answer questions but that's what i wanted to bring up that's my that's
mels/026407.pt|or have and but i wanted to say this is
mels/017791.pt|you know emote cultural moments i don't
mels/010200.pt|water dripped down my pants or something or
mels/032254.pt|it's like and he flips over one card and it's
mels/023082.pt|as a year on graphics card that's what i would try to capture as a marketer let me compare that to how much the average person spends eating out this is the
mels/023988.pt|what it costs us okay i think a lot of the takes i saw
mels/023013.pt|it's amazing reviewers they didn't notice it and the secret code after a later date triggered and unlocked a new store this
mels/016634.pt|at present an opportunity in that and that is the cost of solar for example has dropped by a factor of
mels/021728.pt|if i could just go home and discuss things with my wife
mels/024073.pt|restaurant design basically the taco bank with like vastly vastly expanded
mels/005094.pt|and so today i've saved you the time
mels/005254.pt|and so okay that's fine and then
mels/014274.pt|going to continue to spend money and they're going to continue with their new
mels/017715.pt|or truck okay it's a product that doesn't need to pay for
mels/026245.pt|well then they would have because it just feels like you get none of the pain your brain is like wait no pain all gain at the moment i click
mels/011174.pt|because i just hang on my friends
mels/012725.pt|i lived in germany when runescape was big like when it was not
mels/022247.pt|well i don't even know if
mels/021958.pt|of a moat they call it so that's the idea is you do hard things that less people can do and you start to build this moat that
mels/003310.pt|it look at the data including labor market consumer
mels/025096.pt|people generally outside of i guess

mels/020734.pt|in awards these awards begin with the worst
mels/026556.pt|of course god gamer but they so far it has remained

mels/031203.pt|i was when we played this so i i'm very excited for all the
mels/006122.pt|the stream previously that he was gonna
mels/013068.pt|the guy who left his job at animation lead at nickelodeon because he got kids
mels/012998.pt|math month sounds hell but if you're someone that struggles with math instead
mels/019609.pt|for a marketing campaign what gets bumped to make room for i'm loving it which we all agree is
mels/005987.pt|at the game pops off he
mels/026996.pt|in dollar ad costing them tens of millions more because everyone that signed up
mels/017248.pt|fake a deep voice buy a bunch of
mels/009923.pt|flick the it's like it's like
mels/009951.pt|where are the explorer thank you for the six months alberto
mels/020363.pt|at any given moment is seemingly arbitrary the final nail in the coffin is the lack of any form of yellow tree topper to complete the picture two out of ten and that's generous
mels/027417.pt|the actual free version does not appear on google no matter what and so i give the
mels/029186.pt|democracy to the anarchists the mere inclusion of this mode was appalling
mels/005267.pt|she says that he didn't know who
mels/027908.pt|if you don't get more oceanfront than that you get the ocean right at your door again
mels/012248.pt|i go take a stroll together we're walking
mels/028373.pt|and whoever lasts the longest gets
mels/023100.pt|what are the main things they'll do is they will rename products that have been named the same way for thousands of years
mels/027419.pt|looking confused and wistful and forlorn which i thought was a great tweet and
mels/009205.pt|there are some games where you can kind of like play a little bit watch a little bit and get better starcraft's one of
mels/026135.pt|they got a twitter old head anyway we'll do a fail next that was a
mels/010044.pt|but i'm here today because the state of the world is so awful and i can't sit back and just be an actor anymore not with this incredible platform the
mels/002029.pt|this in the west at least a marginalized
mels/015923.pt|what do you think about how streaming services
mels/025028.pt|what about fast food on social media a lot there's not much you can debate on social media without people getting too mad and fast
mels/008333.pt|little time zone humor yeah we're going back we're going back
mels/000277.pt|big enough crew and he's like yeah i'm coming with a crew they're all youtubers
mels/030091.pt|it's like like because i maybe i could have waited
mels/021959.pt|eventually no one else can do what you can do i think the way to think about
mels/020460.pt|on points with the story a lot of games have been
mels/019814.pt|if only number eight is is
mels/026559.pt|was you can make so much money instantly or add a thing where you could pay a dollar to get a new puzzle on the same day i mean this guy could print money and he's choosing not to do it which is like an insane
mels/029803.pt|started going to tournaments i remember we went to one of the big ones for me
mels/020599.pt|growing up to the door right now who could it be yes it's
mels/013304.pt|answer to that question you'll know my answer no i
mels/008012.pt|i like it i checked the box i like it for
mels/016042.pt|i my setup so i'll probably still stream from arizona i'm thinking of doing a family stream real ones remember real ones know i did a family stream back in the day where may asked in my setup so i'll probably still stream from arizona i'm thinking of doing a family stream
mels/021668.pt|gotta love mountain dew they're trying to enter this contest so it's a clean aesthetic it shows the new flavor it's got john
mels/002932.pt|not one and it just it was kind of mid it
mels/001205.pt|i never wanted it again i like avoided it
mels/019331.pt|it's the computer systems these were the nerdiest kids in class and the most likely to be our competition you have to target certain markets so they made the markets the mercedes
mels/005561.pt|go through it and they were like um we
mels/020691.pt|of low key under the radar building an audience i
mels/008687.pt|who knows much more than me there's
mels/003082.pt|people are feeling it in their uh
mels/019622.pt|the badge yeah every four years
mels/027024.pt|hell yeah brother god damn it
mels/001326.pt|it's impressive but it's not like i
mels/025803.pt|it felt like where it's all slipping more towards riot and away from blizzard and i found this quora thread from
mels/020346.pt|a five i think four or five i mean look if it's not a five it's only because
mels/023989.pt|all these guys are stupid they don't know that only that
mels/008871.pt|i for that amount of money and all the shareholders
mels/008255.pt|and started his own company called juked
mels/027649.pt|but i will no longer be after he's going to pay me if
mels/003049.pt|amc has not answered so i'm shorting amc
mels/014145.pt|and if you happen to blow up in that era like if you happen to be let's say it's like late
mels/000453.pt|if the front of me tons of and i'm just like i need a
mels/006434.pt|of sorrow he has a 5
mels/018693.pt|for all eternity microsoft is worth
mels/031667.pt|but you know it's like i'm walking around
mels/001948.pt|a little more time like if i just
mels/001416.pt|let's get blocky milwaukee welcome wacky yo let's get blocky blocky welcome
mels/013276.pt|but it is dope and it is progress because people like to watch things that way
mels/022401.pt|do the next one number three
mels/022826.pt|some of the cash flow of
mels/012404.pt|first order members to rise up like
mels/024912.pt|games that apply over 100 plus roles or 90
mels/022611.pt|if you've ever seen before gamers
mels/021739.pt|we cringe into one that's like in on the joke but
mels/018022.pt|so let me show you for the last part of the stream in honor of in-game advertising good and
mels/023391.pt|and motivation for marketing yeah of course bro when i was working at twitch and i
mels/022686.pt|so when she bought the company for
mels/025392.pt|making fun of it again but then i thought about it again on a third level
mels/002015.pt|if the balls and then i in conversation
mels/020073.pt|and social twitch was also bought for one billion dollars around the same time two companies made acquisitions okay
mels/015753.pt|or i could spend eight bucks subscribe to the streaming service watch it all and
mels/028895.pt|student events how did you not vomit oh i
mels/003070.pt|i got a problem for you guys
mels/026814.pt|and they made this massive pivot to the metaverse and if we're being honest is is a buzzword right now it's a joke it doesn't exist nobody's using a vr headset to go talk to their their boys the
mels/030495.pt|it's very very picturesque very beautiful very nice night um she looks great
mels/024655.pt|because now mining companies that make metals and things that might be
mels/016945.pt|in fractional shares so if you don't want to buy
mels/009718.pt|i gotta get this off people uh
mels/027656.pt|this company around and massively increase
mels/006699.pt|they got six hours i mentioned
mels/000470.pt|need the blt and the second i lay down in the bed i
mels/029591.pt|one kind of what he needed to focus on and i was making this point i kind of realized this watching the
mels/015069.pt|they thought they could make a quick buck
mels/020176.pt|in the cucumber i'm sorry i know
mels/022843.pt|the next year not only do they lose all that money they have to do a write down of
mels/030105.pt|i was like i'm going to be
mels/007777.pt|what is it that by the way
mels/007691.pt|our streams and then only occasionally like today i'll stream for a few hours late at night but
mels/002233.pt|going to work it feels like it's like a big waste of time and money and the ceo would be you
mels/013991.pt|because it just feels like you get none of the pain your brain is like wait no pain all gain at the moment i click
mels/017931.pt|i would say like most things there's probably some things that are
mels/001491.pt|i gotta say though this seems a little
mels/029915.pt|at regionals and we were stopped at a gas station
mels/004490.pt|it's like you know it's like think about why shaq is likable you
mels/021857.pt|is the reason this all started to spike i'd like to point something out to you though this is whenever
mels/021067.pt|chocolate peanuts caramel peanut butter pretzels never heard of it where have you been under a rock new to me what were you born yesterday
mels/017238.pt|it created wet january which is all about like binge drinking in january to start the new year off right
mels/017196.pt|if any monday on time ever again

mels/001991.pt|you get a waffle maker it's pretty easy to make you have to
mels/007503.pt|of disgusting food and he like grabs his
mels/006319.pt|i love this elden ring takes video
mels/014276.pt|i think they could i mean they could
mels/028740.pt|the missing it so i respond and i go please please please please i even remember the guy's name
mels/017542.pt|i the corporation there is no company that has out valued apple at three
mels/020537.pt|they have a launch week and then they go so most games have to get
mels/004208.pt|today i want to let you know that i love your content so much and i can't wait to make
mels/007139.pt|and but then the thing about
mels/019264.pt|how did they lose one thing I've noticed
mels/002049.pt|i changed it to say that i'm not looking for someone who's living at home with their mother
mels/024614.pt|the main growth area for luxury bands in
mels/031269.pt|as this moment is happening right about here i pop off loudly i
mels/031587.pt|this is the last big match of starcraft ever
mels/012425.pt|with the i wanted to show you
mels/030923.pt|oh true story so when i was interviewing
mels/023138.pt|it was insurmountable so they changed to
mels/026078.pt|if any clip gets popular they will automatically write an article about it and and sort of farm it for clickbait
mels/005580.pt|if the pizzas cutie orders 50
mels/012891.pt|and i had a dorm room so i he was like an adult dude i was like
mels/008723.pt|no no no no no no it's materially
mels/006570.pt|went so well we know that after making trillions of dollars the first time the morbius and then definitely understanding that it wasn't just a big joke at their expense but truly a groundswell movement to support morbius to the top of the charts
mels/020876.pt|it's because of fires if you want to buy a house in california and get fire insurance it has gotten so expensive that most
mels/024132.pt|start this trend that everyone thinks they have to do like a video like they have to do like a sketch comedy thing for when they
mels/005356.pt|i don't know i listen i don't i barely even remember that interaction and so i'm not certain that he's going to be turning around and head dotting at me
mels/022742.pt|so that they bought motorola for 12 and
mels/007630.pt|when it comes to editing he did a fire fire job on
mels/019191.pt|copies when two companies are going
mels/006877.pt|the most egregious expenses across the company it was crazy dude people expense the wildest wildest
mels/010216.pt|going again what's your no what's the rest of
mels/024693.pt|food i can't wait to get in on the dip and you
mels/023528.pt|work they don't have to have so many employees they don't have to have so many factories the risk is lower as long as they keep the brand value high
mels/024613.pt|his brother that's the coolest kids in school bar
mels/011933.pt|this is the guy lieutenant croy this guy
mels/014479.pt|i thought but i just did both interviews i did tours of both areas and i was like you know what nvidia just seems a little more exciting like i i
mels/014728.pt|wait what the hell is this dude
mels/016605.pt|in the past year between 18 and 30.
mels/010887.pt|go and say stupid stuff but they they they have real like hustle culture type stuff and i
mels/007468.pt|we're at a place called original joe's which is
mels/007370.pt|they showed but like we were we were we were we were
mels/028664.pt|the hours late for work i don't go to my desk i don't go to a meeting i go to
mels/005603.pt|what about the miz history oh
mels/019492.pt|the thing which is a word i just coined right there
mels/011669.pt|from from when you're driving up to it
mels/014299.pt|and itself in this final stages of the war the major last ditch players who's going to come out on top and secure the majority market share add infinitum
mels/005810.pt|obviously he made a mistake obviously
mels/023170.pt|the trend for this has gotten so bad marketers basically noticed that if you add grill marks it sells better and so now often frozen food is delivered to grocery stores with grill marks painted on so when you buy this has never touched
mels/029167.pt|when they entered the department store to buy a water stone in order to get
mels/018084.pt|why would you make it so hard it's just
mels/032255.pt|it's really low it's like a two
mels/022953.pt|if they don't talk like this anymore
mels/009554.pt|i wasn't there in time but he can't
mels/010971.pt|right here let's see what we're getting into here
mels/022343.pt|well i think the talk about is
mels/014335.pt|streaming service for other people's content and they realized that the thing
mels/028725.pt|whites about league get a vip area for stable
mels/024783.pt|to make it so your brand
mels/002773.pt|extreme we've done in a very long time will be happening it'll be me
mels/031023.pt|i laugh he was like no no no no
mels/005170.pt|deep dirt under everyone she had
mels/020782.pt|and i looked at a lot of 'em was nike's you can't stop was at now their entire campaign was amazing you've probably and i looked at a lot of them was nike's you can't stop us ad now
mels/008785.pt|from banks that they've promised to give him
mels/000759.pt|oh yeah okay wait i had a video idea
mels/016260.pt|it has been used 10 out of the 43 losses
mels/009626.pt|you probably will if you watched my zero to hero
mels/027347.pt|we should call this all out as cringe
mels/007104.pt|watching a lot more youtube ever since i started streaming and when you watch a lot of youtube for your main media diet you are very prone to getting pushed into an obsession funnel because it snowballs you know what i'm saying if your media diet is
mels/021123.pt|it's funny because the executive that pitched this is the
mels/026395.pt|well saying dear iphone users please don't forget that a green bubble is a real person the green and blue bubble
mels/021178.pt|if the trend that i want to get into is that
mels/027773.pt|which actually brings us to our main story of the day
mels/008682.pt|then they say that will affect nothing and there's a lot of a lot of
mels/016618.pt|cliff almost over the entire world where
mels/005488.pt|my first thought was like wow i can't believe she talks like that for real because my brain didn't even connect the dots that it could possibly be related to my stream i can't believe someone actually says excuse me for real that's crazy
mels/025673.pt|without breaking social norms while the other one the shock value one often
mels/004773.pt|one thousand dollars a share but immediately after announcing this acquisition
mels/026389.pt|in new way of configuring the camera or
mels/006702.pt|though is that i cursed like a sailor i actually cursed like a sailor upon
mels/027235.pt|i don't care about pc graphics stability and performance apparently nor quest design really and you know coming from users
mels/030280.pt|i have two choices i can murder him
mels/027326.pt|it's probably one of the number one ways in the world in all of branding to create
mels/012523.pt|the eight hours or whatever more than that but but if you're not all in and i think i was i tried to be as
mels/005017.pt|i like this what if we all pigeon you guys with subscribers and i like this what if we all pitch in
mels/023123.pt|especially if they have a small package they'll just
mels/024263.pt|why did they go through all the effort
mels/006884.pt|in silicon valley's like the peak dude
mels/030784.pt|let's say it's true and i wrote every
mels/004013.pt|long time oh i used to be a league of
mels/026362.pt|tech support they were outsourcing tech
mels/028442.pt|the from school but you gotta come with me to work because i i'm not done yet
mels/019726.pt|there are personal choices you can make people always talk about
mels/011781.pt|for a hallway and they give us like a little bit of a safety video
mels/013899.pt|feeding you broccoli oh my god thank you i thought
mels/014720.pt|let's see what the clip is dude
mels/003884.pt|but you know i think i think
mels/019008.pt|imagine their appearance and so this is literally like a perfect fake woman that has no facial flaws and i saw
mels/018056.pt|if the situation please stay far away let the firemen do their job they do not need pepsi dude can't you give them something to help revive them pepsi
mels/013974.pt|i i want to make that clear because i've seen a lot of these companies start to blow up i've been watching their financials explode and if they're making that much money and they are getting invested that much that means
mels/021609.pt|i have analyzed and determined a special rating algorithm to determine which
mels/002961.pt|kind have spent more everyone's feeding for the
mels/030743.pt|good quiz good quiz so far good quiz so far
mels/011254.pt|was like cameras all over the house it was the worst day
mels/003060.pt|we were running out so we the
mels/024314.pt|it had a lot of problems with this line i
mels/013045.pt|is like by the book everything is like teaching to the test so teachers have no autonomy they can't like make their own lesson plans they can't like be creative with
mels/009584.pt|well he didn't used to do that towards
mels/031268.pt|the game four it was the best of five set
mels/017640.pt|at the time about shifting your money from here to
mels/008233.pt|in this situation i think it's i think it's terrible
mels/013001.pt|like nothing else is bothering you you're not worried about other tests or
mels/009519.pt|in the same while they're doing it they're
mels/015339.pt|is that basically for them content is not a
mels/008496.pt|lawsuit by twitter to elon musk i read the whole good
mels/029065.pt|as the story but it was a tough situation with curtis after that luckily for me we move all the time because my military family
mels/018496.pt|dollars let's get a bit of a comparison going on here to some even larger numbers that i was put this
mels/026675.pt|i didn't get huge viewership but unfortunately the leadership at twitch and this sort
mels/026306.pt|you have to prioritize and apple's slide
mels/017757.pt|well said anything anything that requires money to
mels/005945.pt|with his pre-plan and then but they're having a good time
mels/021723.pt|we are doing it and then telling us how you
mels/010670.pt|now in fact i think here's the options i
mels/024890.pt|that game when you're doing some kind of dungeon
mels/002642.pt|how will i do this oh i've got a perfect idea
mels/023530.pt|this problem in different ways a great example of a company that is the best in the world is apple because apple has an incredibly low cost
mels/028465.pt|it was my dad's job as he
mels/016008.pt|will be fine they're like all right cool here's the money and they just kept handing them money
mels/015047.pt|faster so internet was getting faster
mels/017860.pt|and post purchase if the game is full of
mels/013248.pt|that kind of connections around twitch you don't want to get yeah you don't want
mels/002200.pt|is that are anywhere close to reliable so i just uh i use my stream budget
mels/021369.pt|because people don't want to watch among us forever so
mels/004384.pt|it's not even a technical situation
mels/020079.pt|it has a massive growth and it makes a
mels/001764.pt|there was a tiny bit of a point
mels/021145.pt|can still be cringe but i think it's more effective
mels/002433.pt|straight up george r martin using
mels/004772.pt|i try this is tesla stock this is like tesla stock was
mels/026432.pt|read it and he's made a conscious choice again most streamers choose not to do
mels/005395.pt|we had some really cool conversations um
mels/021197.pt|and so we're getting space jam
mels/026179.pt|and you were like who are these people who are these absolute peanut brain idiots science has figured out who it was
mels/000138.pt|you're so far behind the goddamn curve
mels/011699.pt|i can get the videos here
mels/030207.pt|and then he started losing pokemon gen
mels/021475.pt|i mean tomorrow's the day so
mels/005195.pt|in my closet and i wore it and then uh
mels/019834.pt|in this game made to gaming culture was making uh country
mels/020365.pt|brother and sister home for christmas
mels/018240.pt|to play this child that was an interesting what was that trying to say like their competitors are the devil or what
mels/000415.pt|and then the lady the lady goes she's
mels/023054.pt|then someone in the eu or us are
mels/002298.pt|at the three months is so different everybody all your viewers still
mels/018513.pt|or business in gaming to win this console war and use that to win the cloud gaming more they have to do that they want to be
mels/024916.pt|if you've already spent money you feel like okay now i'm due now i'm owed i've gotten the
mels/024899.pt|the to get that lazy slow but smart part of your brain to wake up our brain hates using system 2. system
mels/022165.pt|in the real world but because it was good it inspired imitators now there's a lot of ways this can be used i think this this way we saw here is a little bit sweeter one of the ways i've seen use that i
mels/020237.pt|be honest with you that was a good one internet
mels/011538.pt|the problem is the weave army grows by
mels/012835.pt|it's media and the first thing zip davis media did
mels/027229.pt|i think a lot of aaa games
mels/032303.pt|it with you all the nice ones can go you can get a million nice ones and that one negative one sticks with
mels/023652.pt|and it's it's time to every flight
mels/009647.pt|well positivity it's like blind positivity
mels/017074.pt|well not that tragic really not
mels/007160.pt|everyone's got and also different parts
mels/029876.pt|you there were events where like i was i was
mels/016110.pt|thank you no thank you i think we all learned something from that
mels/020474.pt|of tsushima or you play last of us
mels/020023.pt|it's worth about 50 billion right now
mels/013888.pt|i think it was that great i thought it
mels/027790.pt|it's not like a toothbrush you know
mels/013085.pt|not that cool i don't need the
mels/005196.pt|i don't want to spoil the
mels/019003.pt|what about whether whether or not it truly is working but from
mels/011629.pt|isn't a lot of things she's like a big fan of baseball she's a big fan of
mels/007633.pt|does it mean i'm like a
mels/015445.pt|they have the best world-class ip the red
mels/008389.pt|at the tweet if you're not following on twitter
mels/021444.pt|if the money to pay for my dad's surgery or this is almost

mels/006750.pt|see this and then ask you
mels/030962.pt|would like to let you know that i am muting
mels/023342.pt|think more and more more power with brands it's it's a it's a trend that is not slowing at all it's
mels/023215.pt|there is no defined time for how long that chicken needs to have been on free
mels/032417.pt|you know it it just takes practice anyway i i want to show the end here
mels/004295.pt|make a clip of me talking right now we're
mels/001045.pt|is there so you can just figure it all out i'm sure it'll be no problem
mels/000733.pt|like the craziest for big for like
mels/009289.pt|you mean loot boxes yeah i think the way to escape it is probably some sort of legislation to be honest i mean
mels/011647.pt|you can do insane things so what i'm
mels/001752.pt|job of like painting this guy's mental
mels/013166.pt|reacting no no sir i got named i got named and shamed
mels/004448.pt|no no no no no i'm not doing a sunday marketing monday
mels/030757.pt|so when i was at twitch i tweeted this
mels/019530.pt|how did he write this it's so impressive
mels/005812.pt|it's for that but i didn't want it to be like okay let's just talk about this for forever i wouldn't have a chance and by the way i think he has that chance and think he's actually done some funny stuff recently he did the casting of the it's the for that but i didn't want it to be like okay let's just talk about this for forever i want another chance and by the
mels/020503.pt|what a what a reputation they have this was my brilliant summary look at this look at this why is cyberpunk dead on arrival wow look at that look at that that's called production
mels/007550.pt|in the phantom but he says fanta
mels/025111.pt|why researcher this is a campaign by nestle because they've gotten some hot water
mels/000335.pt|the thing and at one point i think i think there's a zombie behind me and it's not a zombie it's ludwig and i
mels/022908.pt|fight and all the emails that are leaking is is actually the emails from sony to epic
mels/020449.pt|we talked about overhyped games in the past is
mels/010282.pt|okay uh so today we'll probably do
mels/028251.pt|you basically need a lot of fives fives and
mels/012525.pt|in the dark okay i i don't need my the things that make
mels/027861.pt|to the moon to the moon
mels/024565.pt|hard to enforce it would take like you know a big team that apple doesn't want to spend and like a lot of auditors and
mels/016071.pt|what is bringing forward the latest medium
mels/008038.pt|so far have you seen the
mels/003383.pt|to continue to compete even after his little finger was put in a cast joining us now is assistant professor from the university of michigan and core faculty at their robotics
mels/001601.pt|i legitimately think you'll find it
mels/007847.pt|i just listened to two hours of tupac
mels/009175.pt|one out of tens that's why i um
mels/024757.pt|and actually fun to play beautiful game and so it has removed all
mels/026113.pt|which i found to be quite impressive and it led to
mels/023916.pt|and i never understood when my dad
mels/012385.pt|i didn't like kids found everything
mels/028184.pt|im looking at their balance sheet and
mels/019987.pt|of their ip a lot of their most famous heroes were already licensed
mels/015762.pt|well they sort of did with
mels/020434.pt|let's go indeed sprite you know it remains to be seen whether history will look back on lebron for his basketball achievements or for his achievements
mels/015316.pt|if it makes money back all they care is that you stick around with prime prime is a bigger deal to them and what they're sort of doing is they're
mels/003258.pt|on store shelves and has sales figures is
mels/011442.pt|in a barber you want that
mels/024987.pt|from a brain is how much money you're going
mels/005209.pt|way they said he was like oh great
mels/013344.pt|well it's a it's a tale that i regret but i wanted to tell you that it happened
mels/026278.pt|fact this number is actually going down it's not like
mels/018556.pt|if the value dick now i think the real winner on both
mels/012910.pt|he just has had a cool life and he's
mels/008833.pt|there's nobody on earth that rich
mels/022945.pt|in this story i want that to be clear none of these companies is thinking about anything other than how do they get themselves rich but and i will say this i'll just say it up front i do lean towards the side of epic
mels/011712.pt|well let me see if i have the video uh
mels/005822.pt|he like he didn't he he hadn't thought about it at all he didn't care and he made a bunch of
mels/025713.pt|it's like too targeted at your competitor i think
mels/002016.pt|and so i get entrenched like i stick my
mels/021467.pt|which was so cool which was so cool was that people were so disgusted and so unanimous in their anger like they did a million
mels/013966.pt|if you buy something and it arrives
mels/030008.pt|what would i ever why would i ever why would i ever
mels/017589.pt|well it's likely going to be able to resell for a good value
mels/016826.pt|unless of our time watching those quibby bad example
mels/012477.pt|tap me on the shoulder and
mels/010231.pt|yeah he's he's he's a wild one i think i mean he's got a unique ability to really not care he'll do
mels/012817.pt|is the biggest league tournament in the
mels/029660.pt|i walked away from there like
mels/030834.pt|you later in life that's right i expect to see you in chat
mels/024127.pt|anybody here hey i didn't see
mels/012740.pt|war stuff but real life is not like that
mels/012467.pt|i mean was there i thought he was dead i thought he was kidnapped
mels/022053.pt|which is about domestic abuse saying you had pizza
mels/026541.pt|we can over the internet all my mods play it
mels/002372.pt|broke me because i had to wake up just a few hours later for breakfast and i couldn't get back to sleep and it threw off my
mels/029452.pt|and he brings out cube world
mels/016629.pt|the number of days above 70 degrees in a
mels/023173.pt|it's literally frozen anyway one one more thing that
mels/000476.pt|ask for a blt and they say
mels/007140.pt|is like everyone can feel a little bit rest easier when someone starts coughing but after everyone throws their masks off you start
mels/024337.pt|way the leading man sometimes a change of name is more than a change of name sometimes it's a chance to show the world
mels/026147.pt|threat to their conference he uploaded a sex game to roblox use slurs so
mels/003211.pt|many people in debt basically what turns out what happened is not only were they not making money originally even when
mels/024516.pt|you didn't even notice us adding this new payment
mels/007791.pt|to myself yeah i could do that otherwise you would yeah exactly yeah yeah
mels/018901.pt|they can't so we have a genius plan here's what we'll do we'll take
mels/025678.pt|but it was not effective for the
mels/019186.pt|in the early 90s when Nintendo became
mels/030524.pt|both her parents because i am not
mels/007034.pt|it is awesome because i really cherish
mels/026627.pt|billion dollars in cash on hand google has 170
mels/012601.pt|it is what i'm saying i'm saying sell your house get your parents
mels/022237.pt|if the story of just the parents
mels/028861.pt|no i didn't do any of that no what i
mels/003114.pt|at the competing service so i don't know maybe it's just
mels/019004.pt|it is certainly interesting as a marketer because her engagement numbers right from the beginning were off the
mels/026941.pt|we'll frustrations rocket mortgage positions them as real problems offers them as the the
mels/006150.pt|not that i need to not that i need you guys to know but i
mels/020216.pt|it's creepy surprise and put it on the menu
mels/004096.pt|let's start let's just really get into it you know let's just start spending most of my day maybe i'll learn the dances that could be huge for me
mels/002967.pt|this is a serious it's not a spoilers no
mels/026426.pt|like like let's say a ludwig speech ludwig has drastically when he was on twitch this is different now but
mels/029458.pt|i have something to say so now i start playing a little
mels/017373.pt|what marvel okay because new data has shown that over
mels/003162.pt|if the their users that's number one uh number two
mels/026103.pt|of a person sort of putting their physical
mels/013701.pt|cream twitter and all that people are obsessed with
mels/026879.pt|the story which was punctuated with two bad
mels/006520.pt|what you can at the time there is there's never
mels/030399.pt|listen we have a very important crossroads approaching us sir
mels/024585.pt|invested in heroic tim sweeney here i would like to read a quote from the judge of this case so epic games made the claim at one point that apple's contract was unconscionable which means it was
mels/023060.pt|get ninja skin you know do your part little do you know
mels/030118.pt|i am in pure denial my dad is angry he skipped right to angry because
mels/026253.pt|worth more than the entire net worth of elon
mels/005530.pt|he did coding for like health insurance companies so i really
mels/023901.pt|the old or something pound way back in the day and he's now the oldest person to
mels/008691.pt|who has done a bunch of these and he just thinks the bot stuff is laughable it
mels/005645.pt|night we have a good time uh
mels/024453.pt|at the foot long and just
mels/003147.pt|and it seems to be now it's not having as an immediate impact on metastock because
mels/024387.pt|they built a gigantic duplicate on a set it includes costume costumes designed by
mels/029505.pt|and for example we talked about that a little moment
mels/024278.pt|hard marketing monday head it's called
mels/003892.pt|well i can't imagine he gets primaried i
mels/005390.pt|your nail art into an nft
mels/029641.pt|what that was like like here
mels/014301.pt|sloshing around for creators to pick up
mels/021818.pt|so you don't have to a marketing monday

mels/003920.pt|in the highest office in the land of 300
mels/025372.pt|i was like yeah i did everything i was like yep i said that that's me and
mels/026638.pt|i want to show you one more thing let me show you the value of microsoft as a company you'll notice you can't even see anything else this gigantic 60 billion dollar activision
mels/001209.pt|don't you don't need to get started in marketing now if you're 19 and you're
mels/010689.pt|you don't need to read too
mels/000880.pt|i'm looking you up you well you haven't posted at all
mels/021498.pt|thirty three dollars or three hundred dollars and it's
mels/017912.pt|are quiet theater and nothing there's nothing here it's over it's
mels/028961.pt|so they were all gone and i realized that i have lost
mels/006176.pt|are sold that he literally made
mels/001755.pt|we're checking out version of the
mels/022817.pt|this much money it was kind of worth what it
mels/019719.pt|it's a growing population thing then in
mels/028635.pt|i'm platt and i keep dying i keep losing
mels/028109.pt|if segment where i do a deeper dive this was
mels/027962.pt|the be replacing justin lin who you probably don't know by face or name but he did create magician movie now you see me which famously has quote unquote magicians performing actual magic it might actually be good because that kind of cheesy
mels/013629.pt|wait a minute what the this
mels/002129.pt|and there's no shot this doesn't get a
mels/017898.pt|are you by yourself yes have you tried to get out
mels/017152.pt|thoughts on san jose living here is high
mels/030337.pt|it's the woman at the end of world war ii
mels/014702.pt|to the the good stuff um let me
mels/011501.pt|the clown prince of crime's origin
mels/029389.pt|i just felt like i was out of it the
mels/031734.pt|anime characters is there a big conspiracy going on here
mels/016500.pt|i did on the biggest trend of his lifetime to go the internet and
mels/012964.pt|we don't want to have to pay back all that debt just makes you grind
mels/012079.pt|well these journeys and i'm many
mels/002583.pt|it's a total of four but it wasn't
mels/004040.pt|and i and i was sick
mels/027625.pt|thanks because he's the world's richest man he can tell china to
mels/006350.pt|earned and you know what let's say
mels/024800.pt|to take a photo and share your friends that you got something cool which makes you think
mels/024742.pt|in consoles then we added the pc to the mix in the late 80s then handheld comes
mels/015405.pt|at idea so the next few years are
mels/005347.pt|and hassan comes in and he's like two three rows ahead of me okay hassan's like two
mels/016608.pt|info and not send them down crazy
mels/019249.pt|that people would take pictures and download
mels/009684.pt|on the dotted line today i'm not kidding i locked that
mels/025343.pt|because they needed someone quickly and and i worked at
mels/002842.pt|his arguments and said we're gonna
mels/013666.pt|name of the platform from mixer to atriac
mels/018807.pt|and rewatch it's a little crunch but for the time this has set apple's marketing strategy for the next three decades they're the outsider
mels/018892.pt|some kind of video i could show you a new streaming service aimed at the younger generation quibby is short for quick bites all the
mels/026590.pt|the ninja and his wife just owned gold so
mels/021619.pt|it on purpose i'm sorry for mansplaining
mels/014188.pt|wake who i think can bring over a lot of people and get a lot of new inspiring streamers to try let me explain why that's important so we're going to get out of this and we're going to get into
mels/012499.pt|per night which is really high
mels/024867.pt|these achievers this is where the whales live if you are in the achievers zone you are
mels/003193.pt|but we can follow that up with an easy win and that is uh second chances okay second chances
mels/016814.pt|it and no one had the phone
mels/002226.pt|okay but um are we going to have vegan
mels/025014.pt|so here's an example i i did some research here i
mels/023509.pt|in the amount of dealerships so look at this
mels/002123.pt|who took a massive chunk of the votes by
mels/026468.pt|it's not something i don't use please make one
mels/030469.pt|among us i said your ring finger looks
mels/001166.pt|and i use a service called sprig but i
mels/015414.pt|what if you are a family that
mels/018889.pt|i agree with most of your ratings
mels/029985.pt|number one it wasn't because he
mels/023811.pt|at the office lately seems to be causing a
mels/026299.pt|or example but gap has stood out from its peers in places like malls which are all dying in general by a better
mels/015603.pt|and guess what everyone's kind of getting broke you know the the market is bifurcating
mels/003515.pt|it's not the first time this has happened in history like
mels/017936.pt|it's money if you're like the lions or something you can just be
mels/020469.pt|launch so it sold a ton and
mels/018537.pt|they're not worried about making extra money by selling a few more copies of
mels/023372.pt|is discord ever i tagged him and said this is wrong
mels/012267.pt|this kid went to lightsaber training
mels/014575.pt|stream i'll go to youtube and just do youtube
mels/018844.pt|i first laid eyes on you I told myself she's the one and then why
mels/014432.pt|it can be very powerful and so they want to win this war same with cloud gaming when
mels/009297.pt|just go and a bunch of games i put money into riot
mels/030341.pt|it cuts off a little lower you know it
mels/021568.pt|what is hedging your bets hedging your bets is basically taking a bet that's the opposite of what you
mels/006549.pt|and then it's a fail and i hope that people um
mels/026485.pt|it didn't own the rights so i already
mels/001916.pt|it's criminal what happens to the people uh job creators like

mels/021833.pt|to some other billionaires out there who maybe aren't as eloquent in their writing capabilities okay maybe they're
mels/001384.pt|trying to throw me off i'm gonna guess oh
mels/026642.pt|muscle they get from opening one industry to buy out or dominate others and it creates a very interesting competitive landscape okay muscle they get from owning one industry to uh buy out or dominate others and it
mels/011458.pt|that is the bar that most actually not this

mels/015189.pt|well market that netflix operates in they're
mels/012305.pt|and i'm dejected obviously because i
mels/017534.pt|below are becoming tuned out to them and so marketing
mels/027438.pt|this past week i saw the worst influencer campaign of all time
mels/020051.pt|so if you get a chance it
mels/009287.pt|grab mindset in some way you
mels/011823.pt|i like the eight full-time character actors
mels/031235.pt|well how to make esports big in the west it turns out they didn't need me they just needed fortnite i was irrelevant to that idea but at the time i was like i'm
mels/008948.pt|was that smart i think he i think he sold tesla shares at the top just because like most ceos at the time
mels/017639.pt|we're talking about spending your money when i
mels/012769.pt|i don't think lorenzo is one
mels/029981.pt|but that was a host number one which
mels/019396.pt|are cumulative score we wrote this down
mels/021213.pt|inside of people are for these shows so you'll notice a few shows are worth like hundreds of these average shows so like the boys the mandalorian the crown westworld these few
mels/004184.pt|it's to get back to me and then they're like okay so how about two o'clock on a tuesday
mels/027238.pt|can be daniel dwyer had a great as nasty as the
mels/022468.pt|all the time i'm gonna show you one more that i found to be super impressive only because i've heard the marketers that
mels/021750.pt|twelve hours a day and i would eat one meal a day a single jimmy john sandwich
mels/017448.pt|of legends which is the saddest reason of all that is
mels/023844.pt|the pain and just say your kid will be super lucky to have you as a dad and he said
mels/004729.pt|it's the same strat one more time
mels/010584.pt|you meow to try and get access is that is that what i'm
mels/021812.pt|the helpful to real people in their real lives and then there's some stuff i want to make fun of so i got it all it's not just about
mels/029322.pt|what i was wearing and i thought this was
mels/022877.pt|all participants for more than 20 minutes so an actual court case
mels/021515.pt|lose their own personal money they have lost all the other rituals money who they
mels/005583.pt|and then all of a sudden like 30 minutes
mels/011261.pt|when you said you were gonna
mels/012193.pt|the that a prison or something because chewbacca
mels/008877.pt|minimum daily active users discussion you know
mels/013734.pt|be doing it he called a bomb threat to
mels/004123.pt|extend that's a big company and so you don't need to pester them if they happen
mels/030116.pt|we find out very quickly the tech almost
mels/026870.pt|while comparing them to this will show you how how far they can fall next we got avocados from mexico this is
mels/010146.pt|wearing chevy oh nice little drink though
mels/027506.pt|been running for a very long time and it has made almost no money if you go to the max twitter basically has been
mels/003326.pt|wage increases we've seen in a while though unfortunately they are still both of them behind inflation so even if you switch jobs they got a
mels/032006.pt|a lot of people are going to make
mels/029151.pt|what there's no sale i just played for
mels/018694.pt|generously i believe about this much as a company let me let me let me explain why i'm talking about this okay microsoft as a
mels/029185.pt|but i was definitely a start nine spammer
mels/011693.pt|want to be that guy that that's not that there's no benefit to doing
mels/029606.pt|i can't even you can't even touch him you can't
mels/026838.pt|one of the big stories of all the
mels/014468.pt|his podcast where i think it goes into more detail and we had a lot of talks about it and the advice that i gave him was that because he was telling me that a lot of people were telling his podcast where i think he goes into more detail and we had a lot of talks about it and
mels/030358.pt|i don't know if you heard about it in a movie or a book or what but like
mels/007813.pt|want to add a picture of jeff bezos shirtless
mels/009565.pt|as ever and they were actually playing
mels/026819.pt|in our lunch because the very people they want to attract which are again high revenue and the young are going to
mels/023144.pt|better than any other field because you're already going to be hungry okay the
mels/003666.pt|it doesn't bother me that somebody invents something
mels/032157.pt|it's a big table one person rolls a dice
mels/021591.pt|a panic and a snowball effect then it starts going down to zero okay once it goes down from somebody selling
mels/022106.pt|noticed happen again and again never ever ever do anything at all that involves ai or fan submissions ever because you get this i had to censor these
mels/006797.pt|that point he didn't win again
mels/011495.pt|in phoenix was good in it
mels/001185.pt|i don't know i know it's not canada because
mels/004382.pt|cut the beginning there's no point for us to
mels/011934.pt|is the best actor in the whole thing this guy is the most committed he is literally like
mels/010156.pt|no i know he's he's on board with it he just wants to
mels/025454.pt|it's a few minutes before this segment for the youtube viewers a few minutes before
mels/030183.pt|me and ludwig just being competitive are
mels/016318.pt|like look at commercials from the past present and future uh see if
mels/020874.pt|well there's a fire the problem is insurance companies
mels/017905.pt|conspicuously consume them so if you're an apple watch user everyone knows it it's a walking advertisement for the brand
mels/025728.pt|for the modern internet that's the way things spread nowadays the best piece of advice i got was literally design content for a group chat it is it is though it is way
mels/006551.pt|huge growth rates and the things they use it for most are clothing
mels/009096.pt|my voice is not always quiet
mels/029413.pt|that the waiter would come back and be
mels/003264.pt|keep joking i'm over here buying bible
mels/027726.pt|world though you have the pleasure you have the honor
mels/012005.pt|one because they're talking to you directly
mels/023884.pt|every job a human could do
mels/032037.pt|so i've told this story but
mels/008957.pt|for twitter as an excuse i don't i don't think he needs to do a
mels/021867.pt|i say okay eventually i'm gonna get
mels/027727.pt|living in this timeline the timeline where
mels/024000.pt|i got them all of like fans lee and fan house
mels/001691.pt|all of the reasons they hate
mels/013365.pt|at best tweets so here's what's different
mels/024220.pt|we're on billboards or or wherever it's just to make most of them were made for the
mels/028630.pt|what can book over them and during those fake
mels/019950.pt|what to this is because my honest opinion and theory is that from a marketing
mels/031964.pt|in the back of the row
mels/028197.pt|it's freaking out and so twitch in one of twitch's first big like
mels/002028.pt|targeted you know what i'm saying i i understand that white people are not in
mels/026967.pt|i think they need more than this i i i
mels/029796.pt|tag along with you and i remember talking to
mels/032379.pt|by the way if anyone saw i went accidentally
mels/029569.pt|it almost feels cheesy these days when we
mels/020348.pt|and then they have his wife not be you know she's not even supportive which is funny there's a lot of small choices that could have been like they could have gone safer and they didn't and that's why i'm impressed it's a good ad but
mels/011697.pt|so okay so let me let me see i have videos i have videos
mels/026023.pt|it's so i told christopher robin that anyone can
mels/007972.pt|at tomorrow because i'm doing marketing monday so
mels/025047.pt|yeah i guess i guess that's true it's like who's going into a bird king and
mels/020308.pt|it part of the show this is a good ad on a lot of levels
mels/012806.pt|and and you know i i was doing all right and when i was on this team you know i
mels/009326.pt|i feel like unless you mean like switch style even still i think zero shot but
mels/002571.pt|very awkward okay but now i don't want to do a pity
mels/021432.pt|when they came knocking that's like their boss i mean that's how
mels/024653.pt|real estate companies in china went down 80
mels/027109.pt|the charlie munger at age 98
mels/031846.pt|that's crazy this is where ninja like was born this
mels/009317.pt|just don't do it forehead just don't be depressed forehead
mels/031616.pt|i was going for for forty years the word i'm looking for foreign foreigners
mels/003278.pt|it's very very hot in spain right now so you can't blame them okay and that's good news somehow it's incredibly hot in spain
mels/001211.pt|and you want to get started marketing but don't want to go to college for a marketing degree then that's more interesting uh it's
mels/028511.pt|one month's best work or something like
mels/024605.pt|get stage ladies and gentlemen the future his truck resume had two trucks come on stage behind me next when this is an get on stage ladies and gentlemen the future is truck
mels/032053.pt|i just meant he had large expense
mels/007476.pt|i have a burger i just i don't yeah so she really warned me off of
mels/000806.pt|at the hundreds back and then once i have that fat wallet
mels/030206.pt|our money matches he had to
mels/007996.pt|why do you have a job
mels/010015.pt|well shootings i it's in the video it's it's
mels/028490.pt|i can tell right in that moment my dad
mels/024787.pt|what are they have different currencies but
mels/006754.pt|and bingo and i was thinking this would be really fun i've done some
mels/002893.pt|i just borrow against this they have no tax
mels/016666.pt|that like you know like when you're checking out at some stores and they'll have like the little white thing and you can swipe it it's a kind of a genius payments company that made it easy for the average mom and pop shop to take digital payments
mels/018254.pt|oh my god i give it a point for just
mels/017941.pt|i'd have to do more research
mels/007764.pt|to put my pants on yeah this is crazy i just
mels/009306.pt|so there should be something how can it be gambling
mels/009407.pt|let's see what they go for i'm honestly expecting
mels/010787.pt|don't have anything related to it
mels/016624.pt|let me see if i can get my exact stat here
mels/008315.pt|in the grow up every day that we're not technically in
mels/030539.pt|demon was already on the way out
mels/028598.pt|later on in the season they just don't have a later on snapchat but this is at least
mels/016391.pt|about the economics of it more than i do like
mels/023293.pt|the drink water and immediately coke stock price
mels/032174.pt|and then i lose it and i
mels/001742.pt|helps somebody on the deck or
mels/028416.pt|i the military he started out you know when we were when i was a
mels/024357.pt|we have anything to do with beer and the ending reveal is you know it's okay
mels/026430.pt|there is a much higher chance than let's say
mels/010634.pt|i almost cursed that's where i would
mels/014523.pt|my own thoughts and opinions but mischief
mels/021966.pt|it's like the idea is that you're picking something hard something challenging that you think most other people that have your goal won't do let's say you follow all my
mels/017582.pt|it's still is very good at this section of the clock but other companies have
mels/018002.pt|that solves some problems but creates
mels/024019.pt|what that so this is what their plan was and
mels/031925.pt|well of our friends and this is not like uh
mels/030907.pt|i mean we'll get you something i'm
mels/011722.pt|yup just yet okay i'm gonna
mels/008534.pt|tyson foods is one of the biggest food conglomerates in the world and back in the early
mels/025819.pt|this is in my mind far and away the best video game film or tv adaptation ever having seen i think all of them oh yeah
mels/014002.pt|was last day um i will be thinking
mels/006228.pt|you idiots get bluffed if you lose call them
mels/027150.pt|a recession there's like no way around
mels/029283.pt|indeed mondays are kind of the two big things
mels/007258.pt|i was going to distract from like him making his breakout
mels/026170.pt|and to read that news thank god blizzard's in
mels/009879.pt|in dollars it's a great time to move to
mels/032348.pt|which leads me to believe he cheated in hog likely with
mels/032124.pt|push up your glasses thing before he tells a girl she has hpv
mels/027791.pt|what i'm saying it's not a fine instrument it's a sledgehammer
mels/015737.pt|i did it for ted lasso i did
mels/004986.pt|that this is having any benefit i mean keep buying it then i am well he's not buying enough because the
mels/027543.pt|way more you should generally take it right but the board was was as you guys have probably seen the board of twitter has been fighting
mels/016098.pt|i think you're a bit too worried about your face and not enough
mels/008988.pt|you can't make them cheaper but
mels/011553.pt|isn't the back that's the only that's a
mels/012099.pt|it was like an older kind of
mels/014382.pt|i think beyond this there's nothing that holds you there because the
mels/008292.pt|well no i don't i don't want to do that you're asking me i'm already talking about going too far beyond and you're saying no you should make
mels/026177.pt|obscure it all together nobody made this game here's the new call of duty vanguard we don't know where it came from we don't know who made it
mels/011065.pt|i can't i can't find sphinx
mels/023542.pt|the reason for that is because it's artificially lowered it's not gonna last forever and
mels/016918.pt|with the prime look at denis thank
mels/024728.pt|it's the top no no no no no no
mels/011461.pt|the the goat he's been so good at rapping for so
mels/023552.pt|do this they would lower the price drive competitors out of business and
mels/030948.pt|what i'm doing it goes like this all right
mels/011397.pt|no i didn't buy that i didn't buy that
mels/006271.pt|is your friend kobe reacted to it
mels/025653.pt|an hour later is worth ninety dollars a coin by three am
mels/005404.pt|the discord and then copy paste and then
mels/021173.pt|i will not get all of these right but
mels/030266.pt|wait yourself with and i was like what
mels/030999.pt|in sell for massively inflated prices there was a crop of mysterious arsons happening in rank controlled apartments
mels/014061.pt|the average engineer is like a copy paste you know someone doesn't really know
mels/020919.pt|you're more likely to make emotional and bad decisions chase opportunity now and your passion
mels/015257.pt|i have to have and if they can keep that default position and reduce churn it gives them a massive advantage of everybody else because even if someone else gets a hit it's like they keep netflix they sign up for the new service they watch the show and they leave they don't they don't drop netflix for that new thing and keep it
mels/025886.pt|in response i i think the best way to explain this actually i want to explain
mels/030875.pt|the time i'm old you know what that's like
mels/009746.pt|so he can go infiltrate the gang and that would be stupid enough that
mels/003072.pt|the problem is that my wins and fails lately
mels/028680.pt|that's why i got this pillow and
mels/007985.pt|yeah it's great no i know

mels/016249.pt|team does it but i was looking at the lakers final tweet and i saw this one and it was interesting
mels/004202.pt|zoomed out thousand foot look at the situation really
mels/005781.pt|product my youtube analytics i just opened up my youtube analytics
mels/014412.pt|for youtube is technically just so much better but that should be
mels/029744.pt|cause you could actually do it like a one of

mels/019488.pt|the youtube content right now why
mels/016843.pt|what the actual impact will be but the depth and number of parameters in these ai models has increased exponentially
mels/015521.pt|cost as much to make as the final season of game of thrones so
mels/010821.pt|that really brings out the worst
mels/011886.pt|cause this is a plus like this look
mels/011760.pt|when i say because i'm playing along
mels/008895.pt|i think people that are really into the

mels/016602.pt|find everything you do continuing let's go fast
mels/015547.pt|in the minds and so what it seems like to me is that apple tv is the equivalent of jack dorsey ceo of twitter spending hundreds of millions of dollars to buy title he just wants to hang out with
mels/006718.pt|are you talking about and he was like no
mels/007016.pt|and i said i like sour candy i did it live

mels/012145.pt|his character like the most nice
mels/023656.pt|is that i hadn't seen before so i liked it a
mels/020511.pt|the same hype are are much smaller and after months of crunch all their actions leading up to the launch instead of seeming mysterious or being explainable away all seem more negative in hindsight cyber punk twenty seventy seven runs surprisingly well on current gen consoles the same hype are are much smaller and after months of crunch all of their actions leading up to the launch instead of seeming mysterious or being explainable away all seem more negative in hindsight cyberpunk 2077

mels/026985.pt|of for an ad and so i i i have to give it some credit i know
mels/014647.pt|let's fix this light so it's not so
mels/017081.pt|your tweet there was nothing banger about
mels/024641.pt|know that the chinese economy has been growing rapidly over the past
mels/013906.pt|that he set up on a stand next to an open trash bin burning fire
mels/019989.pt|interacts with like sony and other companies so even if you buy marvel half the
mels/013277.pt|it's super smash brothers tournament chat do you guys think we could win are you guys good enough at spamming commands into a twitch chat very interesting all of you immediately said no and then you all said
mels/002557.pt|super lucky start you might be our
mels/005130.pt|i don't got a lot this weekend
mels/027569.pt|republicans in congress were getting ready to sue twitter for not doing their fiduciary duty
mels/014381.pt|three things there is there's nothing left holding someone on twitch i don't think i
mels/004843.pt|it'd be able to see it
mels/001623.pt|how do you guys think i should
mels/015534.pt|you'll get this diamond encrusted apple watch okay like i even put modern
mels/020369.pt|why why why even include that the whole
mels/019756.pt|the capability of becoming the most
mels/023736.pt|lot of huge markups in the branded
mels/010293.pt|well would probably gonna ask him to be a captain
mels/031468.pt|so yeah there was like this fancy ass plate ready there then
mels/006757.pt|i just do it all right
mels/000922.pt|in the world and not one person has been able to pick something it's
mels/027634.pt|we tried to cash out 40 billion dollars of
mels/002955.pt|and you know what i'm saying it feels like it's fine and people are
mels/016029.pt|i really appreciate them for supporting me again if you want to
mels/001427.pt|i saying that right yeah close enough okay cool
mels/030529.pt|to our apartment to watch the dogs
mels/022949.pt|i'm not at that level in my career i could never imagine talking to another company's like top executives and being
mels/021674.pt|i gotta put this probably in mediocre this guy what if the
mels/004245.pt|you can appreciate forever at 100 x
mels/023361.pt|you know either way there's a
mels/031704.pt|i even googled that right there is perfect
mels/021023.pt|said the brand a bunch so you're more i think if the movie was
mels/018445.pt|you already have all of your games on steam a massive library if they could just find an easy way for you to stream those
mels/008944.pt|or couldn't do it but to sign the agreement
mels/015913.pt|big shows they want to watch so it's a tough balance you forgot arcane i didn't mention it but obviously it's a great show
mels/005474.pt|because it's like it's like almost admitting that it's gone too far it's gone too far um but
mels/010731.pt|for this sponsor but it won't start until around
mels/002114.pt|it was me talking about a third party
mels/009147.pt|honestly honestly one of the worst
mels/029773.pt|and android win doubles and they get
mels/026422.pt|it's sold way more subs than me and in fact
mels/007084.pt|it would love to take that picture
mels/025509.pt|so this is actually altruistic what we're doing this is
mels/011797.pt|the ship okay kidnapping yeah exactly
mels/026925.pt|all they're really trying to get across is
mels/000068.pt|how many years it is one year baby
mels/024224.pt|this extra money because you could shoot a very cheap ad that has amazing viral
mels/016366.pt|you american jobs and small businesses instead according to law enforcement it funded a swim up bar and a horse stable the buyer that's worth
mels/019543.pt|we know what it's bottom of b because i actually think it
mels/030650.pt|people start getting kicked out some
mels/021250.pt|three times retail while the xbox is
mels/012057.pt|it was cringe should be your shielder
mels/018453.pt|steam x luna steam you know
mels/011138.pt|i have no idea what's happening
mels/010123.pt|good tip good tip king a good advice get advice for the children does not look like he is taking it well let's find out why he got pepper spread that's good tip good tip king hey good advice good advice for the children
mels/020222.pt|durex launches a revolutionary new app
mels/009131.pt|because on my last video about
mels/013162.pt|yeah that sounds fun straight up playing the
mels/006893.pt|with the maker that i used religiously
mels/029084.pt|was able to create their own global
mels/002487.pt|in in their products to basically ensure they get a
mels/028755.pt|at my parents home in colorado colorado
mels/011525.pt|the propaganda by somebody way wealthier than you that they've just like put the
mels/000579.pt|supposed to be like a really bad physical prop combat comedian
mels/016262.pt|if the the game no injuries hasn't missed the
mels/012449.pt|i already got into it ari got into it
mels/002135.pt|with the full article that i can't read because it
mels/005976.pt|i knew he was like i've played melee with
mels/023716.pt|that's good that's clever that one
mels/024446.pt|so it's a win for me
mels/018129.pt|if the computer and we can't move ahead
mels/009044.pt|together i'm not opposed can you say the code out loud so i can get in i only have one monitor you know what for you i will i will read the code out loud for all the one monitor andy's who are
mels/028329.pt|salty salty salty salty salty salty
mels/002401.pt|i don't understand whenever you say i'm east east coast
mels/010181.pt|i think so we don't have any narcs so
mels/006559.pt|that's the part where they get
mels/000610.pt|there you know there's battle scenes
mels/029230.pt|with the open the curtain for him
mels/026869.pt|in mind because this i think in my mind was probably one of the best uses
mels/017419.pt|i read this article was how much of it seemed to be based off of number one
mels/021979.pt|in gross and that's why jeff bezos does the
mels/009804.pt|worse than the crash of the deutsche mark absolutely not no that was that was
mels/020039.pt|this is the google pie okay this part is youtube this part is what's called google network and then this part in yellow is search advertising okay which is what doubleclick allowed them to do which became incredibly lucrative and also let them run ads on other
mels/022926.pt|it doesn't make money for us you know what makes us money is getting a ton of kids to play it on
mels/006588.pt|but i think the funniest thing that i saw was this
mels/021697.pt|oh i oh no he's right it's cringe now
mels/014420.pt|i think it's going to be fighting over these main things fighting over key concentrator groups
mels/023880.pt|listen there's gonna be some positive
mels/000682.pt|it's a new it's brand new
mels/028439.pt|it's my dad was like all
mels/013606.pt|i just like no i got it don't worry
mels/013018.pt|so you could actually maybe even
mels/009383.pt|and that's what ninjas should do to i guess
mels/025430.pt|in your spare time hello from paris did i
mels/006381.pt|people like that but overwhelming people are pretty pissed
mels/010873.pt|it only makes me stronger i thanks for thanks for killing me i learned every loss is a lesson and then
mels/014510.pt|i can get it because it's even funny it's like
mels/011476.pt|and i think processing through it is good for you if you end up in the right spot i guess if you if you end up
mels/011904.pt|i thought she was one of the actors the whole trip until the
mels/001977.pt|good yeah you could market it well it'd be fun it'd be a fun challenge you could
mels/015676.pt|three companies is missing something they need to make some changes
mels/022410.pt|geico logo and it's enjoyable it's one of the first ads i've seen
mels/015625.pt|and this was an article recently this year
mels/005336.pt|but because i thought it was so funny i leaned into it and i was
mels/003297.pt|i give me that one uh and
mels/004732.pt|around okay enough tomfoolery we got a big piece of news today we need to talk about it and it starts with this guy
mels/026812.pt|a massive drop in the amount of advertisers wanting to spend on facebook
mels/012860.pt|for junior and senior year late last life
mels/031105.pt|that money i i literally know that i i remember telling

mels/018446.pt|computer or monitor or phone you'd already be locked in you don't want to leave your library behind valve is just slow the real problem with valve and steam is
mels/012035.pt|and then you hold it for half a second
mels/004853.pt|the extra effort to just chop off
mels/012941.pt|what you can't do with paid
mels/001173.pt|i feel like about factor is that it's
mels/028583.pt|boys what else what else can i answer for you oh a league story

mels/000303.pt|it's really fun and i was catching up i
mels/026102.pt|actually there's no actual picket line at night but the striking
mels/031330.pt|so my dad has to fly out so i had to tell my parents what was going on and that i needed my dad to fly out and so he had to buy
mels/006073.pt|what he dropped that ass album with no promo out
mels/018759.pt|with sony and microsoft so i think i talked about this
mels/005184.pt|with full painted american flag nails
mels/019981.pt|sometimes four and marvel at this point
mels/026223.pt|owed money exactly on time with no missed payments it's it's fine
mels/015357.pt|if this happens to small streamers a lot
mels/013024.pt|like you know taxes and investing
mels/015278.pt|are they're doing well they're they're big
mels/018265.pt|yeah listen you generally don't want to do commercials about dying pets you also don't generally don't want to do commercials about suicide you also generally don't want the commercials about pet necromancy cats getting mauled by
mels/018057.pt|this is american healthcare this is our solution oh they need help with
mels/018370.pt|okay if you feel like nobody notices when you do your work
mels/020872.pt|businesses will not buy a building or an office or anything unless they can get insurance on it they just won't it's too
mels/002236.pt|as some dumb stuff about like two-ply
mels/003510.pt|considering that you studied this more than us do you think about
mels/012751.pt|is he at one point had more games of
mels/008073.pt|so you think that i represent all
mels/016322.pt|i wrote the shamrock shake and his lore was that he was a cousin of grimace who would come from ireland
mels/007650.pt|no idea it's called the title
mels/002172.pt|yeah out of every single no that sounds wrong
mels/024569.pt|they brought in multiple expert witnesses and by the end of it
mels/019884.pt|believe me but in this game
mels/025613.pt|the illuminati and the robot lizard people that zuckerberg is trying to
mels/011452.pt|gen z in china has got it just as bad as
mels/011433.pt|so she'll be gone so it's
mels/013348.pt|instead you know what it was me i did do the
mels/006641.pt|i like that you're watching me at work
mels/022313.pt|impact on me as a marketer now these are not the best five ads of all time okay these are literally just five
mels/024549.pt|one line that one line the
mels/010518.pt|at the tragedy it is that i couldn't get you for my
mels/012298.pt|you credits they gave you credits
mels/001167.pt|i can talk about them because they're defunct back when i lived in san francisco proper i would order sprig every day until eventually they made me the
mels/009755.pt|insane and then so it's nicholas cage
mels/028156.pt|is doing that very quickly because of this deal falling through unless they find a way to
mels/032145.pt|i'm just at the atm thank god my bank says no you can't withdraw two thousand dollars randomly so i get
mels/032100.pt|really furiously eating my snacks but as
mels/005063.pt|i gotta i gotta say i don't think it's uh i don't think it's
mels/004149.pt|this stuff and also most importantly i have to like respond to them and like send them stats on the the views and yeah you have to like do things and this is so funny because i'm on the other side of this deal all the time like from the brand side we have to work with influencers and i'm often like in the position like hey we need this we paid you
mels/012695.pt|must be some problems too the riot fighting
mels/016556.pt|the major health breakthroughs there's benefits and downsides and that's the one thing
mels/028026.pt|it's been progress with the amazon union progress
mels/021411.pt|i mean that's that's a short squeeze the last
mels/031961.pt|the the video you could tell the difference the
mels/003421.pt|will china is trying to isolate them and downplay it in preparation for
mels/019144.pt|no let me tell you I'm not
mels/027244.pt|any aspect of elden ring is quote unquote perfect as it can never be improved
mels/020465.pt|implications than just one game being a
mels/014226.pt|that would be watching marketing monday maybe now
mels/001025.pt|you're doing a thing but i will show this one because this
mels/025445.pt|the entire internet for people that respect our our our history our lineage and our fallen soldiers but because today a giant statue of harambe the gorilla was put up right across from the wall street ball to the race for
mels/005775.pt|and then misskin was like oh yeah
mels/016931.pt|and that's why i want to talk about the company that helped make all
mels/013494.pt|league of legends i would always be like one more game and
mels/017236.pt|at january because apparently it's popular for people who have alcoholism or drink too much to try a dry january to give it
mels/009717.pt|at haircut and a nail removal i need to get
mels/027331.pt|it's actually added many many ways that make it kind of a lot easier to beat

mels/004154.pt|well over a year ago you purchased a fedora for the nice guy undertale run

mels/001923.pt|like the team is great the work i'm doing is fun

mels/013313.pt|guys really don't connect with street performers on linkedin i think you just say it because i'm against it and you think that's funny i'm pretty sure
mels/015866.pt|that's that's the main difference and also
mels/002374.pt|this thing for three months a
mels/008891.pt|i have right now to vastly overpay for another company
mels/009378.pt|was on a champion he's never played before

mels/006037.pt|you weren't taking a lot of games man you got a lot better you got a lot better i'll give you that
mels/006486.pt|we are probably almost certainly actually i'm saying probably to be nice
mels/000545.pt|these are really nice watches and so we all have the different seasons i'm winter right here
mels/023107.pt|to imply that i a youtube raw could ever be influenced by marketing is pure insanity and to imply that i a youtube frog could ever be influenced by
mels/001563.pt|i pay the musician on discord for your fifty dollars thank you for playing
mels/024118.pt|come who are in the market for a car but
mels/007030.pt|this so i played a couple
mels/031897.pt|it out and he pulls out this big paper mache heart with her name on it and he's like bro i'm
mels/022185.pt|i can't imagine grandma winning the powerball is just buying
mels/012754.pt|what else on earth he but think about this so at one point he had i
mels/004649.pt|from that guy from the cold caller
mels/019364.pt|and i went in and i i spent all of our money and more i went into debt i spent all the money the
mels/013653.pt|the only one i am going to be the only mixer streamer i'm bringing it back okay that's right i spoke
mels/020347.pt|if the idea it's a really clever idea opening
mels/031238.pt|he was the best zerg player in history all right he was just a god of starcraft
mels/009711.pt|i have yet to notice any clever wordplay but i did notice
mels/028228.pt|as people so we got which is by the way
mels/014533.pt|we'll definitely disperse i think h rock is
mels/006149.pt|we been talking mad game about his
mels/009152.pt|bro if i feel like if i'm a person that loved elon musk and i see all of his
mels/025779.pt|women in leadership and she realized she
mels/013374.pt|actually the most ever this is the most tweets we've ever had on a best tweets and they are all
mels/001438.pt|not the worst answer possible what he it basically is right like i mean
mels/014578.pt|it's getting more dominant they're not going to pay
mels/024107.pt|that's what he said and so in response his team
mels/027328.pt|example i i thought of this fashion brands will literally destroy billions of their own merchandise to keep it scarce they don't sell it for cheaper they don't discount it they destroy it because if it were to be sold for clearance or for cheap over time that would make it less scarce and reduce the brand value of their product it's basically what
mels/016552.pt|now you can do it for less than a thousand
mels/003568.pt|i don't i'm i i don't think i'm
mels/009908.pt|survival depends on somebody looking at the
mels/013275.pt|it's nice that amazon has tried though currently not quite gotten there with the ability to just react to something with approval like all legal approvals with your chat prime watch parties are a good first step needs a little bit more a little bit more juice in the caboose
mels/017626.pt|previously when you buy electronics you would go to a place like best buy or
mels/026401.pt|this part of the clock has led to outsize
mels/016408.pt|and i want to explain a little bit of of of why it's so bad that it goes to these people specifically and it's an effect that i'm not
mels/016994.pt|when he's got a really fun story about kung fu panda that i that i enjoyed and i'm going to
mels/030653.pt|in the five and my dad shows up to pick me up
mels/010906.pt|if you type exclamation point minions a certain number of times
mels/002834.pt|if think basically the banks that have agreed to pay for his
mels/007105.pt|determined primarily by an algorithm then when you express a small amount of interest that can snowball to
mels/008815.pt|it's awful business move awfully bad but it's it's not
mels/022044.pt|was like yeah i think i'm
mels/023730.pt|that has no danger of falling out it came with six little size things when i got it i picked the large one i put it in it fits snugly i can use it at the gym i can use it when taking work calls

mels/012529.pt|you're getting into it and having a good time blast
mels/001771.pt|and to for our future generations
mels/024825.pt|is that you need to be able to get
mels/023806.pt|man reality shift reality shift out
mels/008326.pt|what everything's kind of normal i think that's the indicator if channel
mels/003401.pt|it's i have a what's up beijing but it
mels/008995.pt|but believe me i'm laughing so hard right now that i

mels/032236.pt|he places it on the field and it's gone all within the span of like a minute and a half that's like they robbed him if they had a gun they couldn't get it faster and i realized wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait are we the
mels/016533.pt|talking about three million dollars if you won
mels/012131.pt|and then like ari's like what's going on
mels/006113.pt|as like nine sets one of his biggest opponents uh in a big tournament
mels/029362.pt|so i order like a big pasta like a the rigatoni and a drink you know i dunno i or i want to fit i don't want to order to like the can so i order like a big pasta like a pasta rigatoni and a drink you know i don't know i want

mels/002439.pt|i feel like i'm i'm getting getting to
mels/026524.pt|that being said someone who i never liked is steve aoki who did this
mels/030527.pt|you didn't hear it from me i
mels/027946.pt|one share for a dollar you can do that and then see
mels/023047.pt|some things which allowed for google and firefox
mels/010678.pt|no cursing limits how hard could the boss possibly be
mels/018495.pt|dwarfing all of this by a massive factor was bethesda and all of its games in perpetuity bethesda and zenimax for seven and a half billion
mels/005914.pt|i don't even no i didn't i didn't
mels/009929.pt|you guys have asked me that every time about
mels/018136.pt|this is what kendall jenner wanted
mels/025069.pt|which is nothing to nestle and everything to ethiopia nestle makes a billion dollars a year on
mels/016373.pt|using fake ids to apply for loans for fake businesses they texted about the cash that was available you need to apply
mels/013668.pt|in worse than mixer but then you hit me up with atriox tube
mels/026352.pt|stuff has gotten they've clearly stolen a
mels/031888.pt|the first girl i was thinking about asking to
mels/003607.pt|the uh i'm a recent grad i live
mels/020234.pt|with their account that's really funny i mean normally they'd be like okay what happened here obviously this is trolling we're going to go with perry like i
mels/004404.pt|and thank you for reaching out
mels/025632.pt|up on revenue they're making more money than ever but they're spending more money than ever the war is expensive and so in
mels/027802.pt|the way that we got out of it was
mels/003253.pt|dollar contribution that becomes ten thousand
mels/024479.pt|and they include a joke about he
mels/012995.pt|a little while and you actually learn it
mels/025870.pt|that is like a 2002 way
mels/001278.pt|it is funny that when i was a kid i would watch fear factor with joe rogan and now many years later he's like the biggest
mels/015621.pt|and it did not seem to did not seem expected
mels/003000.pt|she's by that front exit like she can see down
mels/020708.pt|why are life and as a marketer i'm disgusted also as a person
mels/001147.pt|one of the did you already drink it
mels/004873.pt|if the world and he is demanding in all hands emails that every single person comes into the office for
mels/016970.pt|do that i think i will do a shark tank but i'm gonna need a little bit of a break i'm
mels/022921.pt|however cross-platform play is not a slam dunk no matter the size of the title basically saying don't get
mels/009010.pt|yeah would do actually is play fall guys with chat uh oh
mels/008807.pt|that billion dollar back out fee is like if an act of god comes in and this deal cannot go through for whatever reason i mean whatever crazy reason
mels/021049.pt|it actually in my mind the this is
mels/003384.pt|what a joke yeah they grabbed his finger and
mels/018169.pt|everybody pepsi drink pepsi pepsi only my choice
mels/016502.pt|one became like the third biggest company in the world
mels/008417.pt|go and we just yeah it's a
mels/022187.pt|i've mentioned this before so there's an art to using puppies and dogs in advertisements okay
mels/007122.pt|that masks were no longer required and it's like okay look i understand that we're two years into a pandemic
mels/007551.pt|over and over come phantom yeah yeah
mels/007747.pt|ludwig said you were super fast is there
mels/008100.pt|he sticks with us through thick and thin and that's true
mels/013107.pt|a little late sure sure okay i wanted to eat dinner with ari i wanted to get all the tweets ready did i do both these things
mels/031106.pt|because the time is coming you know he i
mels/031830.pt|i tell you so what that means
mels/001324.pt|this guy's legit no i believe it i
mels/004462.pt|later years even later years when he needs the money and he sells out
mels/004559.pt|welcome to marketing monday on a monday for once
mels/028332.pt|ben sw wins okay now i think it's
mels/011594.pt|and then i was like black and
mels/031348.pt|and i'm hoping she'll be lenient and let me off but there's like these shoplifting
mels/020608.pt|it sounded studio quality too and that
mels/000940.pt|you are aware of the glizzy hands meme
mels/026692.pt|they get the hundred million dollars twitch makes no money back almost no money back it's a big disaster okay but the
mels/024581.pt|well there's just no way to stop it and so that's a pretty much a massive l because not only did epic games have to spend a
mels/025249.pt|and then i guess we will do the most hated brands and that of course goes to nintendo i haven't been able to talk about nintendo's direct
mels/005748.pt|and like it's almost like there's a meter i think i think it was either a sauna
mels/017864.pt|is how you can build your brand and stand out in the gaming world and people only focus on this and this is the only this is like the best way to trick consumers and this is the best way to get them to become
mels/013258.pt|your mode challenge everyone's doing what is that someone like me conor got
mels/019608.pt|song become a number one hit as
mels/014841.pt|it was hotly anticipated and then they announced
mels/007294.pt|i don't have it um listen throughout the so from the
mels/027432.pt|i thought was extra funny because it said
mels/028407.pt|well as project and if the person who owns that project
mels/028700.pt|and at one of those tournaments
mels/018885.pt|well let's let's close the street
mels/019362.pt|and i was like jason i have the password
mels/012849.pt|i kick it literally saved my life like if he hadn't if this event hadn't been
mels/015415.pt|by disney plus and gets all that for free for one fee they're making way less money off you
mels/020901.pt|your parents will tell you that they think this is the good investment advice buy a house get a starter home real estate is not a good place to start building your your investment okay if you have if you have rich parents or
mels/010628.pt|it's the yellow buff it does speed it's for the
mels/024503.pt|up being a pretty strong appeal for apple so no it was not a big win for the free
mels/022832.pt|so instead of owning all of a big media company he gave up over half of his company
mels/023428.pt|it it it almost seems to work out
mels/002489.pt|i would absolutely backfire if every lace bag in america wrote
mels/018448.pt|these guys i mean this would be crazy but what if
mels/022398.pt|what did she say i understood none of
mels/002927.pt|if you'd like it to be so i'm interested to see if it really builds a franchise or
mels/008761.pt|my twitter bid succeeds we will defeat the
mels/029226.pt|i like behind the scenes you know behind the stage
mels/028983.pt|gummy bears i didn't feel hungry i just felt sick so
mels/013136.pt|i was talking about this with a riot employee
mels/005687.pt|carl jacobs was playing fall guys with him
mels/018051.pt|we need to get there immediately but look what's happened according to reports i
mels/026291.pt|for example nike is a company
mels/004535.pt|and they all seem fantastic i'm sure none of them are stupid but due to time constraints and the fact that i have a guest i'm going to jump into wins and phil let me
mels/013683.pt|we are talking about the streaming war between twitch and youtube what it means who's winning how we got here but first we open as always with some wins and fails in the past week of business and marketing starting with a major win for exactly five minutes to twitter shareholders because ceo of twitter jack dorsey finally stepped down to take a roll as gandalf in lord of the rings
mels/024329.pt|it's company changed their name to aviva
mels/014961.pt|i could deduct um everything i spend on quack
mels/027226.pt|this is this is more um
mels/031599.pt|wife and i was so nervous you can just hear it i was so nervous and team liquid said they would they would they would pay for my accommodations
mels/026589.pt|fuck with ninja turtle recording device and if she does it's a lot more invasive okay a
mels/025471.pt|they did not get out of uh groups
mels/025124.pt|if the topic on marketing monday before that we have to get to our wins and fails this ad is a fail
mels/000627.pt|profound you know i was like
mels/007689.pt|they record in the morning oh yeah i usually do every day i stream during the best
mels/014219.pt|when people leave twitch it doesn't hurt twitch because while twitch's viewership numbers
mels/016595.pt|big tech clients big big corporate clients
mels/030425.pt|the photographer was like seemed like an ex-spy like
mels/030394.pt|in this bag i need you like please please please do not pull it out i i have no problem with you checking my
mels/013723.pt|instead of just banning him they sued him they
mels/017249.pt|tend to be steve jobs create a fake blood testing company
mels/027508.pt|seven years to go nowhere and ended up lower than that twitter has made no progress while even facebook and snapchat and tick tock continue to bring in massive revenue facebook while you know
mels/016100.pt|well definitely say yes to the promo
mels/006817.pt|yeah prime you can watch it with me live i'll probably do like an episode a day
mels/028417.pt|was a little kid he was he was he just
mels/028344.pt|and in a very very very unfortunate turn of events
mels/023106.pt|in different ways call it something new know you are lying to
mels/023830.pt|we have more hilarious ads to watch but
mels/002579.pt|or six if you get this number i will give you one hundred dollars flat straight up there is no catch one hundred dollars flat if you don't get it i'm sorry we have to go to the next person you did fail the
mels/031124.pt|harder than most of them are
mels/020268.pt|you know i'm on vacation i
mels/029010.pt|is a week mango drinks every day
mels/004211.pt|just a minute probably in three minutes we're
mels/025477.pt|the big mouse company's market share by being a little bit more nimble around
mels/031788.pt|insular they did not connect to the main world there's small crossover with the
mels/015225.pt|on netflix because you're going to reach so many more people you'll be a
mels/029698.pt|wang friendlies and i was i was like taking some
mels/024965.pt|uber is the most hated brand in america canada
mels/015291.pt|and they're not stopping there so look at this
mels/011622.pt|lord of the rings she'd never even heard of it and i i had her watch the trilogy
mels/020373.pt|weird tension between the two this is given a one i
mels/012341.pt|the threw me out i was really pissed about that actually especially from the guy whose home planet was mexico
mels/027888.pt|why would you pay rent in a mall when you could set up your business online and sell direct but it turns out over the past few years as it's become more
mels/005384.pt|to that we'll get to streamers and being socially awkward in in a minute there's there's a lot to say i think they're cool by the way i think they're cool again
mels/006464.pt|and that fail is um how do i say this okay when you look
mels/004472.pt|what i'll do is they'll ask me if i
mels/017160.pt|final run of enron hats will be available for sale
mels/011732.pt|employees is a gen z theater kid okay then there are the actual actors and i'll get to those guys in a minute but
mels/005287.pt|while working all the time so i
mels/011007.pt|wall guys if there's a squad for fall guys i can do that
mels/013242.pt|let me know that there's going to be a mario striker's brawl masters invitational
mels/010029.pt|you could say that at any time
mels/011809.pt|in the first scene i see i go out and it's
mels/028043.pt|there are publicizing it all over to try and scare stores
mels/013005.pt|whether you know for the rest of the year yeah you'd
mels/018070.pt|i i'm pretty sure it didn't pretty
mels/002373.pt|trying to get back on schedule i totally
mels/010866.pt|that's actually awesome dude i would love dude that's actually
mels/011536.pt|but as i look out among the sea of
mels/010997.pt|what a attempt to do the balloons boss write
mels/025674.pt|it could get your brand in trouble as in this
mels/007802.pt|well with my picture is jake hurwitz saying cheeky streamer
mels/027437.pt|whoa feels good baby that's all it takes to beat the landlords back that's a good segue because speaking of not effective marketing it is a fail on behalf of taco bell and i suppose a win on behalf of
mels/007922.pt|profile picture so it's fine looks like you used your
mels/026433.pt|do this to have loud uh
mels/010094.pt|they're awesome they're very very delicious i really really enjoy them and i always request them in the box
mels/029002.pt|and i could just cough and you would just be out of
mels/014628.pt|the creator and you make a great video you can get a million views that is that is hard to do that is a quality
mels/006283.pt|guy named anonymous that was me i wanted to buy it so i could burn it
mels/025741.pt|we don't do it all which is
mels/018698.pt|that's not enough they have to grow at least 10 percent they
mels/020556.pt|game that i really like that would probably give
mels/017706.pt|one of the highest nps scores which is a net promoter score a chance of someone recommending the brand after
mels/025184.pt|i was thinking this would be a really nice
mels/007389.pt|with the scene that's my that's my
mels/008129.pt|i think one of the reasons ari is so
mels/012060.pt|it was like the most pandering
mels/000346.pt|for the guy running the place we looked
mels/001250.pt|one person which is this woman right here and maybe she's good at
mels/002685.pt|wait a minute wait a minute i've already agreed to it which is a problem but i don't think this makes a
mels/020094.pt|he's forced out of the company and he ends up
mels/026006.pt|we making or inventing anything then sexism is
mels/022392.pt|how cool this guy is rub off on your brand and
mels/005764.pt|a good deal with but it was again i
mels/000516.pt|for the just like the bachelor
mels/020168.pt|their latest product a new belt or
mels/015497.pt|that's the long and short of it if netflix if disney can prove
mels/026445.pt|the end of my stream when everyone spams atrox
mels/015615.pt|the jungle and dominates anything in
mels/007136.pt|tossing it away like you'll never use it
mels/027779.pt|at the do we're going to talk about everything i'm
mels/028123.pt|not really well established like face is actually very long slow expensive process but for a while during the
mels/026712.pt|they get to all exit right around here bobby
mels/026398.pt|interact with a brand beyond the clock that
mels/023808.pt|what are you doing in the dark
mels/005006.pt|he agreed to buy the company at
mels/028582.pt|we just took the money he made me and i'll take that dude that's super
mels/026063.pt|what marvel okay because new data has shown that over
mels/007999.pt|it's in my chat sorry ari
mels/007208.pt|then eight months passed he never he never messed me again apparently he
mels/031321.pt|water bottle i just didn't get it finally two cops get there and then they
mels/001890.pt|it's hanging on by a goddamn thread what do
mels/021457.pt|it's not that many shares if there's only a few shares they trade for a lot if there's a lot of shares they trade
mels/021144.pt|so to me given the problems they were probably facing and their goal this ads effective
mels/026166.pt|if this will save blizzard thank god riot is quaking in their boots
mels/026614.pt|billion dollars absurd amount of money in the gaming space it is by far the largest acquisition in gaming history in fact i have created a little chart to explain it to you these are the
mels/014221.pt|new streamer if you're like a person who's like tomorrow
mels/028342.pt|now he's like focused now he's focused and
mels/017343.pt|at the my paycheck my dad worked for amazon at a warehouse
mels/002501.pt|in one of them's called something star space
mels/014784.pt|it's just a great way to separate your stuff it also has easy way to track all your expenses it has easy way to send and
mels/004387.pt|speaking of twitter that i got a dm today that just made me
mels/008834.pt|the oh yeah you want back out of
mels/009137.pt|i know half of them are just elon
mels/030333.pt|one thing facebook's good for other than radicalizing the elderly it's
mels/009316.pt|isn't that like is very acceptable
mels/008378.pt|i had to call a bunch of
mels/015895.pt|even this is getting review like the government is like hey whoa whoa
mels/001703.pt|worried about i was worried you would go in this
mels/023644.pt|pride ally are billboards actually worth it it's so weird i just i literally i'm not kidding i'm
mels/032346.pt|but suddenly was able to clear presumably all of it in a moderately more than a few hours at most there's a lot more
mels/009502.pt|yes exactly you get stuck inside that zone you're going to be locked down rushes
mels/025346.pt|this guy was on the set and i literally
mels/001716.pt|his short stories are dark he's a good writer but you'd think when
mels/016664.pt|being the one that surprise supplies and build
mels/031845.pt|his hair and ninja's not in it
mels/012796.pt|are people and we did some tournaments but we were paid like in
mels/027123.pt|which of money basically doing massive bailouts flooding the
mels/005991.pt|and it's so annoying they like white knight
mels/012819.pt|if the and bigger and then we were super excited
mels/009854.pt|in terms of land and build gigantic sprawling parking lots in every direction
mels/031577.pt|you start to hear it like wait
mels/019476.pt|impactful ads and both times people listened as
mels/013168.pt|it's where i watch something with chat but i am sort of with my energy and aura responding to it okay i don't react reacting is cringe i respond okay and i want you guys to
mels/012570.pt|when i like got the sponsorship they made me like an
mels/020629.pt|everybody hated it and they ended up having to take it down what a bad bad
mels/003643.pt|our current economic system outside of money and politics
mels/019990.pt|after heroes you don't even own yet you can't use them they
mels/030751.pt|the sweetest mother they got it right maya they got it right
mels/019604.pt|the german agency delivered the tagline i'm loving it and also the five syllable sound signature
mels/021950.pt|okay one thing that has been very clear in my mind and a good way to think about how to be strategic in your life is what is something hard i can do that most other people won't now the famous amazon example is this if you are running a business and someone in the
mels/030068.pt|hey you pikachu is coming out and things are going to change around here okay things are this is going to be my life now
mels/004634.pt|anyway i got one today and
mels/023494.pt|technically all months at ford are truck
mels/001227.pt|in the field and looking around at the
mels/024105.pt|chief marketing officer of hyundai said
mels/023932.pt|and then my final dub and this is a marketing monday after all goes to a man who

mels/000835.pt|inter with eight guys from craigslist one of them smoked crack at
mels/031098.pt|and i remember seeing that like the way money on twitch works is not a straight line let me draw it for you people think it's like this people think it's like this like this is this is the money and this is the subs subs and
mels/021880.pt|in cars in front of him

mels/010364.pt|six seven hours 12 hours of balloons it's
mels/003669.pt|but because of the fact that the son of the
mels/024110.pt|are you ready are you ready
mels/011831.pt|it's a big star wars fan and we needed a two day
mels/016703.pt|to trends are becoming massive one is remote work among corporations that can afford it because they don't
mels/011873.pt|is that it's not about a relaxing two-day
mels/003086.pt|one understandable unfortunately there's not a ton of great economic news that i can throw in the wins and fails so
mels/028149.pt|also on their ability to get the deal through which is bad because they were relying on some of the cash that was in that boring company when they merged they get the cashes in the boring company and
mels/015031.pt|and they'll send you another movie from your list
mels/018092.pt|the landing in the desert this these problems are too serious for pepsi man to handle this is soldiers in a crashed helicopter whoa whoa
mels/010761.pt|so well made and funny and heartfelt and good that it's hard not to like it if you watch the whole thing
mels/022684.pt|what she didn't understand was the sheer amount of porn on the website as well
mels/007520.pt|large coffee cup filled with sour candy and it was a surreal experience it was surreal it was a surreal experience i've never had that happen ever
mels/016006.pt|and every other company when you say that they're like
mels/029489.pt|at the disabled people so much and that
mels/014705.pt|to be like a black like black tie you know i don't want any of you wearing like hoodies or something
mels/026188.pt|if dividends for riot all of their games
mels/004821.pt|the speech on twitter about um
mels/027834.pt|that means not in parentheses you're looking at a company that at the very least makes sense it's it's like what
mels/000238.pt|is the antagonist so if we're winning we're
mels/011073.pt|comment you know no not even a little broom
mels/031655.pt|definitely feels awkward though right because he's got his
mels/025856.pt|the credits and like to travel for the blizzard
mels/004314.pt|we can make fun of them
mels/012197.pt|anyway she does she just lets
mels/006165.pt|glad i wore the enron rush to mogul
mels/013244.pt|it's got a certain level of
mels/020875.pt|was like yo these places are getting more and more risky every year so insurance rates go up
mels/027945.pt|if you want to buy like 0.01

mels/018542.pt|is a service to sell toilet paper it's a service to make you hooked into amazon prime so
mels/007893.pt|anyway that was funny uh thank you for
mels/010322.pt|i knew that when i asked chad i would get
mels/010812.pt|the night repeat family friend i've only
mels/005556.pt|we were we were there again we showed up
mels/029577.pt|being able to simplify it down to like these cool different styles is a
mels/016820.pt|tailwinds it's doing quite well so
mels/030423.pt|who like was like street smart
mels/012148.pt|it's override they're like yeah we're gonna
mels/011457.pt|i don't i don't do that that's not simple plan made a banger intro for
mels/030695.pt|i wasn't like the kind of guy who'd have
mels/018722.pt|i can't do that dude so if you
mels/015255.pt|a bill it's like electricity it's like it's like water electricity
mels/015376.pt|well they're just very good at talent
mels/024276.pt|i'm going to give that i mean i think it's it's got kia in it so i think it's better than the last one but it was odd the reason it was so expensive is clear they had to
mels/011351.pt|in the quote to include like
mels/008623.pt|i really like twitter especially as a management
mels/008602.pt|i got it right here i got actually i have the document right here let me
mels/007635.pt|at the seven hour elden ring video too
mels/016496.pt|years ago you're probably going to do better than someone who
mels/018874.pt|i read it read it read it write
mels/005000.pt|and have evidence that you knew about any bots um we're
mels/031266.pt|we had like two groups of mutualists you can
mels/013408.pt|look like he's got a youthful boyish spirit to him you know what i'm saying this is the one case i believe this is a rare moment this is the one case where an animated character would have been better voiced by chris pratt
mels/008732.pt|and so and like there's a lot of precedent that
mels/028318.pt|games and he starts playing smash 4. and he's
mels/001629.pt|that's not what we want to do
mels/006926.pt|for your mind one time for your mind ow
mels/027847.pt|just because it's hot and there's a lot of funding versus the ones that
mels/020976.pt|see you guys han out here
mels/023572.pt|some thoughts for you and helped
mels/013913.pt|willing to talk about i like to end the
mels/004826.pt|and what was even better than that is that immediately following this
mels/028952.pt|cause i would be like the the foreign exchange
mels/020329.pt|five as in a perfect ad i do not think this
mels/020997.pt|monkey business sales aren't up there they're down
mels/014579.pt|i pay creators to leave they do it now they
mels/016400.pt|his money went to the wrong people and uh it might seem like this doesn't
mels/030589.pt|i knew that this country has more
mels/013250.pt|when your career nobody makes it on
mels/021657.pt|i feel like a much of a breakthrough
mels/012233.pt|we both have four cards it's an
mels/006891.pt|which i wasn't blue bottle coffee i think was one they
mels/029858.pt|it's bobby's laughing the whole way through
mels/003760.pt|i have to get rid of that
mels/012231.pt|and then he flips over and i flip over
mels/017366.pt|does happen that's insane that is insane
mels/017104.pt|that would be a wild one that would get me that would give me pause
mels/006143.pt|if the thing to say lyrics been nothing but nice lyric even
mels/021942.pt|okay what the logo looks like or you know
mels/027740.pt|if that didn't make me love
mels/006004.pt|with the best fox in the world oh judgment's
mels/001381.pt|yes it's a it's a and your
mels/028371.pt|as many times in a row as you can some business meetings
mels/008356.pt|where we just have a lot of jobs
mels/017781.pt|and it would be stupid to
mels/008590.pt|i want to get paid that much money for my
mels/012033.pt|and he just tells you what to do
mels/016430.pt|people get distracted by whatever the latest
mels/004173.pt|the plan figure out the plan seamlessly how
mels/026313.pt|apple is a company that sells the
mels/012389.pt|so we we get to the
mels/003372.pt|the guys don't know magnus carlsen basically dropped out of the world chess championship basically saying he no longer wants to compete at the highest level for chess he's done he's won for
mels/029433.pt|i really liked me if i did one thing right it was like get on this guy's good side and like convince him that i was a hustler trying
mels/021968.pt|at nine years old jeff bezos young jeff bezos saw a commercial on tv talking about how smoking is bad for you and how each puff of a cigarette takes two minutes off your life now jeff bezos as you might expect was a little nerd he liked math okay he liked doing calculations and his grandma smoked so he's in the car with his grandmother and he's like oh i've got a plan
mels/001781.pt|as with any other employees you understand me higher yeah is that mr wonka
mels/032421.pt|it's more important to dodge to get greedy
mels/027503.pt|lot of terms like poison pill and yadda yadda
mels/020419.pt|with the iconic because you're the customer and
mels/024888.pt|at work continue with bonus and that's that's the psychological principle and
mels/004923.pt|as itself in anticipation of being taken over and
mels/009987.pt|hell yeah you know what team novak
mels/018751.pt|i think they raised the price still
mels/019876.pt|those are huge and you don't have enough and so okay let's get the number
mels/018271.pt|prince favorite car commercial we're gonna
mels/016236.pt|in today's topic i'll just tell you ahead of time today's topic is about the future it is about things that are going to change the world and perhaps
mels/028393.pt|his stream okay we might act globally but we think globally okay remember that
mels/012472.pt|cool everyone had a good time um
mels/026111.pt|the fired strikers they were flooded with fake job applications by
mels/028282.pt|oh bennett's w story okay i have a good
mels/021129.pt|the roof is behind the times it it's not
mels/032061.pt|looked over edited you know make sure
mels/006882.pt|and then he was tipping the dealer more than my salary like over the course of that night i
mels/024290.pt|especially at the end it seems a little on the nose or not subtle enough to have them say and they
mels/030731.pt|the fiance's name okay i'm sensing a pattern yeah you got that one ari i think
mels/004805.pt|we has no the way the
mels/000803.pt|the wallet the fatter the confidence on the gambling
mels/024866.pt|and of their income it's from targeting these
mels/025623.pt|anyway that's a fail that was a fail i'm
mels/024671.pt|sorry brother anyone who tells you they know
mels/023789.pt|every single time i do my boot
mels/004709.pt|except of course across the nation this great nation and world were playing the greatest album of all time the
mels/027237.pt|that is causing a unique brand to emerge and so um this kind of summed it up
mels/022823.pt|the internet we don't really get it
mels/014291.pt|what wait wait hold hold hold hold hold
mels/030438.pt|we get to the valentine's day and
mels/031100.pt|let's go up your money goes up it is not like this it is more like this let's use a red one like straight
mels/017645.pt|alpha million dollars to open but
mels/031166.pt|don't donate if you can't afford it
mels/011146.pt|see a real nft because it's not in the
mels/008425.pt|far more important for your future it is for sure for sure no one's
mels/008997.pt|more than they used to i'm watching you guys i'm seeing a swift uptick in i can't it's not quite little w's level yet but
mels/025559.pt|they immediately had a tractor crash the non-union salaried workers a lot of
mels/024660.pt|what we could call a global financial crisis
mels/004232.pt|because i had so many videos
mels/019872.pt|every year to add new content it has 20 years of content
mels/000413.pt|all the casino it's basically war it's basically two cards
mels/028408.pt|it goes oh well you know the
mels/001784.pt|okay well we've locked that in
mels/012974.pt|his failings for their kids feelings but
mels/016007.pt|but with amazon they were like we'll be
mels/008984.pt|i think so there should be something there should
mels/025062.pt|i use sugary nestle formula they specifically gave people a free a month of free
mels/014692.pt|is your server so true king so
mels/002684.pt|sit here and i'm gonna make you a bunch of money
mels/010084.pt|it's been awesome it's been a real
mels/009434.pt|i just give it a second to be honest if i'm
mels/029407.pt|one that i was like kidnapped and the ransom was 20 bucks
mels/022695.pt|that number was completely pulled out of
mels/013000.pt|reinforcement like you had to like sit down and try it until you learned it
mels/027532.pt|can say with quite confidence that twitter management has been underperforming they also made what could be called one of the worst the single worst social media business decision of all time which is
mels/024306.pt|or sang at what point but outside of that
mels/011580.pt|we just throw it up right what's
mels/007710.pt|if you could reverse men in black a language it's crazy i know exactly what you mean reverse men in black you mean like someone is a flashy thingy and suddenly
mels/007162.pt|is the people you you grew up with and
mels/020335.pt|to be a fobner success wasn't just
mels/013963.pt|as a little bit but it's very uh hard
mels/026138.pt|and i again i don't compliment roblox on much
mels/023589.pt|marketing and that's dunking on stupid
mels/027445.pt|i was spending millions of dollars to get her to do this
mels/002220.pt|if you've been listening to what i've been saying
mels/004510.pt|from me to you couldn't mean it more if i tried and
mels/017040.pt|so we're on the same page yeah that that tracks
mels/011095.pt|it's message do you really care
mels/027040.pt|this is definitely the most expensive overall for what they're selling
mels/023291.pt|so he got there he picked up both
mels/011443.pt|the willingness to reach beyond your current limit stretch
mels/027136.pt|and if you want to juice the economy a little bit if things are rough let's say we have a big housing crisis what you can do is you can lower the interest rate when interest rates are high like if you have money sitting in a bank you'll get you'll get a lot
mels/008774.pt|right here so this is uh this is a guy
mels/024301.pt|i was a great ad i was genuinely funny
mels/002131.pt|no shot i mean yang might
mels/023022.pt|oh and then this part was a pretty good argument because look here's the deal apple sony nintendo google samsung they all take
mels/031280.pt|i'm getting scared because he's going to
mels/028818.pt|for me was like i died
mels/021725.pt|you might spend a little extra money for some bonus fake comments and
mels/023070.pt|what the competition and when there's a lot of competition between products that are essentially indistinguishable they serve the same need okay your hunger the only way they can differentiate themselves
mels/010150.pt|and i made the mistake of promising that i'd get pepper sprayed so okay
mels/001571.pt|death valley is the hottest place in the world
mels/027583.pt|that's what olive garden makes twitter is
mels/016134.pt|my i got the you know my uh i got
mels/019074.pt|has emotions you're not like oh my god you're acting okay you don't really have those emotions you're an actor playing a
mels/013916.pt|i don't know how many of you guys know about this but i'm sure based on demographics a lot of you do are you aware in my chat of an app called klarna who here knows about klarna
mels/026544.pt|but why are they doing that why is this
mels/006555.pt|get it but i'm just saying it's not free money so if you're poor and you spend
mels/000316.pt|everybody's winning um everybody's making money we're having
mels/008879.pt|what that they shoot no no no
mels/005868.pt|i did have a conversation with
mels/023301.pt|like less than a full euro
mels/022730.pt|only two years after owning the company that had lasted forever they fired
mels/012509.pt|it's all time so i guess if you assume i didn't gamble
mels/011570.pt|in the day dude i finished streaming 11
mels/021185.pt|or even broker okay this is a bad trend people
mels/029490.pt|like because then you're like okay well
mels/012196.pt|very cool thing and come down to the basement so you can lose
mels/021698.pt|i'm going to stick with my gut and put it pretty solid so this one's
mels/022000.pt|rallying behind it so i'm not so sure
mels/009627.pt|the melee series and then played the next 10
mels/017108.pt|i know what major you're going
mels/027842.pt|i'm not going to tell you that's leads to go up i'm not going to tell you that something's going to go up or down
mels/015256.pt|it's something that you don't necessarily think about it's uh it's just something that
mels/031643.pt|you decide okay i can't say that i also remember the one thing that got again i was super nervous here again as
mels/030670.pt|i don't even know how to say
mels/032334.pt|the on radiance over four stream sessions
mels/005115.pt|well it couldn't hurt you know frame
mels/008430.pt|it could be a funny youtube video
mels/021859.pt|interesting maybe i had some good ideas i just um little zoomer
mels/009856.pt|yeah colleges are like that i mean college towns are often like that because people don't have cars
mels/023547.pt|what hooked on uber you raise the price
mels/021307.pt|viewership is starting to get really big
mels/005269.pt|i don't even i don't even really i just i'm a really good
mels/006901.pt|i literally i would i wanted to go to work because i lived in a
mels/030132.pt|so i had to like literally when my dad
mels/027045.pt|but i want to tell you so ari is a really big
mels/031571.pt|at home so he abandons his own base flash desperately trying to defend
mels/006422.pt|you open up the elder chains online and feel a rush of excitement your buddy from school
mels/004983.pt|in the moon they just keep losing money it it continually goes down and again there's no utility to this coin it's not being adopted
mels/023850.pt|actually think the design is fine but where they're getting into trouble is that they change the taste and so there's beginning to be a backlash from i mean people that like coke zero sugar apparently and diet coke and all those really like it so what i'm hearing is they might be getting into a new coke situation now i think the new
mels/031172.pt|i think that's the dopest thing is that he hit the record he wanted the record and he got it he's now
mels/012318.pt|you know what i'm saying and by the way there was space pizza there was space
mels/001341.pt|or anything but it is beautiful and fun and it's paradise okay well i'm
mels/028826.pt|well apartment where you could basically live in this office and that's what i did i never left the office
mels/011289.pt|the time and it's okay yeah
mels/022363.pt|now i don't have a very high bar for soap but
mels/023719.pt|what of these commercials they get a little bit too clever and
mels/015268.pt|the intro that quack got me
mels/027910.pt|generally it's elevated prices due to a couple reasons that we'll see how they
mels/010424.pt|who said sincerely and remember i
mels/028843.pt|the nap room but it was like a terrible
mels/026709.pt|the leadership all of the owners of uh
mels/021428.pt|what they don't take the money so how do they make money
mels/008097.pt|very much man oh my gosh 50. that's crazy
mels/026150.pt|much into it but i think people that are obsessed with
mels/000713.pt|something like bro i've always loved you
mels/016686.pt|in the middle but by 2030 about
mels/016362.pt|trillion dollars in pandemic assistance for struggling americans small businesses and
mels/007221.pt|incredibly low for where he got
mels/030572.pt|my one year will be in may my one year of streaming
mels/023926.pt|his reactions through expressions when he's impressed or happy you can see it in his face
mels/026600.pt|it's january 20th with new episodes every
mels/019557.pt|it just hear what was going on in his life when he created the autozone
mels/031441.pt|he goes farther so the farther you go down this beach
mels/026788.pt|sort of thought about acquiring or
mels/021028.pt|in southwest fares as low as 59
mels/007835.pt|for what i said it was funny
mels/021826.pt|the the things about jeff bezos and his colossal
mels/023346.pt|it's golf stuff and so a disc golf manufacturer will pay him almost any amount of money because they target the exact market they want it's it's a win for both and so
mels/021537.pt|what we don't talk about is that there's there's other smaller hedge funds that are also jumping on board this money train to try and squeeze the big guys out of shorts and they're putting in millions is it possible those hedge funds losing all their money crashes the market because
mels/007757.pt|rather than i just i just ran like a decent speed
mels/025804.pt|where somebody asked the question who's better rider
mels/027491.pt|a media company but what i think was a very very good take that sort of
mels/021079.pt|as are not buying condos let's be real
mels/031000.pt|and i thought it was funny i mean
mels/012068.pt|the experience for both me and
mels/029473.pt|hey here's an email of somebody you should look up that the
mels/024424.pt|what's been done so i want to show you this jeep billboard from i believe the
mels/020790.pt|i thought we could not even ourselves
mels/000787.pt|it's paid for the group he just balled out
mels/012086.pt|so but what's cool is like
mels/031351.pt|like legit a lot of community service like a
mels/029919.pt|and then peering over your shoulder
mels/000434.pt|but it doesn't matter because every time
mels/028397.pt|what to move the needle all the time as per my last email
mels/024972.pt|example but high up in the united states is lego lego is one of the quote unquote most hated brands due to this methodology and it's because people on social media were writing that they stepped on
mels/018684.pt|this is already flopped this is over so this plan has failed i should have a sidebar here where i say
mels/003589.pt|yeah that's a good way to explain it yeah a recession is like when ryan
mels/000323.pt|it's like you can actually move around it's
mels/007705.pt|that's a smart idea and then once i get really good at spanish
mels/024153.pt|it's funny that like ninja hit the
mels/006710.pt|not that funny dude it's not that funny dude it's
mels/024014.pt|because if they ever did get frozen they would not be able to pay out their top
mels/020702.pt|when it gets old still disgusting but the billboards were this this was the billboard
mels/005817.pt|i mean look i was talking
mels/021368.pt|this is ludwig stock wow he is worth a lot of money he's probably
mels/025341.pt|at the time so they were celebrating 20 years
mels/024393.pt|it's too much they could have gotten a similar effect for cheaper in fact i don't even think it needed to be nicole kidman my call is a thumbs down a bit of
mels/001196.pt|cup ramen they're simple affordable one
mels/029214.pt|for your 10 gifted thank you for the
mels/005264.pt|it is where it gets weird
mels/023566.pt|if you have different preferences okay what's especially amazing about digital goods is the cost is almost nothing the cost is so far down here so if they can price it like at 20 bucks
mels/007808.pt|we're gonna do that today regardless
mels/029174.pt|like a third of the entire website was twitch pokemon
mels/006899.pt|for twitch i lived at work how many times was i
mels/031164.pt|if the front about you know all the stuff that
mels/013758.pt|there's still thriving and there was a leak this week that proves that blizzard has exactly what it takes to take back the crown and that's why my win this week is blizzard
mels/025980.pt|well a new year with the same quality marketing monday
mels/008878.pt|if twitter sold for less to elon would
mels/026592.pt|is your more than they are
mels/011163.pt|she also likes my pit stains wait who's sitting over there who is sit who's sitting off stream
mels/021955.pt|but the unique thing about amazon's
mels/015115.pt|figure it out streaming but we don't own anything
mels/030470.pt|and then i the true facts all right facts we were
mels/023654.pt|it's like a cool it's like uh you know
mels/016051.pt|well you just put money in and invest
mels/010413.pt|and like a legal barrier to anyone else setting up a competition
mels/008828.pt|he's doing stuff for the environment like people
mels/019621.pt|or like a sanitation engineer in america it's like it's like almost yeah it's the moose with the
mels/027578.pt|if they'd been looking at it internally to make their case if they should get elon musk
mels/000163.pt|if the the tacky a guy then irritated whose work gets crazy we if the the tacky okay then
mels/006342.pt|if the for everything obviously all the stuff you've done for
mels/017413.pt|but some data has come out showing that gen z has the lowest usage of drugs and alcohol ever
mels/002050.pt|also say i'm not looking for nobody with
mels/023207.pt|juice it's not the juice you bought if you buy
mels/022861.pt|in the first people to turn negative on amazon that was the one example
mels/025556.pt|it because the work requires training so they got all their their
mels/015924.pt|so that's one thing i didn't mention that i probably should have is that one other advantage netflix has is they have a
mels/031835.pt|in this area to become the absolute dominant force of the hype
mels/022587.pt|at your nearest swimming pool and
mels/004630.pt|your the other day by the way okay i got a cold call
mels/018526.pt|better games microsoft is willing to spend their way out of that hole and
mels/030057.pt|oh sorry would you like passage
mels/018843.pt|marrying someone else that's not a crazy thing
mels/031077.pt|if viewers but you could tell that he was
mels/029078.pt|twitch staff or early games or early streamers
mels/020999.pt|the whole point of their business is that you think your job sucks you want to find a new job you go to
mels/006298.pt|content ideas and tips and how to format for youtube
mels/030880.pt|like three days and i'm spiraling because of it i feel like you are either like thriving or spiraling you're either like having yeah you're you're you're
mels/007213.pt|at the tournament and he said for sure i'll wear the enron
mels/020851.pt|on twitter time for a stiff drink and some truth you probably don't want to hear which starts off a little bit
mels/013832.pt|earning potential which is on brand for microsoft what are you
mels/026810.pt|putting in dent in them but
mels/029970.pt|he would love to have like an overcoming
mels/017221.pt|well marketing i'm talking of course about pabst blue ribbon which tweeted this morning not drinking this january try eating ass
mels/028400.pt|and i don't like you everyone knows it everyone on the reply all knows that if you say
mels/018185.pt|wait them and talk about them okay first one first one and then we're
mels/017798.pt|if the often with high impact high value sets it's one of the reasons i believe if
mels/002975.pt|this monster appears is right in front of the camera and then the power goes out
mels/023613.pt|they might ruin the performance and then just
mels/015600.pt|as a business not as a streaming service
mels/006494.pt|i do i don't like this
mels/000162.pt|really funny but we move on because he's a little bit
mels/018729.pt|it depends very much on sony's price if they can price close to
mels/031662.pt|this was like a tiny corner of the back of the event hall it was like massive starcraft stage massive counter-strike stage and a tiny
mels/017540.pt|height of its power when it had a standing army
mels/001076.pt|it's like okay quack that's so interesting it's like yeah that's crazy man the
mels/019914.pt|it's why i included it this ad is why
mels/030089.pt|i like screen i'm like scream i'm like
mels/003252.pt|was an investment opportunity early readers could spot the next big thing and make a hundred dollar
mels/003184.pt|is right at the time that the government is finally growing a pair of balls and kind of pushing some regulation on them right as they are already faltering so
mels/010700.pt|i say i didn't say that i didn't say a word no i
mels/009513.pt|what's your tournament this is i mean i'm not saying it's it's functionally impossible i'm just saying i rarely see it this is this looks like a sweep is
mels/001021.pt|have the same dog no you're lying you're
mels/024926.pt|and this quote made me so sad for the future of games
mels/006545.pt|the loan sharking and debt to average people has always been a very profitable
mels/005730.pt|and then i'll say this all right
mels/010514.pt|would it help coney if i told you
mels/004498.pt|you understand because by that line of thought then i could be wishing every single person
mels/019716.pt|the population that's eight that's 15
mels/023014.pt|this store where you could pay directly they basically said it we're doing it
mels/016196.pt|papa bezos might still need some cash
mels/021646.pt|it's for to consider buying evs
mels/005113.pt|hello hello hello now that pride month is over can we have ally month to commemorate big a's contribution
mels/005174.pt|did it cost per nail it's for a video
mels/019654.pt|a friend of mine he was like
mels/026561.pt|so we can sell the rights to netflix for some sort of
mels/024428.pt|in the back to the future movies but
mels/020376.pt|research shows people remember commercials with nostalgia so to help you remember that liberty mutual customizes your home insurance
mels/008882.pt|did he impregnated a twitter exec oh my god i
mels/030965.pt|do you get zits a truck
mels/017027.pt|about marketing with a girl now we're going on a second date no thinking about dumping her after two
mels/016247.pt|if they want to lost and it's
mels/021827.pt|well dragon hoarding amount of wealth that i do not support so if i highlight a few things that i think he's done right or has good ideas on that should not be considered a
mels/007390.pt|i just i just love mango and and i do
mels/008157.pt|well backstory on my who my boss and what
mels/022445.pt|see themselves everyone in chat who's like
mels/002593.pt|heads or tails heads or tails
mels/027964.pt|if the for fast fast and the furious
mels/020467.pt|first of all refunds so people say okay the
mels/002733.pt|incredibly generous deal you are now at
mels/025212.pt|do you can't call us anything but a win
mels/006898.pt|i don't think i was ever
mels/014756.pt|i reached out to him and
mels/008632.pt|using two dollars a day it helps you for a bit but unless you change the business structurally it's not you
mels/015513.pt|this is apple in the streaming wars it's like a hobby to them they're the most valuable company on
mels/015654.pt|you know there's there's there's money and there's that
mels/027373.pt|with a company taking home a rare double trophy win and a
mels/027810.pt|what it would lead to the bubble popping so they
mels/025665.pt|some of these but first before i do let me give
mels/008351.pt|we have so many recessions because
mels/032003.pt|im sorry and scar was very whipped at that dinner
mels/029107.pt|living out of my car living at
mels/002801.pt|without further ado i think it's time for wins
mels/020179.pt|is that really such a crime is that i
mels/026580.pt|always phone call phone call can you imagine if ninja called pokey
mels/013861.pt|gamers are liars they buy it because
mels/029707.pt|so you don't think you want any
mels/023064.pt|well food marketing is actually really really interesting and for one particular reason to me money that's why i'm interested in food marketing there's a lot more of it in food than in almost any other field of marketing and you're probably wondering why you're thinking
mels/001007.pt|you really you don't have to worry about it
mels/022717.pt|and essentially ran it into the nowhere it didn't go down
mels/024923.pt|fucking hate the guy but i've i've been here for 12 months what am i going to do
mels/020507.pt|that allowed them to turn a game where
mels/018011.pt|it was out most of sunday i
mels/015046.pt|it's more and more for netflix to send out these dvds at the same time broadband speeds got less and less expensive and
mels/025245.pt|chinese psychic for content oh no
mels/030843.pt|ben so i just want to make sure i i i have your question correct i want to make sure i understand completely what you're asking me so you're saying do you think my
mels/018909.pt|who could know what they want who's
mels/006075.pt|in catalog that's worth hundreds of
mels/019839.pt|and there's so much to do and there's so
mels/010237.pt|and always raise money for charity too
mels/004460.pt|at honest uh if you count
mels/011297.pt|the fall of an empire live
mels/028021.pt|i have been talking about for a while on what's going on
mels/027443.pt|calling it a jingle but i have to do a jingle they want me to rap about mexican pizza so i just want to give you a heads up before you
mels/015112.pt|i have ever seen this guy went on to become
mels/027708.pt|you can buy a percent of a share and it'll go up and down
mels/003650.pt|we destroyed enforcement and have so many loopholes on the estate tax
mels/013367.pt|key difference here's what makes this one of the most unique best tweets yet i have seen none of the tweets i'm
mels/018497.pt|this is how much this is how much sony made all year this is a
mels/007916.pt|i think almost all of them are
mels/002137.pt|something's up and i think is just the beginning i literally think people are
mels/006480.pt|and it is down we gotta help him out boys
mels/029973.pt|yeah but why are you live for an hour talking about why you're not going to do it when you could have just done
mels/030810.pt|there was a little game for kids like a fish game where you
mels/016762.pt|what which is like the united states it's basically a free cheat code to beat these demographic clips and and we're not using it and it's actually crazy and this applies to both trump and biden
mels/015222.pt|got a lot of talent let's say
mels/013372.pt|your reactions hopefully i don't get banned hopefully the adidas marketing tweet doesn't pop up
mels/012332.pt|but they were like okay you're
mels/026288.pt|and if you look back to the marketing model of like the 60s of the
mels/013065.pt|his business lived or died based on knowing it
mels/001386.pt|like there's not that many more right it
mels/006569.pt|worth it because we all know that the
mels/031669.pt|and i'm i'm like i'm like watching a
mels/007012.pt|of coffee he got me a giant venti phil's coffee and it was so
mels/005065.pt|just good judgment and you know generally except the
mels/022679.pt|for the ss yahoo here to be pulled by
mels/016274.pt|when and give a big win
mels/015053.pt|and they had a key advantage they were a first mover so let's one second
mels/026037.pt|wartime hiring of shipbuilders in world war ii amazon is
mels/028262.pt|type of person like literally they could not have given up like usually usually
mels/026713.pt|day and leave again this is the amount he stands to make i
mels/010830.pt|we have fearsome squad truly a fearsome squad
mels/025182.pt|be thinking about knees while i'm eating my
mels/022305.pt|that's gonna make it worse flash
mels/024986.pt|actually one of the best preachers of how strong
mels/015691.pt|is the streaming wars let's go back
mels/013204.pt|and tell me about history when i was alive
mels/002475.pt|but they were inventing like loyalty
mels/022820.pt|about half and so aol was like okay
mels/012919.pt|you know what is your contribution
mels/020989.pt|great humor funny characters and i love snickers candy as well that's a male
mels/012514.pt|if you had like a family of four you could fit in there or you
mels/004929.pt|i can't find a better offer they have to just stick around with elon musk and they've
mels/011596.pt|it's my brain just doesn't want to agree
mels/008248.pt|i really really influential and important in my life and he is going to be on the stream today and he's going to talk
mels/018238.pt|so we're gonna need a bigger one is that that's something huh okay i get that i'm
mels/028502.pt|i think almost by the next day he actually thought it was pretty funny so
mels/020456.pt|but no one can argue that this has been
mels/026107.pt|against kellogg's had great success what i was impressed about the kellogg strike is not only the strikers standing up for
mels/031446.pt|the waves are like sloshing stands
mels/029854.pt|im watching this video bobby you were like this is church we
mels/003575.pt|kind of attitude you know what i'm saying that's all
mels/021464.pt|if they would have lost literal billions so like whatever pr nightmare that robin hood gets it they they would rather take that hit than lose
mels/025244.pt|so that's a big l for chinese
mels/013996.pt|ship later how about that except i don't
mels/031931.pt|it's like a 30 minute limo ride and
mels/014776.pt|they are a pretty awesome new
mels/005185.pt|but he did it and it was uh and
mels/021672.pt|we know what they say when life gives you a
mels/013217.pt|in person who that you are the one person that i know for a fact has
mels/011869.pt|but it talks to you and the thing is it's like part of a story so what i finally what i realize it's like a
mels/006032.pt|it was crazy it was like dude i was like dude are you
mels/012255.pt|it he goes hey i have lightsaber training can you play for me in the finals
mels/014102.pt|i have a problem with um tabs
mels/009887.pt|would it be destroyed by climate change and so but what that means is billionaires

mels/025155.pt|it's okay wait wait wait you can't see this
mels/022328.pt|about it if there's like news articles picking up on it and you get a million more eyeballs that way it's called earned media and it's hard to get
mels/017796.pt|want to keep it going and then finally he competes
mels/023473.pt|to make so they have a gigantic margin but pretty low market share
mels/018068.pt|he cannot catch a break this
mels/021353.pt|am not because i'm actually quite pissed off and in fact i'm pretty sure this stock would have still zoomed today
mels/015647.pt|four year in business they are losing tons of money and they could make a bunch of money by selling like if they just sold survivor to netflix they'd make a
mels/014546.pt|a young otto's got many years
mels/022174.pt|so over the top jesus christ that's really really emotionally if that had been like a documentary i would have said powerful but to sell life insurance that's low man the
mels/005637.pt|he wasn't like that around the school stuff because he literally everything
mels/002810.pt|elon musk and it's sad because his friendship with google's ceo sergey brin for some reason
mels/030482.pt|there'll be a candle on the table
mels/027654.pt|it goes private and just starts bleeding
mels/014830.pt|so they lost all their employees their boss doubled down they spent a ton of man hours and money and time to create this entire network of
mels/024075.pt|i have through that it does look kind of sinister i got a video here of let's see more it looks less like less sinister
mels/017355.pt|what was interesting is so there was an interview with some amazon recruiters and executives about this massive hiring pace and
mels/021446.pt|the the odds are are not on your side there are a lot of forces including human nature against you making out with the
mels/012093.pt|it'd be like boo and i'd be like well let's hear
mels/000635.pt|we gotta make some money and so we all
mels/024139.pt|it's it's pretty big that the spending on twitch streamers has started or on streamers in general
mels/017317.pt|in world war two amazon is hiring people like they're
mels/002112.pt|i heard of that they try to i think i think they want god
mels/008214.pt|democratic party is going to lose very very very badly and mid terms and you know i i they do many many things that i disagree democratic party is going to lose very very very badly in midterms and
mels/021807.pt|him preach right at the top you were just witness
mels/026875.pt|you know they also taste great on salads
mels/002065.pt|there we go there we're talking
mels/014822.pt|the beginning so they launch it comes out into the world there's
mels/022458.pt|it was literally me trying to think of what is a gaming version of just do it i was just i'm so obsessed with how nike approaches marketing but i'm
mels/011057.pt|when i was growing up because i moved every two three years i never had like
mels/015218.pt|best positions going forward not because they
mels/031342.pt|and my dad is there and instead of yelling at me for a day he took the whole day and he took me to things to get my mind off of it he took me to the coca-cola headquarters museum
mels/026667.pt|one thing they majorly invested in and they convinced all these big sports owners to invest 60 million dollars to buy an
mels/005640.pt|we didn't talk too much that night but he was friendly and nice and cool and
mels/020808.pt|okay just read the words as written
mels/000437.pt|you're surrounded by friends you're having a good buzz the vibes are good
mels/020205.pt|little things hashtag the media jumped on the story case studies were written and lessons were learned about not giving the
mels/029761.pt|well yeah the big three it's been a whirlwind
mels/011569.pt|i want that watch when i grow up and then i did
mels/006190.pt|and then i'll take a picture with you
mels/032090.pt|all the rest of his allotted
mels/014409.pt|if you want to watch a twitch
mels/023970.pt|it's level so i'm gonna try and give you one layer deeper tuesday august
mels/014788.pt|like clean easy news app that kind of
mels/006927.pt|my first monthly shower do you only wear a hat when you haven't showered it's my biggest reason for wearing a hat is because usually i'll go to the gym around lunchtime and i'll get
mels/023523.pt|and that way you're getting margin
mels/018315.pt|acquisition company is what it means companies going public is a very long and arduous process let's
mels/025414.pt|this orc gets the drop on this gamer
mels/011706.pt|that's where it is and she's like no no no no no that's for staff and she thought she thought we were so stupid thankfully
mels/003449.pt|graphics cards basically a company called tsmc taiwan semiconductor makes a vast majority of the world's chips
mels/031393.pt|and listen listen i mean stanz did quit
mels/025565.pt|so and based on my experience with metroid i don't think we're
mels/008206.pt|is cringe they are doing many things that are anti the will of the majority of people that not much more i'm
mels/011768.pt|oh and there was one more
mels/026587.pt|if it's a drama filled situation call because when you dm someone's gonna leak it and it's gonna make you look foolish you can record a call okay that's different though because i don't think pokeman is
mels/021661.pt|you could win a million dollars
mels/007005.pt|if the shocked me he grabs my arm
mels/027482.pt|we possible opinion has already been taken but we're
mels/019943.pt|i mean nothing if the company didn't generate much return but even if you only count the
mels/027068.pt|when you do that you got
mels/023083.pt|is every single person in america spends about three grand a year eating out so in terms of amount of money at play here for marketers to capture it there's no comparison food is the dominant industry so you can see like every one of these chips solves the same consumer need you want
mels/001127.pt|they look at some memes and laugh
mels/022308.pt|you play mario kart you're gonna hate
mels/012225.pt|and so i go all in i look i look this
mels/031160.pt|and they were like oh man is he okay it's like bro you you're not okay
mels/015219.pt|because they've built out this global infrastructure they're fighting for
mels/016165.pt|but last is kind of cool it's almost like sigma you know
mels/002874.pt|leave the delaware supreme court at which point
mels/015499.pt|then they'll shoot up but right now they're valued exactly the same
mels/001456.pt|the only thing is i need you to scout's honor not to google
mels/027494.pt|into this subject because here's the deal
mels/025332.pt|my next fail speaking of squid game i
mels/018749.pt|at this let everyone know that you had the new file they didn't

mels/027082.pt|i i want to talk about sort of the the situation we find ourselves in in
mels/013384.pt|if the pillow and just sleep it's actually fire i know i feel bad
mels/012184.pt|one that shows the smuggler path is
mels/016534.pt|when every tournament in every game for years if you won every tournament in
mels/010992.pt|kind of like the eminem to your minions
mels/011998.pt|and a lot of the devil's

mels/031047.pt|in court dude witnesses turn up missing i
mels/007489.pt|at the original joe which is like a disgusting combination of weird
mels/028061.pt|electronics revolution the marketing was incredibly good
mels/007207.pt|i did not ghost him or pass on him no
mels/021791.pt|it's a little bit slower pace a little bit
mels/014631.pt|so if they can just find a way to help use that superpower towards live
mels/014892.pt|the competition and they're they're making
mels/007329.pt|was flicking people off was because some guy told me that
mels/031941.pt|we're talking about it and then when they find out what's going on
mels/011031.pt|yes i do sphinx king you specifically sphinx
mels/025922.pt|it's a pickup on reddit people were like hey what the what the hell's this they dropped
mels/002634.pt|two hundred and fifty dollars out of nowhere if this last one is heads
mels/000445.pt|and then we're very hungry we're extremely
mels/028037.pt|of news about all of the tactics that these big corporations are now using to fight back extra hard against the unions
mels/009508.pt|to sort of simplify my decisions oh no
mels/001425.pt|it's simple trivia question for the chance at some money hello hello hello
mels/014116.pt|for the next two three years of our lives just because we are so freaking lucky ninja was a hero if you were already a
mels/031132.pt|way harder just way harder and had better ideas and was not afraid to
mels/001553.pt|nearly instantly oh bonus question bonus question

mels/005826.pt|it didn't matter at all so anyway
mels/018392.pt|it's every industry they will tell you they can't afford to pay you more they almost always can they almost always can they just don't want to they want the
mels/010898.pt|there we go right here the minions rise of
mels/021149.pt|because you're afraid of raw human sexuality is that what it is will ferrell in his prime
mels/021096.pt|you can enjoy them all year long it's just

mels/001728.pt|the the tell them that he's lost everything and he's like he's like scared and he's like worried and so he bets all of his money on like a
mels/029862.pt|if he admits he would make you feel like you weren't human he
mels/001679.pt|the poor all right we're gonna watch it
mels/030939.pt|well that's kind of underground about it
mels/029643.pt|it'll be they're gonna play this little song

mels/031484.pt|trash you could grind i mean
mels/031939.pt|if people start to get mad like people sitting in the front like in in
mels/007863.pt|can you sell those giant foam fingers but
mels/020257.pt|if all those things and and if you try to go with
mels/000700.pt|one of my oldest friends i've actually known him even longer than stan's this
mels/012359.pt|whereas they play really loud like they
mels/001707.pt|as we descended upon the globe

mels/024878.pt|two bucks but if they gave him the trinket and said it's yours how much
mels/009708.pt|and the entirety of youtube's knowledge will be distilled into your brain it's like
mels/026971.pt|every criticism the one and only larry david really surprised people
mels/009102.pt|you know the more pixelated the
mels/028875.pt|and then all my friends there were like you should do

mels/017870.pt|if if there's someone who's still good
mels/012392.pt|so it's the final day and we've done
mels/020557.pt|so far is number one most
mels/021448.pt|you have to pull out first or you're left with nothing one more thing i have to say because people are
mels/015485.pt|i do that because the world is changing people want this stuff they're
mels/009914.pt|it's the wrong problem we need we need a
mels/002491.pt|and then people would pick sides and they'll be people are like i love
mels/003294.pt|whole family into a boring baseball game
mels/017320.pt|a draft during a war it's it's it's

mels/027351.pt|about what what things are are core and
mels/003292.pt|no i'm laughing but it's because it's because inflation has been rising bear with me
mels/019060.pt|you know about how i kind of
mels/019083.pt|why be comfortable with the uncanny valley is as you get closer to looking like a real human it gets more and more creepy so for example a pixar character is not creepy because you can tell it's
mels/030971.pt|actually this is this is the big news in america and we
mels/007244.pt|yeah i said don't worry about
mels/005788.pt|and i get roasted i get roasted for checking to see if my

mels/002376.pt|making large financial bets although i will tell you i
mels/027746.pt|and in fact today they announced that meta will
mels/008646.pt|and if they just openly gave it to him i think guaranteed he pays the billion for sure but i think more likely it's between
mels/026242.pt|it's been proven to almost double checkout
mels/011601.pt|he was amazing and better close all
mels/005010.pt|what of lawyers on his side
mels/022965.pt|it's actually just the fortnite company
mels/005070.pt|are there is no even shared system of uh
mels/020936.pt|the two years ago broke as a joke demands in a two million dollar
mels/018860.pt|one for the day probably netted five hundred G's for
mels/020594.pt|exclusive vip list here today at the marketing monday arena but i have seen so many celebrities right there the rock holy crap you can't see him because our
mels/017337.pt|they create jobs for and they can start to put pressure on local and state governments to get massive concessions on things like taxes and and uh factory building
mels/016652.pt|this has led to many opportunities if you're interested in battery technology battery maker
mels/005829.pt|i talked to e about it
mels/021746.pt|what the special but it actually was a boring repost so the
mels/026876.pt|yeah caesar we get it i love
mels/018791.pt|at us jump in to the first ad and then I
mels/007904.pt|let me just check one out so you just
mels/004175.pt|get a sense of the vibe figure it out
mels/030994.pt|it actually beat anybody up kind of way
mels/022681.pt|if millennials which at the time
mels/027389.pt|at the start cracking down on some things specifically with this big piece of news
mels/013224.pt|if the miffy thunder thank you
mels/031864.pt|the new players are going to valorent
mels/027927.pt|if you have to make layoffs it's tough today has been a brutal day at the office i made the painful decision to let go of
mels/017201.pt|my parents and i are boosting we all get it really bad yeah it's it's pretty variable i mean
mels/020663.pt|this award is for best esports marketing best esports partnership with a brand and to read this award we've got ourselves a special guest nathan one night stan stands general manager
mels/019536.pt|america now hear the full might of the canadian marketing military
mels/002305.pt|it's worth it i take 10 years off starting right
mels/021654.pt|in the universe this is crazy
mels/022433.pt|to you and these guys are cool and young and
mels/020540.pt|while multiplayer in some way it's the way to sustain but but because of the bugs because of the launch because of the
mels/026125.pt|and marketing starting with a major win for exactly five minutes to twitter shareholders because ceo of twitter jack dorsey finally stepped down to take a role as gandalf in lord of the
mels/019374.pt|with enron went from being like a pretty good
mels/023389.pt|it was a huge phenomenon and had massive prize pools that is the beginning
mels/002480.pt|that's me but with fortnite explain that how is that you but with fortnite do you buy a bunch of fortnights for
mels/030953.pt|that is not the word you
mels/018903.pt|with episodes that can be played on your phone now let me show you again you might have seen it in their ad but
mels/021214.pt|hundreds x times more than the average show disney if you'll notice has is actually pretty light on
mels/000596.pt|and i think okay that sucks because i'm
mels/023975.pt|during the peak of only fans hysteria
mels/010054.pt|well with the flag on the front
mels/003197.pt|he's on the straight and narrow there is no way that is a ponzi scheme so we're certain finally
mels/004764.pt|you know he he started talking
mels/017745.pt|it's for the car that add new random gimmicky things like you know holiday songs and etc etc this kind of
mels/011409.pt|and everyone was pissed myself included because you don't put mango at
mels/007407.pt|it was really fun although i will say look the
mels/024358.pt|with get his beer do you have to wait to get guinness beer do you have to wait to get
mels/032130.pt|rob went way harder than i thought
mels/008390.pt|i tweet once a month so you know it's
mels/019753.pt|most over hyped video games of all time
mels/024681.pt|in the way down it is not going to the moon and i would encourage you to not buy the dip but again every time i say that it goes up one dollar and someone goes you idiot if i had bought it at
mels/002067.pt|go all in on christianity yeah exactly
mels/011039.pt|well you guys don't know if it's good or bad
mels/031688.pt|that i could pretend to like when they asked me what anime
mels/028789.pt|could eternity and she goes no seriously what
mels/013114.pt|two days in a row of good sleep and working out i feel like i'm changing my life
mels/029931.pt|i remember i was talking to mango after
mels/026294.pt|we've built a brand as a company where you're you're more likely
mels/016810.pt|getting to level four which is still not
mels/020644.pt|you look and you know you feel like uncomfortable other people but you still want their friendship you know like sometimes you don't want
mels/012100.pt|my name was earl and he was darth
mels/031711.pt|you lovely lads and lasses in the chat he's got some pull these days so i get
mels/017079.pt|if the think that i do he would want us to almost
mels/029890.pt|if your twitter let me follow you we're just
mels/021583.pt|with gamestop right now okay they said okay let me borrow you they sold gamestop
mels/014886.pt|someone who's got their finger on the pulse of what gamers actually want and if you look
mels/025563.pt|with this union and increase their wages but humanity as a whole is my fail for this week because they found a way to put guns on robot dogs
mels/026758.pt|xbox game pass now they've been secretly working on it and it's been called project spartacus and i found out what it looked like by googling the word spartacus this is my best guess
mels/011828.pt|your phone i don't know and
mels/006097.pt|if you ever lose a game five set
mels/026331.pt|a verizon store costs less than half a million dollars to open but it shows right the difference between this and this it shows you can you can
mels/012922.pt|it's it was just tough like the overall follower
mels/010124.pt|does not look like he is taking it well
mels/008251.pt|one of the very first twitch employees
mels/016066.pt|and he saw potential in video
mels/005507.pt|i be worried of them saying something really bad or are we're not at this event it
mels/017884.pt|i think purchase and post purchase are the
mels/016808.pt|as north and south america combined and again that's a very small part of the global population which will be you know vast majority in
mels/019966.pt|isn't the buying pixar and at first he says no hell no of course not there's no way
mels/024733.pt|it's topic the psychological warfare of gotcha games and the tricks they used a parent you from your money and how they're being adopted as the it's the topic the psychological warfare of gotcha games and the tricks they use to
mels/030001.pt|you're getting you have like 98
mels/027361.pt|i think it would be difficult or challenging what makes a
mels/002951.pt|billion dollar budget uh massive directors
mels/003883.pt|i think people are like i think they're they're they're
mels/004747.pt|now at the time twitter stock let's say april
mels/026550.pt|and got a bunch of backlash for it and has
mels/013336.pt|that involved a lot of oreos
mels/000517.pt|like the the the bachelor party what
mels/022929.pt|none of them are heroes none of them like players it's a pretty
mels/026334.pt|i mean they're like temples they are temples to the brand they have people's attention and they have they have become a great way to get people to finally take the plunge and spend an expensive amount of money on a product it signifies
mels/001768.pt|that would have been much better as
mels/022606.pt|i think there's two ways you can go with this
mels/026743.pt|well not be enforcing any anti-trust
mels/029610.pt|or assertively rejecting cherished beliefs and institutions or established values and practices
mels/000104.pt|for helping support the content i've noticed and appreciate you for it
mels/026448.pt|if that cultural moment but i only have one i have one or two maybe i have maybe sheesh was a thing for
mels/014267.pt|ever seen in my entire life it it's just i i i i
mels/012588.pt|disney has passed netflix as the most subscribed streamer in three
mels/012933.pt|i didn't know how to explain that then i didn't i wasn't i didn't understand the business side of it enough i was
mels/032355.pt|the fairly difficult achievement but lying about
mels/016107.pt|that trend research is half the battle because you think my name is
mels/031780.pt|very first twitch atlas i pretty much decided i wasn't going to react to this again but the new one i looked at today is actually quite interesting and it shows how much
mels/023812.pt|setting up a goal that's just brilliant
mels/003029.pt|it was a shooting and the cops just literally
mels/000231.pt|if usually at craps if one person wins
mels/010763.pt|it's really want them to give answers no well
mels/000862.pt|five gifted i do appreciate zebby
mels/003286.pt|where to get into the bottom of it you know finally have real freedom freedom warriors out there trying to figure out what's the cause behind these crazy weather events we've been seeing and he's got a good correlation here i'm i'm somewhat you where to get into the bottom of it you know finally we have real freedom freedom warriors out there trying to figure out what's the cause behind these crazy weather events we've
mels/014379.pt|this is like the these three things i think are what keeps twitch in the lead
mels/029292.pt|i had gotten this possible internship at
mels/029146.pt|i could think about nothing else all day at school i got home i popped
mels/025821.pt|so the show was so good
mels/003768.pt|it could have real movement i think it's the beginning of all problems i think
mels/020019.pt|to look at um paypal was acquired by
mels/008141.pt|and that's probably illegal some sort of game off some sort of balloons off
mels/013140.pt|but they're bad at games they're trying really hard to crack games and it's so funny because riot has found it so much easier because they're already good at games they already have games and they could but they're bad at games so they're trying really hard to crack games and it's so funny because riot
mels/008404.pt|so it's you know it's it's just interesting and i i want to show you a couple
mels/024025.pt|i just the banks and make the banks okay with giving them the clearance to get the money they need okay they were trying to make it seem like there's going to be nothing over the line here just pure
mels/002312.pt|let's see what we got here on the stream
mels/027200.pt|we can also follow a lot of acclaimed investors and follow their moves you could follow for example kimball musk and sell tesla when he did and most importantly for me that makes it stand out from its competition here is that
mels/031462.pt|it's point by the way i was toasty the the sun and the alcohol
mels/024790.pt|is they highly incentivize social proof
mels/031890.pt|it's a little bit like i liked her
mels/013481.pt|girlfriend is crying me an empath i'm sensing that you want me to go play playstation for
mels/003304.pt|seemed to indicate that we were headed for multiple quarters of negative economic growth falling gdp which by the
mels/026753.pt|at the monopoly directly it would reduce two players to one that being said there are a lot of companies that are still on the table so i put together this how does sony bounce back well let me tell you when industries enter periods of
mels/027069.pt|the more clever than this and this wasn't i
mels/022015.pt|was immediately after posting it the second
mels/000886.pt|we'll figure out where we meet we'll
mels/029702.pt|one more and he sits up for one second
mels/032155.pt|if you guys don't play crafts i'd like to give
mels/031874.pt|these three things you could just see it had a massive impact and then if you talk about these it's like
mels/002924.pt|and i watched it and i had my phone and
mels/032135.pt|worried when i show up they say
mels/003861.pt|he doesn't he looks old he looks old and
mels/013807.pt|now i think i'm gonna watch i'm gonna watch
mels/002799.pt|why is the mic so broke i don't know man
mels/011547.pt|as your representation for the world and that has never had a good take not one and i've been on the internet a long time i haven't seen one sesame street is just one piece for kids
mels/019570.pt|do with what they want to deal with it what they want to do is they want to
mels/007252.pt|help i'm happy to help but i'm not trying to
mels/007576.pt|this mammoth plate of food features three eggs a half pound of meat and then more than enough spinach uh you have to play jump king
mels/007770.pt|then i wouldn't feel so embarrassed about it but i think i'll just put my pants on don't have to ask me twice
mels/004099.pt|exhausted heading into monday but i recovered i'm totally back
mels/032370.pt|it over and over and over and over and over
mels/022912.pt|how they love the idea of
mels/017435.pt|is that are cool are long gone
mels/018949.pt|when times are tough in a business
mels/022791.pt|you know damn we made a mistake
mels/016410.pt|i go deeply into it but it's called the
mels/010048.pt|to the task you don't even wear a mask so
mels/024764.pt|okay adding up to billions so now let me get into some of the
mels/014348.pt|of gamers at a certain subset of hyper online people and it's it's big but
mels/010540.pt|we'll figure it out we'll figure it out
mels/030978.pt|to my closet so i could burn my nike joggers if you
mels/019319.pt|and we said we are going to win this thing we started a company called
mels/023470.pt|fat chunk of cash on every car sold and that's
mels/017700.pt|use the genius bar which is millions million
mels/032015.pt|and then you could just see
mels/007020.pt|it's max w designs on twitter
mels/028912.pt|at that point when i get back down i believe is when the night starts to take a turn for the less fun that's when i start to realize i'm
mels/026564.pt|game for the love of it then i'm really
mels/014313.pt|would almost never be worth it for someone like ludwig to go to youtube let's say either side didn't pay and it was just like let's go to the platform that's better he might be like okay youtube's got some
mels/029657.pt|if the was game plan he's like okay okay so yeah
mels/029305.pt|i the having a meeting with a bunch of people from riot
mels/009449.pt|if they all flew out to the
mels/019166.pt|so this is a better ad but
mels/025743.pt|the marketing message and be interesting it's
mels/029198.pt|please is the dude who made it rich now
mels/024225.pt|arrow potential some ads were shot for 20
mels/013030.pt|did he get scammed oh yeah yeah sort of we landed on that it was
mels/015656.pt|help with some predictions of where i think we're going based on these analysis okay
mels/031109.pt|it's one of those things where luck meets opportunity right like if
mels/019407.pt|things we would have done different create a cheap brand in each market get
mels/016252.pt|that of his contract lmao and
mels/009269.pt|going to win the vote mr peace or ninja get
mels/021111.pt|im starburst pardon me what kind of
mels/015543.pt|and it just hasn't been a good driver so so far nobody's really like decided
mels/013931.pt|solution and theoretically if you pay
mels/031034.pt|out of that place they all cleared up it was
mels/023737.pt|there's some competitors you can probably think of that have pretty big markups raycon does
mels/002803.pt|welcome to marketing monday on monday
mels/026787.pt|if sort of come to dominate our entire economy apple amazon facebook and google facebook now meta those companies and you could say microsoft as well actually between those five companies they basically have no industry
mels/016000.pt|that's when prices go way up
mels/023960.pt|we'll see all right so that's those
mels/029444.pt|out of the room so i can just talk to this guy
mels/020207.pt|it's to advertise on facebook it's safer
mels/028913.pt|very ill the alcohol is way way too much
mels/013640.pt|membership feels like too much of a commitment
mels/010765.pt|individual chatters are not stupid as individuals if i ever like single someone out there
mels/016369.pt|unfortunately not really michael horowitz is the top cop overseeing the effort to make sure the 5 trillion in
mels/026192.pt|i am giving a failed arcane because i'm going to have to explain to an angry audience in a few years why i don't understand or like
mels/010841.pt|i am going to jungle turns out in smite there is no equivalent to
mels/015686.pt|need the combined half of each other's uh
mels/004624.pt|the a rich superstar like you yeah it's basically all
mels/023461.pt|or market share they want a lot of people using it either way
mels/018747.pt|spending less money on the phone and from the back no one could tell it was the new one you couldn't flex okay and so apple solved this problem with this
mels/023677.pt|which is which is just weird i hate brand personas i don't want to hear how and i
mels/027384.pt|now getting an official sonic the hedgehog game backed by sega called sonic speed simulator roblox gets a cut of this
mels/029942.pt|i remember very distinctly i couldn't go to that event i was sitting in my my then girlfriend's apartment watching royal flush and when
mels/023918.pt|i understood what it was like to be a sports fan and it made me go like actual sports
mels/032144.pt|sign because i haven't even been enticed by anything yet i
mels/015050.pt|let's pivot to streaming so they started a dual service where they kept the dvd rental service but they also added free streaming it was called watch now you could open up your your
mels/014367.pt|is so incentivizing for big developers to focus only on twitch drops
mels/004265.pt|i i'm just saying i could have world economy saved
mels/028963.pt|well i have no dollars no wand no debit card
mels/028737.pt|so and it was like respond within

mels/030006.pt|at the day and they all come to peep off
mels/002299.pt|i like twitch is not 10 years old dude
mels/024812.pt|and the fact is if i wanted that skin and couldn't buy it directly but had to buy 60 packs or
mels/018273.pt|in coffee what are you just
mels/013255.pt|as it get like push even mango even as it good i like push
mels/020340.pt|he knew every model every color
mels/006959.pt|for who jeff bezos maybe one pog for me
mels/022779.pt|this housing bubble's kind of bursting
mels/017433.pt|i have really shiny hair and shiny hair looks great on instagram that's a that's a response okay and then
mels/023693.pt|oh no why would you make it a poll why would you make it a poll bro
mels/002244.pt|why doesn't tesla advertise tesla advertises just like anyone else
mels/027481.pt|it's good and bad already everything i'm
mels/012153.pt|i didn't get the full video it was crazy because right after she said that
mels/019017.pt|and they don't want to think of a clever tweet for your brand
mels/020592.pt|awards in the history of mankind the monday awards officially called the
mels/010593.pt|it's differences and we could have our one voice unite
mels/000321.pt|well the warehouse with like uh fake walls and
mels/001930.pt|i want more free time i want like time with
mels/013514.pt|it's actually named after tits so it's more like
mels/017382.pt|we can hopefully have a future where every single movie we watch all year is a marvel movie the dream with your health we can make it happen i want to see a spiderman movie in we can hopefully have a future where every single movie we watch all year is a marvel movie the dream with your help we can make it happen i want to see a spider-man movie in
mels/011674.pt|here's the thing though before i before i go into it i want you guys
mels/030030.pt|while doing an impersonation i can do the same thing with you
mels/022915.pt|this is from sony the guy from sony says sorry
mels/019204.pt|i handle and it was purple like the Barney
mels/024593.pt|well of appearing in court without wearing a tuxedo as he originally was required to do in the opening days of the trial thank god for the justice system thank god so you know what maybe fortnite
mels/006246.pt|what's good what's good how's everybody doing do you guys have work or school tomorrow like thursday and friday is it an nvidia only holiday
mels/030758.pt|this let me show you right here no text no text at all i went to
mels/027835.pt|what used to be the main metric for businesses until this whole bubble and uh these guys are burning
mels/007310.pt|and i felt no no no one of them was
mels/025986.pt|was hilarious it's about and eating it
mels/008991.pt|when you can get twitter for free in the app store you are the first person to make that joke it definitely has not been it definitely has not been over a month since that joke was first made and it's been repeated hundreds of thousands of times pretty much every done this story brings up sense you are the first then i really appreciate that and it's an honor to have the cutting edge canadians when you can get twitter for free in the app store you are the first person to make that joke it definitely has not been it definitely has not been over a month since that joke was first made and it's been repeated hundreds of thousands of times pretty much every time this story brings up sense you are the first and i really
mels/015307.pt|if he lives there i'm pretty sure he
mels/023724.pt|but outside of that hilarious commercial speaking of marketing let me interrupt your regularly scheduled
mels/031401.pt|it's to really stretched that 3k
mels/019780.pt|they cranked up the graphics they ran it on
mels/019573.pt|and they can say i like that one i
mels/007661.pt|project just hang out with the arkham frogs you know the arkham frogs
mels/028837.pt|free day i slept at the office i bought a cheap
mels/029496.pt|just like the end of the dog is gonna
mels/016576.pt|industry that's rapidly growing every year
mels/008495.pt|actually i legitimately read the entire
mels/015787.pt|and those are just basically niche services
mels/012534.pt|it was expensive and i still
mels/003527.pt|are no but i i would say that loans in general
mels/015954.pt|they should generate custom thumbnails and
mels/031865.pt|and that's a bad look especially now that n a
mels/024022.pt|been able to find out they weren't even really trying to ban
mels/027343.pt|who wasn't talking to them who said that boss was hard i beat
mels/014686.pt|i think at all what did it say
mels/028562.pt|ninja all right you're the one
mels/020943.pt|if the poor odds of success far too long i like this idea it can be taken the wrong way like if you have a new year's resolution to go to the gym more giving up
mels/011822.pt|like the six or seven maybe eight eight or yeah probably about eight eight
mels/032047.pt|it's that's too far bro your set was school
mels/009384.pt|what have you try to triple ban out double lift
mels/023859.pt|well coke and everyone thought they won and so sales of the original coke spiked so rather than hurting coke it was one
mels/012739.pt|put the time in and you always get more
mels/021207.pt|well netflix that was wrong netflix is not going
mels/030908.pt|giving you a wedding cake and i'm helping
mels/009299.pt|i think a way to be able
mels/007959.pt|topic ready for tomorrow but i'm not doing it today ready for this little
mels/019895.pt|who all played this collectively on your mom's ipad okay any game you play while
mels/023197.pt|that means essentially almost nothing is
mels/018311.pt|pretty cool thanks man i'm not sure you get marketing monday just yet
mels/016874.pt|this is uh media use and it turns out that the
mels/002199.pt|i i find so few free journalist sources
mels/023355.pt|show that they really do not like cross-play at all they openly fight it they hate it they don't want it to happen and now they are finally insisting no we
mels/019255.pt|they usually make bad decisions and when they are struggling for market share and trying to to win a competition they make good decisions if you I mean you guys
mels/027179.pt|march 7th let's talk about our topic so
mels/020616.pt|i thought there was a one in a trillion chance a one in seven
mels/019973.pt|is this is a conservative estimate because really without it disney
mels/017792.pt|i don't have too many of them mango has a
mels/028575.pt|you just made me money and i'm not freaking out from the
mels/009425.pt|is not that much because he has so much compounded experience over the entire game but if you have somebody who's played only a little bit they have probably one or two champions of experience and it falls off hard so them getting banned out is way worse
mels/024088.pt|was actually the goat of pioneering
mels/016034.pt|the monday and i think they are oh
mels/019902.pt|was so disappointed with this game
mels/002071.pt|i'm thinking though for the wedding maybe i'll get like
mels/030980.pt|in this person that makes dream look like a
mels/008628.pt|if they don't they're not getting their packages and
mels/013523.pt|read below that is boring this is amazing
mels/020375.pt|i don't like him i don't trust him i don't want what he's buying i don't
mels/012673.pt|i wonder if i should play it i think the problem is i have to play
mels/031398.pt|that this was not like a big this was not like a break to bank
mels/001798.pt|i really respect he's a long time journalist in
mels/004340.pt|will be able to stop laughing the
mels/025382.pt|it is genius it is of course the new esports line of clothing at walmart
mels/032365.pt|it at least one of the runs every
mels/005875.pt|not be able to cosplay but you should come with me
mels/004080.pt|okay you can put a spin on it you don't have
mels/004856.pt|me listen who hasn't been a billionaire stealing other people's content and then getting into petty twitter
mels/016199.pt|at least half the money goes to jeff and that's sweet you know it feels like it's a win-win it's like you can support a
mels/021434.pt|well as their boss and so they shut down trading which is i mean that's blatant market manipulation they stopped you from being able to buy they only allowed you to sell
mels/010461.pt|well there's no shot that was a month ah in total all monkey ball ever is
mels/007736.pt|so i'll be posting his address here very
mels/028385.pt|back and forth until both of them die i'm pretty sure there's just five
mels/029366.pt|no problem then the middle of the
mels/023731.pt|and most importantly to me i use it at night when i'm listening to podcasts before i go to bed in bed it's a game changer okay that combined with reason number two the long battery life
mels/008844.pt|in the court case it's it's it's very unprecedented i think i think him walking away without paying twitter any money is extremely low unless he's
mels/018061.pt|god gamer god gamers are built different
mels/000624.pt|when i was in bed i think
mels/010564.pt|if anything i'm a good friend because i'm
mels/018873.pt|the dog commercials get ready to write this
mels/025310.pt|the fail goes to blizzard that's not
mels/002124.pt|what of people saying copium no shot no way
mels/021972.pt|this is a real story that he remembers
mels/026595.pt|in a generation a marketer comes along that changes everything and no it's not
mels/022807.pt|the online at its peak one most importantly they charged you by the hour and it was slow it was
mels/018462.pt|will never leave oh my god
mels/018352.pt|do not ask for things in a job negotiation
mels/000509.pt|at church and pray yeah yeah so on
mels/013923.pt|and i would like to talk really
mels/013331.pt|isn't that sad don't you want to be trustworthy
mels/015750.pt|had good months here and there and are using these as trend lines for a future that doesn't exist because people had good months here and there and they're using these as trend lines for a future
mels/009970.pt|and he can sing he does have moxie uh play it
mels/004146.pt|believe me i told him i told
mels/024396.pt|what a million dollars on your ad you could
mels/002370.pt|i'm sure you will have extra
mels/023533.pt|and the margin of ferrari they make as much money per phone as like a ferrari
mels/030315.pt|i had to tell heath ledger's joker and right i mean literally
mels/029453.pt|he brings out a laptop with cube world and he's like this game's
mels/029961.pt|what do you mean you weren't
mels/026843.pt|i was pretty solid mediocre this is almost every
mels/020485.pt|within their claim to fame but they've made a lot more than that okay they also made the
mels/023452.pt|and this is a dollar okay so i'm making 50 cents right here
mels/000309.pt|it on and i tell everybody this like on friday i tell everybody i say hey this
mels/016768.pt|people are dying almost as fast as
mels/003808.pt|one person to go to jail that goes to beat him up
mels/009405.pt|scales really well into the late game
mels/027999.pt|and a surprising first of the
mels/004461.pt|in the world created by george
mels/031822.pt|which is the goal i've been trying to get into so the
mels/013511.pt|imagine a human city called manchester
mels/031424.pt|if the it as an airbnb
mels/020191.pt|is pushing something rather take that brand hey fellow gen
mels/025134.pt|most people they see that they go oh that's so sad and then they they change the channel okay so not very effective and i feel
mels/025995.pt|they thought the best way to deliver that campaign on social was to tweet try
mels/029526.pt|and did it at least that would have helped make
mels/006267.pt|what happened with netflix and their gigantic
mels/027165.pt|we afford all of the debts that it owes not just on the national debt but on social security etc is to make the amount they owe worth less so there's it's kind of a
mels/010715.pt|you're not you're not going to go down in money
mels/000683.pt|i just got cherry blossoms in there it's really
mels/015779.pt|nobody could outbid cable companies on sports but finally like amazon and big tech companies are starting to like youtube and amazon are
mels/019053.pt|if the you guys but sometimes i get a little nervous in front of crowds you know
mels/012188.pt|we're open seat but you need an opponent
mels/008307.pt|and then we're gonna go about 90 maybe
mels/004702.pt|i don't know if that's sure enough but i
mels/024293.pt|i did a good job i listen i'm not really in the market for a jag but if you're the type of person who might have that income and might be attracted that
mels/027939.pt|and it's all included in the app
mels/021120.pt|well we could bridge the age gap
mels/023213.pt|if you haven't seen it is absolutely fire free range doesn't mean anything
mels/007529.pt|for the for the for the possible sponsorship because he knows
mels/020659.pt|i am just floored and i'm just i'm just stunned the way he says take it to the house kid while riding a tractor for no reason as a professional gamer that they somehow got an nfl
mels/006503.pt|if the the of those companies
mels/017256.pt|we making or inventing anything then sexism is
mels/004400.pt|kind of weird that there's no like atrial branding on it though you know since we're basically co-sponsors of
mels/027941.pt|what they post you can follow me on there you can follow cody co or scott galloway or
mels/003432.pt|gets re-elected to a third term i
mels/024005.pt|and they're not that smart to be nine head planning this okay the truth
mels/017876.pt|i mean that's it they they're

mels/000206.pt|i haven't seen him a little
mels/008763.pt|i don't want to buy this company do you know
mels/004734.pt|we're experienced and as of today it has been confirmed that he is doing everything he can legally do to get out of buying twitter he is tossing in the towel
mels/008652.pt|doing like his bot argument doesn't have legal
mels/005954.pt|i mean it's like people are talking about

mels/006739.pt|big block letters dude it was like
mels/012852.pt|we on something like that um
mels/006408.pt|software program with a hundred thousand
mels/015707.pt|i'm going to give them a try because
mels/032106.pt|anyway scar i'm really happy to be
mels/026227.pt|because they use a lot of variety names because they don't want to say interest they never want to say interest and they
mels/024636.pt|if the fingers in the pulse in a more somber
mels/013074.pt|he told you this the teacher was just talking about that
mels/019923.pt|the forefront of pioneering new game stuff because of the biggest selling so by the time what
mels/024564.pt|you for a cut the thing is that's
mels/011142.pt|never make fun of your board look
mels/014065.pt|ludwig's motivation and leadership and connection with auto
mels/013632.pt|actual streaming wars twitch v youtube
mels/024542.pt|want to subscribe to me on ios if you do it through the twitch app on ios apple gets a cut but if you just go to the web
mels/023504.pt|he spends nothing now this is on
mels/001485.pt|so i should never say the
mels/001306.pt|is that once something becomes popular not only does
mels/012413.pt|is everybody and it's like yeah yeah now
mels/018757.pt|and they can just upgrade the front and the

mels/012861.pt|i have a junior and senior and
mels/029976.pt|i did i did i was number one on twitch first time ever i believe
mels/006522.pt|i only did this and apple was doing it as one
mels/009564.pt|actually makes money actually for emirates doing great
mels/025714.pt|i think any marketing where it's like giving
mels/027249.pt|is there's a lot of ubisoft related memes because they have the
mels/004246.pt|crypto solves this crypto solves this dude
mels/020342.pt|at management was thrilled happy holidays from
mels/015337.pt|yeah that's the one thing they've been um

mels/009999.pt|what was the link banger novak related tweet
mels/011633.pt|or cruiser if you guys don't know about it disney
mels/019918.pt|suck it down and let me tell you something doing this now would get headlines but doing this back in
mels/017934.pt|the owners that are completely just leeching off the leagues you know
mels/008225.pt|so you know the best thing that could happen in my mind is that joe biden
mels/014385.pt|is no other reason so these
mels/022186.pt|this is ahri's submission for sad ads so
mels/000650.pt|it was the second we got them uh so
mels/023783.pt|mercedes shooting people and get filmed that's one of the
mels/004318.pt|did i imply in any way that steve carell
mels/001947.pt|we're very long but the only thing i do think about not not
mels/008139.pt|i wish i could i wish i could have
mels/030192.pt|well the other one would grab the person's leg and drag them down
mels/026808.pt|zuckerberg in the nuts i mean it's a massive
mels/000690.pt|john drinking come to the real restaurant and so after we finish the drink they
mels/028381.pt|bandwidth right now maybe if we could reallocate
mels/021712.pt|one remembers as a toyota ad
mels/004168.pt|was two years almost but not quite okay
mels/009767.pt|doesn't do it at all anyway today we're gonna be watching
mels/014081.pt|it's amazon's very focused on not talking not
mels/011807.pt|and they're every single window is a
mels/021891.pt|alex piece of advice is probably the most important thing not a joke in this whole presentation
mels/029755.pt|trust you you better have a total monopoly on
mels/021915.pt|i invited my family on to
mels/007963.pt|i'm giving him a percentage cut of the revenue of every marketing monday video
mels/030377.pt|so i like make sure awkwardly and thank she said
mels/007509.pt|it starts to dig in dude
mels/014601.pt|bad idea it would be too late
mels/025626.pt|pc gamers if you are a pc gamer you are having a good week because of the announcement of the brand new playstation pc brand an official brand
mels/015595.pt|tough sell it cheaply and make
mels/017953.pt|is great but to make a seamless delivery and online service order they were way way better
mels/021573.pt|the the person i don't it's illegal the naked short
mels/014316.pt|better tech and specifically the ability to rewind live broadcasts the ability to actually smoothly scrub through a live broadcast is a nuclear bomb of youtube side it loads better it loads smoother globally it has a seamless live experience if you
mels/018275.pt|at first yes but i don't work here yet then why do you keep coming back when i was in the service my dad he sent me this book and it was written by the guy who started this company and every word in the book i mean i wanted to be that guy and when i got back i thought the best way to learn would be to work here you know i wrote that book yes i know that your
mels/010525.pt|well it's not we don't wanna i
mels/021339.pt|one predictions also i predict that i will get
mels/019324.pt|well class there was compute you some douchebags there was pear tech
mels/006153.pt|and then like you can even see
mels/008407.pt|i wouldn't don't let her boss you around
mels/010570.pt|my stream to stop this cat from getting out there other people
mels/022128.pt|is pretty dystopian but that guy's a little more
mels/011269.pt|maybe you should turn that down nah nope
mels/008283.pt|this is again a hello fresh by the way
mels/010712.pt|acs bracket there is no world where you go down in total earnings
mels/024579.pt|or that much but apple is fully within their right to ban you from the app store for life which they're doing so apple in response
mels/000643.pt|they learned they studied my tactics dude it was a real train wreck situation
mels/028601.pt|and i got invited to a tournament called
mels/029975.pt|oh okay what's the marketing thing this week well i don't want to spoil it
mels/031521.pt|and they sent out the two best players in the world
mels/030191.pt|grabbing each other's shirt like if
mels/018806.pt|the the five unfortunately boys and
mels/017843.pt|what much easier than its competitors at the
mels/005708.pt|it prop guns that they had
mels/005067.pt|then right sexual misconduct left and right and receiving no consequences at all i don't
mels/016089.pt|what are you talking about has a timer that counts down
mels/020129.pt|we started posting memes wendy's dropped a mixtape
mels/020756.pt|suing facebook for being a illegal monopoly and i read the lawsuit took months to prepare
mels/003638.pt|we are over the next few years about
mels/017998.pt|and they have a conservative majority
mels/001163.pt|microwavable meal and i've had a bunch because i'm lazy i just
mels/000928.pt|in one thousand dollars okay i like your moxie aim reasonable twenty thousand dollars
mels/031798.pt|of entirely new audience to twitch
mels/002030.pt|like it feels like we should get
mels/011912.pt|it's the third and final is probably the final major plus
mels/014581.pt|with the streaming war is it better for google to back out to avoid losing face if they lose to twitch
mels/003619.pt|sorry that you have to live with him
mels/010686.pt|my streamer asked how i'm doing
mels/030655.pt|i clutch a couple more all
mels/018598.pt|i decided they're thinking about it i'm certain i'm sure
mels/025767.pt|riot games and blizzard entertainment a
mels/011119.pt|and then when i asked you what i said you said i was dozing yeah
mels/021805.pt|it belongs in only a single category that was created for this actually was
mels/025912.pt|denied him his prize money denied him
mels/000128.pt|not there was that much wheat but there
mels/020428.pt|and then you've got cardi b's twerk shop
mels/016752.pt|massive demographic crisis usually to be a healthy
mels/001825.pt|but he did order the murder of jamal khashoggi
mels/002622.pt|i really i thought i thought the content
mels/012287.pt|he's like the smuggler guy and he's like super into it he's like talking to us
mels/016807.pt|the vast majority of people will be in asia if you guys notice here the red is asia
mels/026786.pt|it's about meta facebook's in some real
mels/026826.pt|and everyone's got an opinion and i want to hear
mels/023480.pt|an advertising that's way more than
mels/016558.pt|the world to determine how these things play out the technology doesn't really decide whether it ends up good or bad it's going to happen
mels/030112.pt|hold it to my lips hey pikachu
mels/025154.pt|his popularity was like peaked in 2002
mels/010977.pt|this is a film this is art
mels/027000.pt|i coordinate well with their tech team because having the website go down defeats a lot of the purpose but people
mels/021540.pt|as invested in a lot of different things let's say you have a million shares of amazon a million shares of apple
mels/003714.pt|it's basically use them as r
mels/000358.pt|so we keep throwing down money matches 5v5
mels/026716.pt|is a good time to buy in number two they want
mels/015584.pt|absolutely cheap stuff and that brings us back to our favorite company
mels/024695.pt|i have a feeling that the dip that we are
mels/002855.pt|if the for businesses so businesses actually get
mels/017944.pt|screens is a big part of food brand value in general you know
mels/009059.pt|oh wait a minute hold up wait a minute
mels/022485.pt|while they don't get me you don't you feel like you're you're understood for a
mels/007600.pt|thank you for the birthday prime i appreciate that
mels/004090.pt|no i'm not going to take my lunch break
mels/029284.pt|sad to see a truck forgot the game which
mels/020775.pt|great ads to choose from we've reviewed
mels/024690.pt|it is not financial advice do whatever you
mels/016169.pt|feet through the floor and run the car flintstone style
mels/006406.pt|pretty much the whole thing seems fraudulent hopefully they get in some kind of trouble for this but
mels/026904.pt|well it's usually has a pretty good idea of what
mels/029470.pt|and then i was so close on that
mels/010250.pt|every leech that is downstream from the
mels/028134.pt|nobody wants to do it again so instead of being public right now
mels/006432.pt|we use the guild treasury and buy everyone a
mels/002740.pt|what a deal there is no way that
mels/021714.pt|want to buy a car i think no more or less of toyota after watching this
mels/019730.pt|i get behind the need of a degree and then making that degree cost more and more every year is is a monopoly it's a monopoly on a piece of paper that you need to access and they can keep charging more and more for it so this is the fail
mels/028618.pt|our head of korea and he was a very good
mels/013788.pt|and yes there is okay this is a big win for science okay i think gamers in chat can relate have
mels/013802.pt|you guys are literally on a worse
mels/026717.pt|what access to the great ip okay there's there's starcraft
mels/012711.pt|are a normals league player you could probably
mels/001449.pt|get smarter again the game you guys couldn't answer
mels/019346.pt|i know that i invented the
mels/009921.pt|instead that you hated unions have you ever
mels/032107.pt|in the past 15 seconds he just threw it
mels/024288.pt|in that it's very obvious and the
mels/006631.pt|i think luca had more points than all of the
mels/030012.pt|i didn't but i won't i'm not going to
mels/016711.pt|wasn't even going far enough i mean we you know in america we need public rail we need a lot of things but we have no ability to invest in it
mels/017664.pt|you spend that extra amount of money on apple products and you notice the the diff difference in craftsmanship and and
mels/011892.pt|like they were more into it than i was
mels/031918.pt|most people were sitting in these seats
mels/016798.pt|well the top but we are eliminating the most extremes of poverty and that that is truth and
mels/012261.pt|the game but he asked me to take over from the
mels/015114.pt|from us and what he was saying was at the time was that
mels/003752.pt|why people but after citizens united they can just
mels/013971.pt|no such thing so you're you're not really getting anything they're literally have no
mels/012821.pt|it's just all my friends and family i was
mels/028962.pt|my debit card and i have no money and i can't take out
mels/025699.pt|world would be fantastic no comment ps3 it only does everything now
mels/026311.pt|with the time and that has allowed them i
mels/002819.pt|we know about and he's not even getting laid
mels/029622.pt|oh for the next episode i was just curious yeah
mels/000122.pt|did you end up losing your voice a bit we say
mels/023591.pt|and laugh bp tweeted the first step the first step to reducing your emissions is the know where you stand find out your hashtag carbon footprint with our new calculator and show your pledge the day and then andrew here said and laugh bp tweeted the first step the first step to reducing your emissions is to know where you stand find out your hashtag carpet footprint
mels/011190.pt|but i know you're not cause you keep telling me that you're
mels/000399.pt|everyone's winning i think i'm winning
mels/021199.pt|okay i am predicting i'm manifesting
mels/001251.pt|yeah but she has to do everything herself and it
mels/031167.pt|you know someone more greedy could
mels/001319.pt|i didn't understand that primitive technology is a real
mels/024252.pt|for the price tag of 5 million plus
mels/031786.pt|want the of twitch it has literally been amaranth with 90 percent
mels/028668.pt|when i go back and do my work dude
mels/028995.pt|i'm doing a cheerless right now streamers i can beat and hand-to-hand combat stupid idea there are not to put me bitch you are on i'm doing a tearless right now streamers i can beat in hand to hand combat
mels/013393.pt|when this happens it feels like you get a great sleep on a flight it's awesome i'm not broke don't call me broke
mels/005183.pt|i'm not sure where that fits like
mels/008594.pt|in the back out later the contract you know specifies that he's waving his right to discovery
mels/019955.pt|they sucked they did not do well now disney animation in the 90s was on a
mels/028277.pt|been like i think this guy's kind of odd and he gave
mels/008460.pt|is the most boring job in the world
mels/017890.pt|in a better brand experience at your touch
mels/008636.pt|they have a lot of employees leaving
mels/000708.pt|like he he he convinced me
mels/014770.pt|the marketing monday proper with the wins and fails and before i do
mels/015214.pt|bro i support more than two languages yeah
mels/015158.pt|at to deliver squid getting people
mels/026248.pt|of three trillion dollars the highest valuation for a company in human history there are a few possible edge cases the dutch east india company was worth maybe 7 trillion at the height of
mels/015507.pt|at number one baby that's apple also
mels/004399.pt|i will rep that jersey for sure
mels/013533.pt|but he wasn't half bad he
mels/025221.pt|announced because we need it out fast
mels/031753.pt|where you've told me there's a class
mels/003213.pt|the original something they would basically hire
mels/023124.pt|so you don't know what the that is
mels/025484.pt|so the fail is this guy
mels/006263.pt|wow i got dinner okay wait give me a second i'm not
mels/003073.pt|the have reflected you know we talk about marketing and business and in all of
mels/000237.pt|whether it's the entire casino friends and strangers against my brother
mels/010704.pt|why this whole store if you can balance it on a balance beam
mels/024969.pt|worldwide is sony and so i looked into it and it's most people
mels/008653.pt|it as an argument and it doesn't have
mels/004564.pt|yo yo kind of pretty cool
mels/029802.pt|when i started working at twitch we started
mels/028080.pt|we have to get ahead of that and so
mels/017224.pt|i think someone said something about
mels/017351.pt|oh yeah yeah that's a good one
mels/026418.pt|effective so and and you can apply
mels/005496.pt|one else is gone dude everyone else
mels/016781.pt|this is a real problem millennial the
mels/024100.pt|the fail let me give a fail to every other
mels/007588.pt|now but i'm also down to do the reddit
mels/015122.pt|and they knew this in a way
mels/024818.pt|the best way to make sure of both your retention and your monetization is to make sure you have enough of an in-game economy in
mels/025808.pt|generally most people would agree riot games was why even have the
mels/008357.pt|and wages are in trouble and
mels/021984.pt|manager for like six months and he is more tired than i've ever seen in my entire life and
mels/005675.pt|this world everyone there is extremely talented and good
mels/018299.pt|in the book you're just standing around
mels/013522.pt|i am so sick of like how i grew my
mels/016565.pt|these lines are public and private universities massively increased while wages have stayed basically flat which means every single year universities get more and more expensive now this is obviously a negative thing by any metric but it also represents opportunity there has never been a better time for a disruption to education people are finding new ways to learn i mean
mels/031656.pt|and i've got my hand on it and we're
mels/015506.pt|at the top of the list let's go to the very top and look at apple okay because while these guys are down here at
mels/020082.pt|for a six figure salary yes it is
mels/023822.pt|and that ad will be stop drinking tie
mels/024102.pt|i might be on manhunts next who knows okay he both watched and commented he is a fan okay he loves the content i am now turning my entire channel into
mels/019387.pt|as they they came in and had one quarter of success in traveler the very next
mels/005413.pt|quack you are not literally you think the net what do you think the net is on money
mels/014502.pt|can going anywhere with twitch so he was getting
mels/003561.pt|other than me so a lot of them
mels/017070.pt|at died yeah i know sad
mels/022550.pt|is an ad pokemon go when it came out
mels/029740.pt|and he was just yelling seventh place seventh place really loudly in my ear
mels/029404.pt|i will i will let you know later it has to be immediate
mels/001731.pt|the crew members having a bed it's like how fast
mels/012526.pt|fucking to inexpensive and so if if uh it
mels/008826.pt|eight months to a year i feel like if you go back
mels/009632.pt|he tries to save the turret it's not it's not i mean listen i i respect the
mels/011038.pt|what what are we talking about here
mels/002053.pt|you can't hear it oops sucks for you
mels/006093.pt|what did you think i was talking about like you thought armchair psychologists were
mels/007159.pt|bigger problems that is how i that's my general opinion so if you
mels/018706.pt|exxon mobil that's right they could also
mels/015831.pt|that that is the that is the change of
mels/012181.pt|everyone's like wait where's he going
mels/005662.pt|be more degenerate maybe she's uh i guess
mels/026470.pt|the is a great example i don't want
mels/012073.pt|did it in character he did
mels/021774.pt|with their relationship that she has to lie about eating cheetos and then how stupid is ashton or how stupid does mila think she
mels/021279.pt|twitch prime is just amazon throwing

mels/025263.pt|and then he became a mega star out of
mels/026621.pt|and i was exaggerating this is not the case this is not an exaggeration the reason i didn't think this was possible i
mels/027582.pt|the million dollars last year it didn't make any profit at all

mels/014423.pt|for to these companies amazon and
mels/015739.pt|they'll release a new show that
mels/011515.pt|is kind of a researched and bold stance that if you look at the data they
mels/024703.pt|use the money to pay for their debts on the real estate side and basically shuddered how will this global collapse impact my channel points they'll be more valuable
mels/025374.pt|and uh and then they let me do it

mels/024680.pt|crypto is almost certainly at least for the foreseeable
mels/021439.pt|people don't actually have diamond hands
mels/026823.pt|in the world of marketing it is the one day of the entire year where the average person cares about watching ads
mels/012864.pt|maybe well i think it was high
mels/023873.pt|well here's the l where i got the l this is the l for

mels/000961.pt|they were congratulating me on my
mels/011595.pt|in five minutes ago but i just know you're so stupid
mels/027965.pt|i'm actually not opposed to it you guys know that in the past decade the big trend in the world of gaming has been towards live service games games that
mels/019694.pt|i would love to yeah reach out man actually
mels/030236.pt|the real question is why is lud wearing
mels/018080.pt|death and toss a pepsi to men and women stuck on a roof of a burning building is that they that is
mels/030682.pt|like he's like yeah he just it didn't you know and my mom
mels/021854.pt|this is amazon stock price over the years you might notice from when it was founded in
mels/029064.pt|what like i got no bruises on me he
mels/020480.pt|first time they're not they're not used to this the problem for cyberpunk is not sales damage currently
mels/017569.pt|to decrease the amount they spend on commercials advertising digital banner ads etc and yet they've built a brand
mels/025898.pt|support this type of workplace culture we're
mels/021644.pt|at the gm is finally flipping their stance from
mels/019853.pt|and uh anthem was supposed to join that
mels/015191.pt|have spider-man you'd have star wars et
mels/011642.pt|okay so so anyway but let me tell you my mind when
mels/000623.pt|baby the i'm over talking to your but it may me
mels/023067.pt|is the average amount an american
mels/020253.pt|a good holiday ad will be on the on the the feels
mels/031958.pt|where he worked for ludwig this a slime back when he worked for bts he produces event and at this point slimy where he worked for ludwig this is slime back when he worked for bts
mels/005013.pt|about twitter it must be hard to do due diligence when you have to father so
mels/017874.pt|i thought about marketing and internet providers comcast comes to mind because the major monopoly the thing about marketing for internet providers they don't have to they do it for like brand sentiment reasons but in general they are
mels/019151.pt|really basic graph this is how much
mels/029525.pt|for years and years and years these guys just didn't have a chance and so when
mels/027609.pt|was in their minds and then i think most of them though fall into this camp and i found a twitter employee that i think
mels/017454.pt|but i have one more big win and that is of course all of the men and women who have been striking against corporate america and otherwise over the past few weeks specifically i want to call out this person this nominee for person of the year this is a lone striker holding down the picket line for the
mels/017545.pt|that is worth more than the entire net worth of elon musk every single bitcoin in existence at the current market cap the entirety of walmart the entirety of target the entirety of boeing the entirety of coca-cola own every nfl
mels/022896.pt|time protect iphone users from viruses malware privacy attacks etc this is no easy task basically the core of
mels/014088.pt|that is when all the the the combatants had shown up and the war began beginning with probably ninja and drake in mid 20 late
mels/030289.pt|sir boys what's up boys what's up
mels/024911.pt|i have some pity rules in some
mels/007041.pt|what the us with no notches
mels/013059.pt|best teacher i ever had was one that wasn't beholden to a curriculum that checks out yeah it just makes sense
mels/016519.pt|in the world of esports was quake 2 for 34 i
mels/018334.pt|not paladin's the video game no not
mels/029138.pt|we would consult the helix fossil all the time like in game
mels/026408.pt|and the clock model is a way to think about any brand and in fact you can um you
mels/020409.pt|i think if this guy was like like just like totally slacking doesn't care and the elf would be super cute like the
mels/009276.pt|well i think they took it away it was like a one day thing it's gone i don't i don't
mels/005736.pt|i do think he's smart i think he i think he's
mels/032171.pt|i hit i hit the field i double up
mels/024850.pt|with friends okay this is the most common
mels/001024.pt|one my bad man it's not you're not
mels/005494.pt|and drink too much so when you have to hang out with a bunch of like extended relatives and everyone is sauced it's like
mels/031555.pt|is the best player in the world
mels/011488.pt|hey stevie blunder i love you know i love when people spam a huge
mels/007209.pt|if you didn't know if the offer was serious or whatever he was too
mels/020593.pt|it's known that in the profession of marketing every man woman and child's dream when they enter this business is to one day earn a monday it's a very
mels/029716.pt|and i think it was actually kind of dope that that's what the
mels/012104.pt|something like that right and so he's like
mels/010582.pt|or meow not if it's locked okay but let me i'm sorry
mels/013774.pt|here because i was worried that they were going to be even in more trouble after a leak came out this week that they were shredding documents related to their abuse investigation yeah this came out but who cares about this because bro overwatch mobile could be happening yeah
mels/008814.pt|will be hurt and if that's that's part of it i i i
mels/024701.pt|none of these ever actually were produced and guess what they raised billions this company just the car company was worth more than ford despite
mels/013147.pt|the more powerful overall media because people love games and if you can
mels/028769.pt|the and so bad dude i wanted it in so bad dude
mels/004963.pt|theme of what i'm talking about today is that the last three months have been absolutely awful for elon musk just a real collective
mels/009964.pt|jack novak should filibuster the courts maybe that would work if they get jake novak in they're doing fucking musical jake novak should filibuster the courts maybe that would work if they get jake
mels/010107.pt|that i'm good to go if there's anything i need to put on screen or anything for that i don't think so but
mels/018035.pt|called pepsi for some reason for some reason
mels/026036.pt|so you can find that compares to that is
mels/002061.pt|well this is what this is what
mels/011958.pt|i don't want to just be on the sidelines
mels/010463.pt|yo big a just called up my boy
mels/015457.pt|so for example let's go back to spider-man real quick
mels/016955.pt|but it was free so i still made like
mels/032069.pt|the one who wouldn't submit anything
mels/004960.pt|so yeah this is pretty much all laid out in my first video but
mels/006890.pt|you know whatever it had everything dude
mels/024632.pt|was colossally wrong and stupid basically if you want to know what
mels/011590.pt|want to have the same opinion as you it ruins it for me it makes me re-evaluate and my
mels/013143.pt|would i think of the rain it's
mels/017525.pt|were you guys to mean so now you can say yep clock
mels/018847.pt|well as emotionally mature as I'm sure all
mels/013046.pt|so the good teachers get shifted
mels/028812.pt|so so i lied but it worked out because i
mels/026249.pt|when it had a standing army and owned india but
mels/012455.pt|fire doesn't pay that great but he's super zealous but he's like what they make up in credits or
mels/028214.pt|oh you liked brood war oh you
mels/025070.pt|if you don't know what nestle makes it's pretty
mels/030186.pt|but then there was a big one that had the beginning to it was a giant rope climb like like this part but way taller and a rope climb up
mels/024068.pt|we've got a lot of things
mels/024674.pt|what we're hoping for to keep the gravy train rolling is for china to step in and
mels/009900.pt|but it's also like i don't trust that if i gave you a house you wouldn't become a
mels/016415.pt|benefits extremely because what happens is let's say there's a let's say there's only a million dollars in existence and they print four million
mels/019073.pt|i because um if a character in a show
mels/003637.pt|you know boomers are all reaching dying age of around you know late
mels/004293.pt|okay here it is here it is
mels/020824.pt|holy guys i did not expect this oh my
mels/024460.pt|ad campaign is really bad but
mels/019644.pt|i don't know if you saw it on there was the mcdonald's shingle
mels/017643.pt|opening a new store verizon spends four hundred thousand
mels/027616.pt|whatever direction he takes in mass fires whatever he does you're gonna have
mels/029939.pt|never been the ceiling mango's been at the top
mels/000472.pt|when you're like drunk you lay down you get
mels/001523.pt|i'm thinking about it every time here simple question that i'm sure you
mels/030561.pt|ever in the entire time was able to ask
mels/013778.pt|and have just begun to shred
mels/030424.pt|i'm being honest with you that the
mels/013288.pt|that i'll tell you about in a second
mels/006312.pt|sided with him an insane way on
mels/002297.pt|they're not faking their death they're gone for like weeks
mels/022027.pt|because if you get too risque or flamboyant the first reaction is often the permanent reaction
mels/026931.pt|and barbie found out about this dream house with an alert from rocket
mels/002509.pt|us today so i will have time i was thinking i would play elden ring or something after i'm done i
mels/027769.pt|what that was a while ago and people get better they improve their craft you
mels/004522.pt|by the way good birthday date
mels/018750.pt|it'll lower the price in fact i
mels/000620.pt|at the my life it was so cool that all my old
mels/025991.pt|you're off right with some terrible brand tweets the the
mels/007071.pt|i've never i've never it's never happened to
mels/004742.pt|twitter has tremendous potential i look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it this was april
mels/026958.pt|at their money's worth uh okay okay now
mels/024364.pt|didn't really make a lot of sense didn't make sense on branding but now that leaves us
mels/010541.pt|it out for sure for sure we'll figure it out
mels/018366.pt|there's just a few things that would help make it perfect
mels/021635.pt|let me give you my thoughts this is a good
mels/022659.pt|and 20 seconds to game peacefully
mels/010381.pt|really bad at this game actually
mels/025405.pt|if the funny if i live react to it on stream so despite the fact that it's been many many days now i actually i swear hand to god i have not watched this ad it's
mels/004674.pt|will you remember streaming fondly when you're sure you're certain
mels/023803.pt|it's just they're just prime they're just great
mels/013892.pt|watch it again watch it again you absolute nincompoop you probably didn't even reach hour five
mels/018189.pt|i'm not even showing on screen how
mels/017653.pt|well the product it signifies and
mels/007308.pt|and they lost they lost all their first bets but they
mels/014949.pt|it makes it a lot easier to track things that accounts normally take care of for example i don't have an accountant i used tax ninja that one time
mels/028565.pt|entire lump sum as income like
mels/015971.pt|is lost money every year of
mels/023495.pt|fucking month because they sell trucks every month
mels/018788.pt|i work in marketing professionally I
mels/020413.pt|i also think the elf could look different you coming and then why does he why does he invite him santa can't he's delivering what
mels/005068.pt|you know what it feels like uh
mels/006721.pt|this guy's a non-stop tweeter the veil
mels/027526.pt|what's the equivalent to tesla they spend 625
mels/017039.pt|what's up i haven't watched in a while i
mels/000884.pt|i could say anything you say
mels/032007.pt|in the scarf for not keeping up with melee but
mels/028804.pt|can reach for the stars hey
mels/000170.pt|how the hell did you a literal tiger yes
mels/009053.pt|bonnie think of the three sporadic space
mels/010466.pt|but uh turns out i've made a shift
mels/020123.pt|how to connect with their audience fries for your wait i want to see what
mels/006788.pt|i was sponsoring him for phantom his next major event
mels/023621.pt|of bars because it passes three tests okay the ingredients are natural they smell good and
mels/001949.pt|week vacation from work and it was just
mels/028863.pt|because a truck america needs a ray tracing
mels/026214.pt|and apparently this type of payment system is extremely popular
mels/023383.pt|as esports grows will any video game providers provide players with modern sports also level contracts yes esports will eventually have contracts as big as real sports now do i think that anyone will ever make that much money playing
mels/019425.pt|if you can mention maybe two to three of
mels/007156.pt|project which are almost entirely economic and if we can solve the big fundamental economic problems the rest of the stuff is so much minor in comparison that is my general opinion and i don't like to alienate people by taking
mels/014979.pt|all different weaknesses they have different strengths and it's hard to determine from the outside who's going
mels/010421.pt|the opposite i said the opposite but i
mels/018457.pt|was guy and i was like
mels/030504.pt|i do it and i'm like see you know the reason i brought up all those memories is because i don't want them to stop and i like look in her eyes and i
mels/016907.pt|and that leads you to me
mels/002469.pt|if they weren't like you know what i'm saying it
mels/020952.pt|if i'm in a conversation with somebody
mels/027273.pt|i think brands like ubisoft may not
mels/017649.pt|and this has led to a
mels/012628.pt|it's see the floor up there right you can't see
mels/016592.pt|it's a genius idea they just made like
mels/013038.pt|i'll be the good one to balance
mels/005714.pt|on grass at a mall and we're
mels/026231.pt|a the credit card and if you pay up a credit card every month it's the exact same
mels/008668.pt|italy removing gel mails is impossible on your
mels/030133.pt|dad was awake and around for at least at least i mean uh probably
mels/022672.pt|sometimes a company will buy a company for a lot of money
mels/015505.pt|speaking of uh stock market let's go to
mels/020393.pt|make the brother the present yeah we'll have the parents die and then we'll have the two brothers stare in each other's eyes and call each
mels/000456.pt|we just feel that like i passed the line i
mels/027554.pt|act out and he said nah i'm
mels/011056.pt|to know why you're ending a seven year friendship by the way can i be honest with you outside of
mels/020198.pt|this is going to be a slam dunk within five minutes it was clear that people weren't going to harp on about the time they got a free extra sauce with their mcnuggets instead they were going to tell
mels/032180.pt|it's saturday the accountants of the palazzo casino will remember bloody saturday for days to come because i came back swinging i took out fifteen hundred dollars and i came back
mels/006999.pt|and so i got like i got to see some people that watch the stream which is
mels/016836.pt|in the future will see a lot of uh potential
mels/027947.pt|and down so you can like almost do
mels/012293.pt|suffice to say i fold i fall i
mels/025079.pt|number five most hated company in america
mels/009712.pt|play hitman and i'll give your new video
mels/001288.pt|that's good you know what though i think i mean literally i'm
mels/004364.pt|said exactly what i was thinking
mels/006517.pt|and they start throwing a ton of fees and
mels/016448.pt|in their disposable income as inflation continues to climb and gas prices go up that means more hours employees will need to work to maintain their current level of living we're no
mels/015443.pt|these biggest hits do star wars uh marvel
mels/031206.pt|those are the kind of clips that really rocked back then
mels/026068.pt|industries thank god these people finally got a win spider-man alone was
mels/022342.pt|no explanation and i that literally was because
mels/007161.pt|parts of the country have different opinions that are based on your surroundings
mels/003373.pt|is because he got out just in time
mels/011945.pt|i can't imagine it wasn't that many people so it helps with the
mels/021730.pt|good 30 second ad right off the bat
mels/009595.pt|they already are dude dota is a muddy depressing game nobody who know life's dota feels good about
mels/027600.pt|the tweet no shot he said today
mels/019798.pt|the hype for the game was so much that legendary pictures the the people that made
mels/001035.pt|i have thoughts in the back and
mels/003170.pt|is tick tock and this is the biggest problem of all because it's cutting into their current profits not just their future
mels/027951.pt|in the public let's go to a fail now that of
mels/015752.pt|that is the big consumer change that's the future we're headed to is that customers are getting more savvy about abusing free trials and one month payments to buy everything because if you think about it look if i want to
mels/028586.pt|and i got quite high i got let me show you let me show you where i got it will shock and all you
mels/024042.pt|and everyone hated new coke and they demanded to bring back the old coke and they got all rallied up about
mels/025242.pt|the west banned kids from playing games the
mels/029144.pt|he ate pokemon red i looked at it like
mels/016619.pt|are the number of babies being born is uh

mels/016090.pt|and i have their other social
mels/019398.pt|and i put this in a slide that i showed in front of the entire class
mels/019244.pt|what are the what is the advantage
mels/003322.pt|everyone who did that workers who switched jobs received wage increases over of
mels/014652.pt|getting not on a wednesday it's not marketing though is it right it's marketing
mels/008046.pt|is whenever there was a toad on screen everyone would say do the toad voice and i would and it would hurt my
mels/021242.pt|because as you can see from this graph is now massively massively bigger than films or music green is films
mels/015060.pt|worth so they got friends on netflix friends
mels/021441.pt|odd thing now but i have to be honest here and this is where people
mels/020204.pt|if stories on the hashtag within two hours they pulled down the advertising campaign and
mels/021630.pt|is that was actually pretty solid again
mels/019997.pt|i think the best media acquisition of all time some of you guys are not
mels/028888.pt|call me back home safely but apparently one of the first things i did was try to dance with this girl and what
mels/009138.pt|if the fanboys that i said a mild scent
mels/006074.pt|add of nowhere and took a stake
mels/008365.pt|codified system but it is not one person being greedy that is correct it's not like
mels/011561.pt|is that there's not enough marvel movie jokes in it
mels/010222.pt|they just kind of walked in and saw that
mels/021351.pt|high point now i had no idea
mels/009139.pt|the praise and they loved it they weren't even responding to the facts of the
mels/014719.pt|at me was it like did he like try to look really jacked and say like really intelligent stuff or what
mels/031365.pt|in feeling it stan's myself ludwig and our
mels/001935.pt|like really grind up or i
mels/019779.pt|they lied they openly lied dude they
mels/019774.pt|watch dogs now the reason it's number
mels/021985.pt|a little bummed okay i have never seen my dad that tired he is exhausted and i know how
mels/013895.pt|boring preamble to what will probably be a good movie the second dude will be fire the first new movie
mels/011839.pt|the to you um they're all in character and the
mels/010577.pt|open the door and let him out he wants to
mels/024161.pt|because when ninja came back from mixer he did that
mels/031993.pt|we've been disappearing from the scene
mels/004271.pt|what if you invent a crypto that just can't go down just like it's part of it like
mels/019230.pt|families but as a teenage boy was like damn dude you guys know in Japan like
mels/016802.pt|are entering the global economy they'll need
mels/030698.pt|he's a loser like and it was like
mels/017769.pt|or audience and that can work but i think
mels/014041.pt|feel so much more possible and safe to give youtube
mels/014950.pt|word through all of san francisco and beg him on the last
mels/028933.pt|the shows me in the bathroom
mels/001749.pt|it's just literally it's the old man like smiling and walking away with his son as this guy drowns to death behind the
mels/031089.pt|don't quit i said you're good at this
mels/023655.pt|it's good for their brand the the magic of flight it's really creative it's really clever and it's a really cool
mels/008747.pt|and again these type of tender offers
mels/015572.pt|and it turns out that roku has been actually quite successful during the pandemic uh right around the
mels/011317.pt|big a confirmed on my end
mels/020483.pt|what you all know and love the witcher 3.
mels/023323.pt|i outside of a club and hassan and i were waiting the guy asked us for a photo
mels/022409.pt|they managed to keep their logo front and center for the entire thing it's 60 unbroken seconds of using a
mels/026443.pt|it's after you become part of the mango
mels/012936.pt|you know a lot of traditional marketing
mels/000380.pt|saturday night's one of the best nights
mels/001139.pt|well it's not 8 o'clock yet
mels/012800.pt|and i was trying to get my name out there so i would only play pantheon twisted
mels/031122.pt|it's only because you have to look at other streamers on twitch it's it's like
mels/015754.pt|and so people are kind of abusing
mels/006760.pt|taking the stupidest parts of youtube and absolutely roasting it
mels/016879.pt|and they're watching twitch which they're watching right now
mels/017126.pt|thank you for your 12 months oh
mels/029668.pt|less than a 5-0 it wouldn't be such a
mels/001833.pt|in the next week would be like ah get rid
mels/015200.pt|and audiences are still watching them it was
mels/002326.pt|we're going to watch somebody really funny oh
mels/025992.pt|we're supposed to be part of a campaign they weren't approved tweets but they
mels/016223.pt|i think let me get my song ready here
mels/026186.pt|this fail is on arcane last week i talked about
mels/022960.pt|licensing they basically make the engine for like every popular game and they made about
mels/026090.pt|it's been really hanging out with other human
mels/018010.pt|i didn't get to see all of it because it
mels/018294.pt|you got here first yes i know that
mels/003632.pt|i guess that's good that's better the i guess that's good that's better than her outliving you man
mels/026254.pt|elon musk every single bitcoin in existence at the current market cap the entirety of walmart the entirety of target the entirety of boeing the entirety of coca-cola own every nfl franchise
mels/001242.pt|it's not so wild that someone would get fired but it's like not so boring or bland that it gets no engagement like it's fun they have fun questions they
mels/008158.pt|what he's doing and why he's coming on in
mels/002041.pt|i hate boba and i have crucifix earrings
mels/017261.pt|of many many crimes and likely
mels/009472.pt|or how little he'd played smite
mels/029653.pt|and i like what she's talking to
mels/007223.pt|he gets a little nervous i
mels/022697.pt|at to sell that many ads and they start like desperately calling everybody and trying to sell the ads and what they realize is most big
mels/006581.pt|sweep just to get the last little bit so that's how they can afford the space lasers not because the movie's a
mels/023378.pt|so just be careful if you're going to drop
mels/014545.pt|i do i think he likes the freedom i think he gets paid per project he's also really
mels/005946.pt|but end of the day all this stuff is
mels/026680.pt|of all the teams people are gonna have to spend millions more bits on their aces high london spitfire cheer modes only it turns out people don't spend money watching esports events they don't subscribe they'll give their money to
mels/001040.pt|i can interest rates yeah there's a video i have all about it hey big
mels/022858.pt|what you're doing is corrupt he said right here i found this line they said
mels/005816.pt|i think i thought it would be like years before he'd ever be able to even get a a
mels/020877.pt|most companies won't even offer it and so the government stepped in to do like this fake fire insurance because you need it so if there ever is like a catastrophic fire or hurricane it's
mels/001743.pt|where the deck and then i'll fall overboard and they'll call for help and then we'll turn around so he walks up to a stranger
mels/010699.pt|the good days like the days where
mels/026366.pt|it worked quite well because when people spend a lot of money on a product the fact
mels/003976.pt|the vote bald no matter who
mels/009451.pt|it is a thing of beauty and it looked like just judging from the
mels/003461.pt|that's the reason it needs to stay open and uh not
mels/016613.pt|not i can't do it all here but
mels/004521.pt|and you next to her typing this
mels/025845.pt|to make some money a blizzard cinematic was better than the world of warcraft movie and maybe blizzard a company that could have done this that had years of excellent
mels/008360.pt|i wouldn't worry about him i i think you yeah i would worry about
mels/003096.pt|if the that but i'll i'll save it for a second uh
mels/010714.pt|if you grow up in a tax bracket it's only
mels/006862.pt|like me with who that in the back area
mels/030434.pt|and this dinner but like that was like well into our trip as you guys notice i
mels/002636.pt|oh i'm sure the kids don't need the money come on they're fine they have their youth
mels/017554.pt|one of them being you know this past year massive money printing by the government but in general
mels/027233.pt|this made some developers angry and
mels/018632.pt|for gamers today is like most
mels/007891.pt|and where he said yep coke now normally i think all yep cup messages are stupid but maybe
mels/001463.pt|he gets there you picked two of the worst people i
mels/005085.pt|let's see what the best tweets of the june and july basically
mels/003707.pt|it starts selling really well amazon will
mels/029411.pt|or for 30 minutes while everyone's paying
mels/013002.pt|worried about learning this one thing in math you could actually get it i think that's the way to learn i think i think
mels/019261.pt|and I certainly didn't remember them
mels/021378.pt|sort of short is okay so i take her shares i sell them immediately at
mels/031081.pt|it'd be bigger than he was number one was that
mels/021580.pt|but if i say okay i'm gonna go to
mels/031629.pt|and i remember i sat next to
mels/017961.pt|in in-person time hanging out with friends
mels/031859.pt|was a fad that was not
mels/011034.pt|i was going to be no content until i know what
mels/031350.pt|she's like well there's not much i can do like you can't i can't let you off but given your circumstances and that you're here for a school trip and
mels/010783.pt|there are two balloons inside of
mels/019848.pt|and this one's a doozy this one
mels/024109.pt|this is the future of marketing
mels/024726.pt|okay no today was not the brunt of it
mels/014610.pt|the stream this many hours and run this many ads youtube is less strict on that which means if you're someone like
mels/008358.pt|i you know destruction of savings will ludwig survive the recession
mels/014257.pt|more influence among influencers than they
mels/026991.pt|the pretty like random tuesday watching modern family ads you know what i'm saying they're not they
mels/012530.pt|i don't regret it at all for that reason alone but i'm just talking about it was
mels/032151.pt|a squad and everyone's rolling having to get time i roll a squad and everyone's rolling having a good time
mels/023028.pt|one could lose money i i would like a world where this
mels/006367.pt|in the mouth of rolling for it it's
mels/010679.pt|chimps there's no way because i feel like everyone wants to do
mels/002617.pt|we're letting it ride heads heads tails donate to charity
mels/026908.pt|kind of like it's like the was up ad back in
mels/019936.pt|is the oil market for years and years and years and
mels/013762.pt|i know that we have phones please give us more mobile game content of your main already dying ips poggies and i thought blizzard was out
mels/025800.pt|the game in the couch cushions and riot games just dropped two games out of nowhere they're tossing them
mels/023224.pt|but i'm also not stupid i know that most of the things i eat when i don't pay attention are unhealthy
mels/019041.pt|i just got a million followers right but what do they get on the average posts fourteen retweets one hundred likes right i mean this is crap they don't they have a i just got a million followers right but what do they get on the average post 14 retweets 100 likes right
mels/010697.pt|that's not good that's not i work retail to take
mels/012903.pt|so when i decided to leave twitch i had an offer from blizzard and an offer from
mels/001441.pt|i don't remember having any reason to ban psychic from the
mels/008861.pt|where all these lawyers that get
mels/029040.pt|and i'm thinking in my head what the
mels/021226.pt|was which is the office plus like bonus office features
mels/025574.pt|i posted on twitter and most importantly i got thousands of likes the good thing about getting that prediction right
mels/025113.pt|baby formula stuff where they were like tricking mothers
mels/004193.pt|on the line all you know
mels/028056.pt|it's been completely shut down the last factory closed there is no more ipods this was really a breakthrough
mels/019703.pt|in that conversation is that number one the autozone ceo responded to him that's cool you know maybe they're not going to use it there's probably some rights issues actually from using an employee's song
mels/031781.pt|even since this first one which was only a few months ago the
mels/022625.pt|and what's funny is none of my co-workers believed
mels/018119.pt|you can tell your kids that you were here this is a real game people bought this game
mels/028054.pt|if the wins and fail show number one i'd like you all to say a farewell to the ipod it may not have
mels/029612.pt|they didn't even care zayn's beyond that zayn
mels/000429.pt|and ludwig's joining me everyone else
mels/014210.pt|but in terms of live which is growing rapidly and nobody wants to get disrupted by you think about facebook getting disrupted by
mels/018413.pt|actual cringe alert it's the only way to get through this whole
mels/007453.pt|and who ended up winning the tournament and i asked zane the night before i was like
mels/022055.pt|what was trending when you use this
mels/015773.pt|it's not going to last you know hulu might stick around as like a place to hold stuff but eventually all of its
mels/003593.pt|so that that era that like
mels/001552.pt|how do you know about death valley
mels/011876.pt|there is a event happening and you are part of the play it's larping yeah yeah i didn't know it's going
mels/003554.pt|too much and didn't know what i was
mels/030017.pt|you're saying it'll prove your point that there's a lot of like
mels/004684.pt|that it's almost an advantage then it's almost an advantage
mels/007547.pt|that was one of the worst parts by the way that was one of the worst parts was that was
mels/016969.pt|it seems pretty good seems pretty good um so i think i will
mels/001008.pt|actually going on maya what's going on
mels/002027.pt|interesting i don't i can't say that i love that perspective
mels/012524.pt|that's just my opinion that being said for me
mels/030501.pt|i can get it out but i do get it up
mels/002463.pt|and they found that there was consumers who were like they they called them like
mels/021821.pt|i want richest man in the world i think he recently re-passed elon musk
mels/016093.pt|right here is just a few of their episodes
mels/025360.pt|would disqualify me and they were like oh you
mels/017272.pt|that being said it's actually not all available i'm sorry to call that a dub
mels/005246.pt|walk to her friends were chilling and
mels/023582.pt|well that movie came out whenever fallout came out
mels/030379.pt|with the different line and you put the ring on your dick right is that what you think i did you think i took the ring out of the bag mid
mels/016717.pt|what the public that's very clever you should make a
mels/024982.pt|wish bag you do not fit in
mels/016710.pt|when i got completely canned and that wasn't
mels/019002.pt|she's had a backstory we can talk about
mels/008182.pt|i wish that were true if only we lived in a world where minions day was every day but that's not the case that being said i will be eating another one of those meals because there was a hamburger
mels/015936.pt|or not they're not they're not
mels/011466.pt|i do love hipping and hopping
mels/026878.pt|the concept of the ad is a coliseum tailgate
mels/012586.pt|in time and now i have like two and a half grand of disney stock in
mels/032349.pt|install the ghost mod it took me an hour on
mels/018564.pt|lost the war hard as i mentioned
mels/023246.pt|pop tarts it also cost more and there was less
mels/026446.pt|that has sold more subs than almost any
mels/032087.pt|i think this is when it turns i think
mels/003602.pt|the bay's so goddamn expensive i'm
mels/015730.pt|what does happen and i did mention this you actually tell me this is true what what everyone is starting to what does happen and i didn't mention this actually tell me if this is true
mels/028225.pt|it's pretty split behind the scenes over
mels/001107.pt|i heard anyway whatever you're into
mels/004511.pt|right now happy birthday okay that should i should wrap things up
mels/009206.pt|one of those games where you gotta you gotta play a lot bit to get better there's no there's no shortcut
mels/020958.pt|fucking wrong you're an idiot but if they go you got a point this is and then i go well actually you know
mels/015460.pt|they have no yeah i said
mels/001928.pt|the the thing i said was the only thing that scares me or worries me or makes me you know try to change things or find a
mels/008527.pt|is there a point to buy twitter
mels/031640.pt|and i think because i was wearing all the team liquid merch and i said that
mels/001318.pt|money that there's like there's like a
mels/015495.pt|it's worth exactly the same as them
mels/011776.pt|you can already tell that i have two
mels/004971.pt|right when he was fathering secret children
mels/004041.pt|yeah that was very very very annoying i'm glad i did not do it live because i
mels/025003.pt|have that deal that they were gonna
mels/018036.pt|one has to ask themselves why is pepsi
mels/002605.pt|i have to get heads or tails from you
mels/006646.pt|i didn't is it good for today though i
mels/026665.pt|is going to explain he was a major major major believer he was a major believer that professionalized
mels/002643.pt|this is gonna be great okay this one is
mels/030405.pt|i have a ring and then he gets it
mels/024206.pt|if conor the ninja of twitch leaves
mels/030226.pt|two different races there's a different race where there was a ground slide contention where i made it to the bottom of the slide and he touched the ground first that i think will go down in history as one of the great debates of all time the the pace yourself story was just a pure win by him and i i give him credit
mels/010981.pt|which one then immediately the other
mels/026864.pt|the q score or whatever hers is probably literally off the charts so
mels/006279.pt|evan gao is auctioning off that poster of my dad that
mels/013007.pt|at first pass of an idea i just think like
mels/007545.pt|it was world war ii era struggle food
mels/030157.pt|and start from behind and i still i lost my one
mels/031878.pt|for that world so this is a fake circle for clint sach i wish he had streamed but if
mels/021989.pt|on the internet for good just yet that's the end your next stop now though assuming you have uh less morals than me
mels/026412.pt|that's what dealerships are better they have a better purchase experience which makes their brand stronger post purchase they have
mels/008536.pt|we'd already signed the deal and they
mels/028932.pt|in the first weird champ i think diego's face was the pioneer of weird champ i think he gave me the very first i think he was the first person to really like isolate that
mels/002519.pt|heads or tails you're hurt yeah i'm hurt having to read your goddamn
mels/001875.pt|well i checked out twitch and uh
mels/018841.pt|what a journey please write the ad boys I want
mels/031545.pt|the of units that the protoss
mels/018793.pt|what do you think rate this ad chad has
mels/012862.pt|and i started doing more classes and stuff
mels/019391.pt|this leapfrog so this is where jason came in and
mels/030047.pt|stanford thing yeah the stanford prison experiment you know what that one was right where they gave the students power and the other students were prisoners and it turns out
mels/014425.pt|is that we've seen the history of the internet that when new media formats come out usually only one company wins okay for images it's instagram for short form videos
mels/019037.pt|was disgust i mean there's people that were like really pissed about this there was people going hey don't
mels/007313.pt|why do together and they'd walk up to my chair in the front row and be like okay um how about seven to one
mels/013613.pt|it happened four hours ago but
mels/003215.pt|infinity for them like they would buy them the pokemon give it to their accounts they would level them up by
mels/003584.pt|your whole life for assets to grow
mels/021334.pt|people are getting more anxious and they are getting more sad these are real facts that we need to confront and address
mels/026495.pt|in the contents of the collected storyboards of
mels/007741.pt|with friends and let's just say my passive income covered the bill easy clap so you mean like you made everyone else pay and you just sort of sat there
mels/013324.pt|even though i am really strong
mels/024017.pt|i don't pay out that's when things go
mels/028934.pt|this giant trash bag full of vomit which he has yet to throw out i guess he just
mels/024207.pt|well there's nothing left the culture
mels/018733.pt|so this let's go into this on the marketing side this is the flex factor case study okay year over year over year iphone sales were doing great they were crushing iphone was the
mels/022157.pt|ads from now on to save time that i've started to rise in the past basically nine ten years every year because we see two million ads a year they have ads from now on to save time that have started to rise in the past basically nine ten years
mels/028655.pt|i find this shirt i say this is perfect and i buy it immediately okay i don't know why they're like okay okay
mels/007984.pt|done enough because you guys don't

mels/001261.pt|i mean company account let me see
mels/021138.pt|it's already off to an interesting start there's good reason for my glistening skin and how i shine
mels/012195.pt|i was like babe can you please leave that very
mels/017788.pt|now i think for example at the end of my stream when everyone
mels/022652.pt|you've settled into an intense gaming session you're just getting to the good part and
mels/016738.pt|oh you know a huge amount of our methane emissions come from cows

mels/018675.pt|the quote from the prime minister of great britain but it was pretty close europe was pretty close and japan was a thousand
mels/011260.pt|watch stranger things in the dark they didn't see anything it was pretty awesome yeah that sounds good though whoa fall guys
mels/016244.pt|on twitter who did some uh
mels/012958.pt|it's just my opinion though again
mels/032226.pt|i i i am like wow ludwig who's got more money
mels/022899.pt|that money because we provide a great service because of it we use the money to stop malware stop viruses to weed out bad stuff we need that money if you don't like it
mels/031232.pt|at esports secretly because i love them and i was also like
mels/019420.pt|at walt disney i didn't you
mels/016628.pt|of them were in the last 20 years
mels/002654.pt|i god what a profile picture that is
mels/022011.pt|that's what the internet is the internet is the bully and you are trying to do some kind of wordplay creative it
mels/017573.pt|when that happens before you buy the item purchase
mels/023427.pt|as i've seen of success with the people that i've met like
mels/004628.pt|many different crypto based moon shots
mels/002109.pt|actually let's find the clip right now let's find
mels/021720.pt|so i'm gonna put this in c for cringe next one is
mels/024555.pt|i think and it's going to be a real
mels/010106.pt|or saturdays and let me just confirm confirm
mels/004546.pt|seems kind of goofy and i was like
mels/029303.pt|in this industry i know some people let me
mels/025628.pt|so if you are a pc gamer this is a win and this is a product of pretty unique market dynamics i mean this is a
mels/006479.pt|the confidence is probably best tied to activity in strip clubs and
mels/016685.pt|the that of aluminum and and steel and bolts and and you had a little bit of wiring in there and that's it now
mels/014490.pt|i figured he could help us explain what's going on first i found this amazing metaphor by
mels/009435.pt|i need right now because that
mels/001518.pt|and all i want to ask you is are you
mels/011808.pt|with the screen so i'm looking out and it's like they're stars whooshing by and
mels/027668.pt|and until you have a billion tomatoes and then you're a billionaire you sell those
mels/027329.pt|why making less people able to beat it it feels more accomplishing for those that do now the downside of that is this as the game has gotten more accessible and
mels/021265.pt|it also have more games out of the gate
mels/031852.pt|a non-stop league million dollar teams
mels/007809.pt|then i have a marketing monday that's like pretty ready enough ready that i think i could do it today or ipso facto we
mels/018623.pt|okay the first year they did this they
mels/008151.pt|we've been disabled i thought i already did that but now i've done it
mels/030142.pt|i read an article about cyberpunk
mels/007760.pt|i was getting ready for stream i took a
mels/031831.pt|amaranth are the most likely to watch nasa which proves that she did not cheat
mels/024425.pt|i actually think maybe it's in the it might be in the replies yeah there's this lion one
mels/027162.pt|wait the currency enough your debt is worthless the
mels/003842.pt|someone like the rock for example is liked by republicans and democrats alike the values
mels/030312.pt|the show up to his wedding dressed head
mels/019195.pt|and also get back at Nintendo launched
mels/027441.pt|be quiet though you can't tell anybody that
mels/001032.pt|thoughts on the latest tft patch what you
mels/020726.pt|in the month of this post
mels/009589.pt|does led play league in his free time
mels/019417.pt|with the your votes and my knowledge the greatest marketing and the worst marketing jingles of all time first of
mels/012066.pt|i was into it he had the most banter he remembered
mels/008523.pt|i wanted to get some kind of profit
mels/017150.pt|we've never thought of crow workers
mels/008631.pt|and that's losing money if i give you a
mels/000954.pt|even better you know because you get
mels/029129.pt|with area full of ledges that the player can't transcend
mels/001719.pt|the one that really stuck with me
mels/019436.pt|i'm planning to end production of its weedy
mels/023734.pt|the important to me but they're uh
mels/011932.pt|dude comes out he looks like this i got a
mels/008570.pt|what you know so yeah whatever
mels/007738.pt|josh pitt they have a two
mels/029585.pt|if you remember the last time we did a reads episode in person
mels/009687.pt|or payment locked in probably more than
mels/010861.pt|but you know that's that's not necessarily the
mels/024384.pt|was the two minute cut down so we actually
mels/012468.pt|and i guess sammy sammy shoots
mels/017736.pt|and value rather than having again a better
mels/004972.pt|his political stances all seem to be based on things coming from his own personal life that he
mels/029397.pt|i have embarrassed myself enough today i am not going to turn over to the
mels/008010.pt|that i am deeply enamored with
mels/003161.pt|heavily into facebook's profits and ability to track and
mels/009606.pt|like at a certain amount of deaths a player
mels/013810.pt|and not make the games exclusive and it was announced this week revealed sorry
mels/002883.pt|so that what he loses the court case he spends a smaller amount of money it's actually a very unique rail an interesting so that when he loses the court case he spends a smaller amount of money
mels/020453.pt|the up with that actually because i think it'll
mels/030444.pt|beach but there's like a lot of people around all right it's
mels/007134.pt|it's like you're no longer required to bear a
mels/001780.pt|it's not appropriate no at the end of the day the lifetime
mels/026867.pt|back to the product but it was still
mels/015579.pt|started going outside again but roku kept shooting up roku has continued to grow because roku offers a really easy way
mels/014551.pt|streaming group that youtube did reach out to me i can
mels/024595.pt|today's wins and fails is unique
mels/022797.pt|dollars in outstanding debt on the
mels/016087.pt|you found this is a spoon it appears
mels/023176.pt|right now off camera because like the picture on the right is
mels/013328.pt|i can't even trust you guys you
mels/010104.pt|if the that kind of thing and if
mels/016170.pt|and that's how i stay fit and get and get around
mels/008793.pt|i mean there is a world where he is ordered to pay x amount of billion to twitter says no
mels/027061.pt|let me tell you something you know what's
mels/020631.pt|of my anger is that this is a disingenuous
mels/030520.pt|i love her more than me
mels/017595.pt|and out so this is an example of different areas on the clock that you could target
mels/014417.pt|for the nuclear bombs and that's where i
mels/008969.pt|basically the only argument that i've seen that
mels/012563.pt|by the way paper hands it was literally like the peak i couldn't have sold at a better time if
mels/004756.pt|secured against his tesla stock that was
mels/010091.pt|that can come with your box if you get factor
mels/014125.pt|i call the poor house years okay this is the empty wallet years this
mels/014403.pt|well let me put it this way me and ludwig both hire a guy named phineas j to do our vaude channel
mels/029132.pt|downers dude people would jump in
mels/001464.pt|well i don't know why none of our allies
mels/026938.pt|that are all buying hounds right now this is
mels/002708.pt|to walk away how about this you can stop now and take
mels/021932.pt|in the past all right there was still new
mels/002163.pt|the no one cares about put it all into a video and uh and you're set
mels/027984.pt|right before the crash and they saw
mels/011490.pt|okay that's that we're gonna try a little bit
mels/020387.pt|it's a great it's really good i mean this is a
mels/013467.pt|no it's not based that's that's wild i'm not saying i haven't done it a couple
mels/001333.pt|i couldn't believe it it was a it was a very sturdy
mels/027364.pt|well you can keep up over all your games of course they've done it
mels/029762.pt|i am in my twitch days i am so glad i went to europe a couple
mels/014022.pt|if the with the main event we're gonna talk about
mels/000014.pt|that's crazy there's no way dude no i don't have
mels/017195.pt|the of that i am a hero little do you know
mels/020487.pt|the witcher uh battle arena is another
mels/014918.pt|of business and marketing and the world of the past week me
mels/024937.pt|i can throw the credit card down they do not want to actually have to get better because psychologically that is seemingly baked into our brains it's
mels/006736.pt|even slightly bigger i've never gone outside
mels/020745.pt|it's a bad in january is truly impressive but what i think is extra based about this ad
mels/002365.pt|it's equally important that i sort of knock you down a peg
mels/015297.pt|in billion so that's half of what netflix spent on content for the whole year
mels/032335.pt|with only two of those being in the final phase he also didn't use
mels/010583.pt|be understanding here you walk up to locked doors and then you
mels/022102.pt|hey look they have guidelines and like you cannot show anything that gives away a customer's name except the internet undefeated found
mels/007559.pt|so he's like take my phone i'll find it
mels/021771.pt|okay well that's the first time
mels/019050.pt|because there's so much more coming i decided i've
mels/019278.pt|exclusive drops you can actually buy one of these in a store this thing and this thing are both selling out doesn't matter if you have great games doesn't
mels/017875.pt|there are monopolies they spend the money to like most of what they spend the money you to seem like less there are monopolies they spend the money to like most of what they spend the money unless it seems like less of an evil company
mels/017470.pt|false information about the strike were taken down or or you know attacked by redditors anyway
mels/003616.pt|that type i think that's really cool i didn't with my dad back at the time i was
mels/028131.pt|a bunch of companies were skipping the process going public making a bunch of money from investors
mels/029804.pt|if the for sweet and i remember you know you weren't really
mels/013144.pt|year to come from games than two games if this halo tv series
mels/015378.pt|like succession and game of thrones and outside of the final season and
mels/008347.pt|the president will come to your house personally and give you
mels/007577.pt|yeah okay i'll get right on it
mels/008964.pt|million dollars on twitter that's what it
mels/030645.pt|if the if you get a question wrong you
mels/021801.pt|it's not even a good depiction of both sides
mels/012549.pt|they just have me fake kill people
mels/008062.pt|i can definitely talk to you who that but i have a sneaky feeling it's not really important i have a sneaky feeling that you are abusing i can definitely talk to you who that but i have a sneaking feeling it's not really important
mels/029677.pt|what else who got an old legend to come back for evo but by beating their
mels/031145.pt|there's nothing wrong with if you have a hundred thousand viewers
mels/022074.pt|in the matter most brand fails
mels/026405.pt|then having again a better advertisement
mels/014688.pt|at on wednesday is live and then i added
mels/030818.pt|it's not that weak it was a normal apple
mels/012895.pt|well i mean the best decision i ever made was
mels/012124.pt|i of together but we already know
mels/002626.pt|it has to be reversed okay so instead of heads heads tails
mels/017387.pt|as but this is just mcu
mels/021127.pt|and i mean if it was like on purpose like man let's make it so cringy people talk
mels/020873.pt|too risky what if there's a hurricane if
mels/031718.pt|for these soldiers i want to see what they look like the
mels/007114.pt|why the vaccine isn't real and i was like
mels/001050.pt|while the old had to remember when we did dota
mels/012507.pt|for margins i think they let a lot of fat extra to make money also i've lost way more than five k in vegas for margins i think they left a lot of fat extra to make money
mels/027555.pt|why the whole company and then they started to
mels/002549.pt|as you didn't have before could be yours do you double down and go for one more again the time is ticking
mels/032312.pt|that's why for the past five streams or whatever
mels/021872.pt|wrote except for those texts you sent to
mels/020110.pt|the scale of this number is so high you can't really see the changes here but apple's revenue was going down so it was a company that was on the verge of death it was doing terribly so when he joined it truly did turn around a company that was feeling
mels/006050.pt|it's like dude this is a wendy's it's like
mels/021503.pt|and they have to get it down quickly so
mels/012513.pt|the smallest room so technically we could have added
mels/011666.pt|the five hour flight to florida to the to the orlando disney world where they have built a gigantic
mels/011474.pt|you know but also you have to be like you know
mels/026417.pt|well better about it so they're just stuck in this mindset and it's one of the most inexpensive and inefficient ways to do it but this kind of ways
mels/008488.pt|middle ground you guys bring brazil to me middle ground that seems fair everyone in brazil and the culture get up go up south america we'll even meet in the middle okay i'll meet you guys in
mels/007446.pt|i got to hang out with a lot of
mels/009283.pt|we'll just answer questions while that's what
mels/015207.pt|when you could win the entire globe they
mels/016438.pt|to like a real world one of satan's demons okay and if i had to pick of all the jobs in the world who was most likely to be one of the real world satans demons it
mels/007883.pt|a few months ago and then you
mels/010032.pt|because of course every single unfunny person is
mels/008675.pt|whether or not there's more bots is almost
mels/000804.pt|i was like you know what i'm not gonna really
mels/008463.pt|it's a big guy your favorite sub is back for
mels/014465.pt|as deals that's his story to tell everyone
mels/003023.pt|when we search for amc norwalk which is but it's like so
mels/025209.pt|we player that game is like part of a skinner box to be
mels/014445.pt|it's not insurmountable but their main thing is just way more broadcasters oh
mels/002693.pt|the table i have to legally tell you there's no penalty but if you'd like to walk away just giving you that option we're
mels/000144.pt|if those don't sell it's stupid and
mels/032066.pt|all day trying to get our scripts ahead
mels/027245.pt|what gamers think are responding to and
mels/016399.pt|the were able to stay afloat but in general the vast majority of
mels/017290.pt|i can get three free months of
mels/017528.pt|is to answer the question about what is marketing that's not advertising i think
mels/016906.pt|if the business is growing dramatically
mels/009012.pt|and people jump in and we just have a little fun
mels/000660.pt|and i think ludwig was doing the thing we had done the day before where he was running over to
mels/013196.pt|like i'm joking i'm not i'm being
mels/020890.pt|technology isn't far as far along as the media makes you think it is we're five years away from autonomous
mels/004451.pt|today i feel like you never get thanked
mels/007181.pt|a new york just saying like man
mels/017457.pt|visual representation of a person sort
mels/014809.pt|okay let's start with this one wait
mels/009112.pt|in the middle of the day
mels/010352.pt|sounds like my first grade birthday
mels/010524.pt|well we'll talk about it you know it's
mels/018953.pt|all the stars weren't big enough oh the
mels/019859.pt|of matrix mania the matrix sequels had done huge
mels/007351.pt|is the sheik that was probably
mels/024217.pt|the monday today is a good one the
mels/015473.pt|if the on disney required you to spend an extra
mels/015788.pt|as and those are for making money off niche audiences
mels/020867.pt|of california i'm not for all of it but in general a lot of it is like i just
mels/027315.pt|extremely important to them in that way do you know what i'm saying in a world where it's hard to make progress on things and accomplish things which is true
mels/023549.pt|all the competition and then you that's how you do you outlast your competition you lower the price outlast competition and then
mels/030456.pt|it was like it was low-key it
mels/026086.pt|they just found a different white guy
mels/014559.pt|the contract's not in that way
mels/022091.pt|just quickly make sure we add the logo to that image we don't want people ripping that off from us i guess my one piece of advice to social media
mels/024744.pt|i right around the millennium they start to add mobile you might notice mobile has gone from a little bit of gaming revenue
mels/001588.pt|and the winter i'm the winner i'm the
mels/009286.pt|devs nowadays how can we escape this what do you mean speak on that the money grab mindset of game devs i think the reason game devs
mels/008001.pt|would have supported me through this i literally don't i think she's actually
mels/024473.pt|pretty perfume ad in the first seven seconds and then by the end of it it's not like we're like thinking
mels/028404.pt|we're in a big zoom call meeting or
mels/016869.pt|and scariest things it has potential to be like a complete unlock of resources for humanity to enjoy a golden age of prosperity and has a potential to be a
mels/030471.pt|we're on the beach that part is
mels/015245.pt|game of thrones yeah the the terrible
mels/028280.pt|so that's my that's the only
mels/022628.pt|if you're going to be angry enough and remember i didn't even stream at the
mels/001789.pt|got a smoothie in one hand
mels/023573.pt|i think about it my final example is when you go too far with that is
mels/010671.pt|practicing the new maps playing with whoever maybe maybe
mels/018001.pt|well that's one solution we could kill everyone everyone right now i feel like to stop people
mels/000735.pt|at that point it's almost a
mels/030857.pt|in going yeah i mean i feel like there'd be talk about salary
mels/024457.pt|at the time so they're like doubling down and spending a ton of money on a huge new ad campaign to try and
mels/027435.pt|and nobody nobody saw it so i'm glad i see the
mels/001919.pt|it's to walk away with that
mels/001490.pt|if only i could know the answer to do
mels/009821.pt|it's an electric yeah electric sales
mels/021415.pt|wait right here when volkswagen hit the peak of the squeeze it was the most valuable company on planet earth for a moment but the problem was now it was regular guys a lot of them against a lot of millionaires too by the way the average
mels/008860.pt|i have the greatest year of their lives this is
mels/032160.pt|why money if a 12 comes up so those
mels/022380.pt|it's probably less scary to jump from this height than lower if you're this far up it just
mels/022940.pt|i don't think i mentioned this before
mels/013780.pt|hey what do you do when your name your brand name is
mels/010566.pt|impression that you were the best man to my wedding and there was nothing that you thought
mels/010931.pt|i think oh yeah one free year of
mels/021344.pt|and you enjoyed it perhaps consider
mels/026888.pt|avocado they are banned from the
mels/025698.pt|and the movie downloading system in the world
mels/026837.pt|the seconds for 7 million dollars so you
mels/026077.pt|and remember doing a game show with me and if you know there is
mels/009090.pt|so many fun songs like so many fun songs and you guys are going to hear them i don't care how long it takes me to find them i want you guys to hear the fun songs
mels/012387.pt|well so far ahead of me and ari he was like way he was
mels/022841.pt|it's deal was done with stock what that means is they bought time
mels/028009.pt|with our games on pc to make a profit this competition is awesome the second one of
mels/025410.pt|we are pausing peter here real
mels/003462.pt|not part of china and so it could lead to military conflict
mels/000893.pt|what i'm talking about that's the
mels/026714.pt|with the million dollars if he leaves activision business blizzard following a change of
mels/005803.pt|it seems like you don't care at all about the
mels/004612.pt|so that'll be in about two hours okay
mels/027884.pt|well forest it's like a controlled demolition
mels/026464.pt|hope you learned a little thing or two about way to think about marketing through the clock model and that was that was a
mels/018194.pt|one of the brands you can choose from as a
mels/006257.pt|of the greatest gaming moments in history where one man his chimp and a series of darts shot
mels/029307.pt|of universal studios and this is like early riot this is like
mels/003437.pt|i mean it's party representatives i believe it
mels/024361.pt|you're in there somewhere there's not
mels/023189.pt|but if they add even like a drop of fruit juice they can call it made with real fruit there's nothing healthy about it another one is
mels/008541.pt|unravel everything which means to do that that means twitter goes back to how
mels/022900.pt|job somewhere else that is the crux of the argument okay and so obviously to counteract that epic
mels/002694.pt|we're going to roll it one more time we will never walk away
mels/023354.pt|sustained public pressure and a leak during the epic games trial that
mels/018625.pt|this is crazy and they said next year we're
mels/020031.pt|why google for 50 million dollars which is
mels/031328.pt|have to take me away from the group and put me in a cop car and take me
mels/022230.pt|no i don't want any johnny walker it's
mels/011695.pt|if the racks i might as well try to have a good
mels/005520.pt|it was tough for me but i i did it
mels/017332.pt|with 'em to have to uh match
mels/030270.pt|by the way my hair looks amazing i pulled the bottle out and it wasn't
mels/024270.pt|this is an iconic role and now you're just like doing do you take the red key or the blue key for great luxury
mels/020580.pt|i pray for that guy damn it man i just bought this game on pc today i want you to know that i like this game
mels/031471.pt|with any way it was a fantastic weekend i only
mels/025345.pt|well i got this guy i stole this from the set
mels/004776.pt|with the value so far this year you can see the drop in april to now and so all of those loans started to be less secure
mels/021504.pt|because they have to get it down or they're losing billions and losing billions is people will kill for that i mean they'll do anything what does it mean people
mels/009686.pt|keep it up keep it up
mels/016799.pt|is that target these new global uh
mels/020306.pt|it's targeting parents now they had to pay to put this in the
mels/006625.pt|if the ticket pulling the trigger and buying
mels/025549.pt|they should have an effective way to leverage it
mels/014128.pt|ninja and the numbers didn't go up
mels/021590.pt|diamond hands to explain it is the idea that once people start selling it creates a
mels/016281.pt|i can trust with that it is almost certainly c d project oh oh they did the exact same thing for
mels/014900.pt|and the nintendo's lawsuits have felt at least thematically appropriate
mels/019452.pt|but i see a wheaties ad and then later
mels/022496.pt|i'm going to start with the company
mels/004489.pt|it's funny people like him but
mels/029189.pt|i wouldn't call them riots i would call them peaceful
mels/017859.pt|in the beautiful game that's so fun and then you buy it and the
mels/001479.pt|only going to have chat open nobody is on
mels/026030.pt|in america works for amazon that's just a new piece of information that hit me
mels/019523.pt|the thing where would you put
mels/027816.pt|i know they're asking this because i can look at the data people are asking
mels/001968.pt|well joke but i think literally like if if um
mels/029025.pt|like i've told it since i was like
mels/020001.pt|if think on my list it was done in 1984
mels/022459.pt|we are like all timers that i think of all
mels/026669.pt|okay before the first season of overwatch league launched he came to twitch bobby kodek and the blizzard team
mels/005792.pt|by the way the video was doing well the video was doing well had a great
mels/024663.pt|access to debt the reason everything is so high right now including me
mels/003905.pt|if you have to run you can still run you can lose the democratic primary and run as an independent but in america that means you can't win who would be a good candidate
mels/022549.pt|when it came out wait how did you think it was an ad pokemon go no you didn't think
mels/030465.pt|and they didn't so i didn't even look at
mels/009334.pt|think size two servings per container so that means that i get to have
mels/009801.pt|yo chemicals and glass in germany could
mels/026337.pt|is the steve jobs quote you design a ritual of unpacking to make the product feel special packaging can be theater it can
mels/023825.pt|but i'll give it a shot
mels/012705.pt|like league of legends is a game that makes you angry
mels/020358.pt|oh this one this is actually on my list
mels/006744.pt|extra my grandmother from my grandmother
mels/017164.pt|some pretty we got a good deal on the next run
mels/025391.pt|way too expensive so now i'm
mels/000914.pt|i don't mean it i don't mean it but if you
mels/019545.pt|yeah that's all i can do
mels/028460.pt|but looking at him now he was like a kid
mels/005343.pt|sitting down everyone's filing in getting to
mels/024807.pt|one lol skins and that's the big
mels/002692.pt|love that for you and you know what though there is no penalty you could just walk away just just checking you don't feel like walking away do you
mels/028486.pt|we crying okay and he's like
mels/031211.pt|this reminds me of atlanta and so i must tell it this is the story of how i became a felon none of you are allowed to repeat this it's a no
mels/020921.pt|i think passions change passions are very whimsical i was extremely passionate about starcraft and league of legends professional play and if i told myself this is what i have to do this is my dream if i because literally at one point i was grinding league 15 hours a day and eventually thanks to
mels/004125.pt|well that's my that's my takeaway
mels/028498.pt|but he gets out of there and then my
mels/016702.pt|the to work but as the rising rents and rising costs for people to live farther and farther from where they work
mels/025461.pt|i got like a token that i could use to spin for a
mels/008432.pt|to take all my previous titles and auto generate with an ai new titles does
mels/003113.pt|i believe it for some reason
mels/015028.pt|if you're busy like me going to the video store is a hassle
mels/028005.pt|it's actually pretty good they do have a decent
mels/017158.pt|if you like me and you love the
mels/008904.pt|well of the memes about that jordan peterson clip all the different edits i want to do it for a video and i will pay you i will pay you i
mels/025339.pt|the through luck and pluck asked to host the pokemon 20th anniversary stream because
mels/013300.pt|iraq can i be your best man no it
mels/015447.pt|going to have the same impact that disney has
mels/002882.pt|we could very well be in a situation where elon musk needs to start tweeting positive things about twitter things that imply that he will go through with the deal so this number goes back up closer
mels/024456.pt|is now starting to close some stores and
mels/032245.pt|notepad and a little pencil and he looks at the screen and he writes down all of the history of
mels/015407.pt|they used to be able to sell you the same thing like four times so i
mels/023418.pt|shame on you absolutely shame on you
mels/018178.pt|so most car commercials are not designed to appeal to a cracked out zoomer fortnite audience put on your boomer hats today the average
mels/025609.pt|we're going to count facebook as meta then
mels/027140.pt|is essentially free to borrow so right about now is when
mels/006855.pt|i go to a gym so no i wouldn't do that that would feel incredibly embarrassing to set up a camera and like what's up coffee calves
mels/027283.pt|by showing you godric the grafted in a
mels/000296.pt|at the to learn he tried to learn for a video and then
mels/031414.pt|here don't worry about that second of all you don't need to ask
mels/002472.pt|why with the brand mission they weren't like
mels/024522.pt|i it looks like apple does have monopoly
mels/012348.pt|like all the food was but i mean listen uh
mels/019863.pt|at the story in the universe was huge
mels/026358.pt|as brand value versus their competitors
mels/005850.pt|what the whole time both of us know that he's seen it
mels/012605.pt|i tell you this the reason i think buying
mels/001806.pt|i think the beginning was the best part he had some good questions
mels/010493.pt|what a firefly another season actually i want
mels/005960.pt|the stage and only one man has the bravery the
mels/006297.pt|i feel like i'm out of the loop act man was uh extremely nice to me
mels/013427.pt|i want to lecture me on the different ways to pronounce five nights at freddy's fandom that's a you problem that is
mels/007968.pt|will be out and then i can actually do more
mels/001212.pt|how would you get started i guess listen um you could find
mels/011708.pt|eventually we got through to her after
mels/018689.pt|knows the difference okay so early on xbox
mels/000588.pt|everyone's incredibly gifted and so right before we go in
mels/025792.pt|but that's blizzard's week let's talk
mels/032324.pt|but it's not the whole community obviously there is just some percentage of people in the
mels/012119.pt|learn okay learn to work together on
mels/022690.pt|a billion dollars and you're not making
mels/021603.pt|i go a little bit bigger for these tom
mels/002876.pt|so their follow-up case could be within a few weeks after that and also only take a few days so
mels/032063.pt|not to the producers nobody knows what he's
mels/009871.pt|you know germany to paris in no time like
mels/024045.pt|their love for the brand they felt
mels/022087.pt|is holidays most specifically as a marketer that loves seeing
mels/014190.pt|i think people have a lot of wrong information about who's actually winning and this is the best way to break it down okay except for
mels/025960.pt|it's negative momentum like this and such bad pr what you end up with is a brain drain this is the biggest threat to accompany a blizzard size and
mels/000840.pt|out of nowhere being like yeah
mels/006858.pt|i just doing that phone stream with um who dat
mels/031556.pt|this happens he does this insane flank he attacks from the top the bottom
mels/013844.pt|this is all all all bad bad bad bad
mels/018241.pt|they might have green screened it
mels/000805.pt|it's like i cannot lose i've already won so much the odds
mels/018610.pt|or consoles if they make this exclusive people will buy xbox for it and so why wouldn't they yeah now
mels/022533.pt|smart googlers are how much different the google
mels/029313.pt|i want to work in esports but i had just
mels/016883.pt|people places like twitch are seeing massive growth and so people that are creators for the digital economy
mels/000760.pt|so i had a video idea
mels/010262.pt|if the people who can be on my fall guys team because two people are not available one of them
mels/023513.pt|i guess what the average age of a ferrari
mels/016824.pt|and it's seeing a lot of money and tailwinds
mels/023270.pt|and i labeled them and i tested it with
mels/011872.pt|it it actually feeds back into what's going on the ship so what i realized is that pretty quickly i realized this is that
mels/025161.pt|it's all they had to do i graduated college this is
mels/030046.pt|try and distract me so this is kind of more of a psychological breaking test for me interesting sure yeah like that one
mels/018375.pt|me good job only fans dude
mels/029623.pt|climax the climax what i can gather the
mels/016015.pt|in the first two weeks so you have to yeah that's
mels/023403.pt|i think there was a funny quote where the guy's
mels/009555.pt|well he still could big yasuo
mels/029080.pt|of like spending all my day on
mels/028293.pt|openly call out the ceo in front of the entire company week after week so it would be like
mels/018815.pt|the hot ones Youth color attractive and he's
mels/021621.pt|i promise i will not eat any more of your friends really
mels/021970.pt|or and proudly proclaimed at two minutes per
mels/005304.pt|was it was it was wild and so big ass line was a little bit awkward because i have
mels/026009.pt|was defraud let's get back to the wins though
mels/016150.pt|i think the problem strange one day
mels/015241.pt|okay this black line right here is is
mels/019216.pt|no and my jaw hit the floor as a kid I mean
mels/027580.pt|to realize this company is already overvalued
mels/030387.pt|if the thing is going through the bags going through and it beeps or
mels/025656.pt|seeing crypto scams punish crypto bros live is like my favorite
mels/024077.pt|and each one of those kitchens delivers food
mels/002701.pt|maybe you want to leave right now and go play it you don't really need to stick around do you
mels/017202.pt|it's not as severe i've heard like hospitalization but it's like it's just it it sucks like the worst flu you ever had
mels/021667.pt|and of course people aren't like oh my god i
mels/002562.pt|you know how the game goes
mels/015081.pt|people still use dvd rentals dvd rentals were still
mels/019945.pt|that's five billion dollars and to put that into scale
mels/027524.pt|into it and i wanted to see
mels/017735.pt|or packaging this focus has what led them
mels/020486.pt|they also made the witcher adventure board game
mels/011227.pt|she asked me what he asked me what i think pog is that's ridiculous
mels/023796.pt|like it's all about making hyper relevant content that people would find funny for yeah
mels/030900.pt|she had more than one cup of pooty and
mels/022159.pt|up the emotion consistently so we're in for a hell of a run of sad ads today now
mels/018935.pt|any kind of knowledge about what
mels/014098.pt|let me go full screen i don't leak like a youtube contract or evacuate the and that is let me go full screen so i don't leak like a youtube contract
mels/018049.pt|this is how japan sees america
mels/027903.pt|overvalued everything every asset has been in the past two years it's been hard to find a great deal nobody can get a good house at a good price anymore but thankfully i've found one and who can jump on this quickly hopefully
mels/003058.pt|we would i was just you know what
mels/009598.pt|even though it's a beautiful esport and i love the international nobody
mels/007842.pt|put that clip in yeah you might be had for some for put that clip in yeah you might be headed for some for some ds
mels/014603.pt|dope streaming platform if you want to get if you have a good internet speed but but
mels/000043.pt|part of the and then they're gonna when
mels/008806.pt|check out just pay a billion dollars that's what i thought it's not it's not that
mels/008983.pt|like a prime bonus on prime day i feel like everyone should get a second prime on prime day or something there should be some sort of prime oh there is
mels/019728.pt|there are certain things you can do but first of all asking
mels/018026.pt|we've beaten in two hours so i'm
mels/016215.pt|there's no information that i can
mels/013854.pt|taking my business elsewhere you're always lying you're always lying everyone knows
mels/021117.pt|know what maybe maybe you guys would laugh more if i was like i i
mels/016187.pt|pretty monday and i like that as opposed to the rest of them which are never interesting
mels/002410.pt|thank you for the tier one i think one of the most inconvenient parts about
mels/031940.pt|a little bit angry at what's going on and they make a stick and they start
mels/018385.pt|to know what they're paying for in one that's better tagline that's a better tagline than i've heard from a lot of
mels/030026.pt|it's been having a tough time he says he says to me
mels/030101.pt|or eat that food or you could talk to it and so again this
mels/011847.pt|it's like it's it's it's a small room now the
mels/008481.pt|is everyone said come to brazil and then i
mels/019881.pt|not just bad games but like over like it's these are it's funny it's like the perfect storm is a publisher with a huge marketing budget and a mediocre to bad game number three number three anyway this is my number one but it's number three on my list okay
mels/014233.pt|we starting on twitch and being homegrown and then
mels/006327.pt|that doesn't seem like a good idea it doesn't seem like a smart that seems like i'm throwing myself to get involved in a bad way that doesn't help anyone and makes it worse for me two wrongs
mels/022714.pt|of the money for bad phones and this is the ceo
mels/030921.pt|probably true probably probably the main
mels/018540.pt|all the ad stuff amazon is trying to
mels/009304.pt|yeah essentially it should be legislated kind of like gambling because it is gambling it activates the same part of your brain as gambling except they can do
mels/024051.pt|search interest for only fans to reach an
mels/029595.pt|like all of the top players have gotten a lot better at handling
mels/017161.pt|the factory goofed and gave everyone
mels/013361.pt|in this hypothetical example this is actually a chug jug you've called me out on it and i'm mad because
mels/017194.pt|i was like this is just the worst this is like not what i wanted from
mels/006946.pt|the world is my oyster but when you turn
mels/023148.pt|author entrepreneur crypto investor and relatable
mels/002506.pt|add quest it's a really fun side quest
mels/011087.pt|nah that's not true but it's funny that you think that
mels/031627.pt|and this guy moon this guy got second place this guy lost to huck and he was just sitting there on the edge of the bed sad just drinking sadly because he was the first person
mels/019140.pt|but then I realized none of that
mels/016512.pt|i like a shirtless jeff bezos on his yacht in
mels/017720.pt|you couldn't tell they were new and that's why i think every new iphone from now on will have something done with the camera
mels/030684.pt|you barely you didn't have as much time to to think about it you know
mels/010985.pt|actually right now my parents have it
mels/030082.pt|what am i gonna do when i
mels/028435.pt|if i just started rapping i would have been yellow wolf exactly
mels/009810.pt|well like everyone's going through it
mels/026851.pt|by the seashore but her seashells didn't sell so well so sally set up a seashell store on squarespace
mels/001925.pt|so why would i you know what i'm saying just because i like streaming i also
mels/031225.pt|so nationals all of the best
mels/008933.pt|in reading the documents and then also looking at what legal experts are saying people who i trust
mels/026535.pt|what there's a there's dozens of these i don't know if we're in like those this weird later stage
mels/006550.pt|move past it that being said they currently aren't so i
mels/002613.pt|what should walk away with my cash destroy i need
mels/024619.pt|in this space more to find a new way to grow revenue and that is digital goods so they're crossing over with the biggest
mels/004957.pt|down about half since then and it's the main reason
mels/025934.pt|they cancel it they give no warning they ruin the esports scene riot has continued to support
mels/025158.pt|we can bring it back now i promise you we're
mels/001612.pt|if you have a video please go to the discord and drop it in the get smarter
mels/013280.pt|i don't believe in you guys it would just be me yelling at you guys
mels/030927.pt|and one ball is bot one
mels/019678.pt|but it's there so if they
mels/001282.pt|it's extra weird because at the same
mels/001071.pt|like sure we get zenzo and
mels/010745.pt|dies in a tragic fire left behind by this clip
mels/019162.pt|i didn't like it was kids at the beginning all playing games on different
mels/027025.pt|if the more american than that chills literal chills
mels/012829.pt|at the time he was the head of
mels/017744.pt|they have a better purchase experience which makes their brand stronger post purchase they have uh frequent updates
mels/026633.pt|over half the value of sony as
mels/024093.pt|two seconds ago and a pedestrian
mels/005635.pt|with miz was exactly like that so that's
mels/011100.pt|not that you've ever had a real friend but like imagine you did okay
mels/004999.pt|i of the story and they basically say that even though you waive due diligence
mels/003230.pt|which is a new version of the game that doesn't involve crypto at all
mels/020622.pt|to respond to coronavirus i'm so
mels/005419.pt|really has a mind for it he understands
mels/013317.pt|you as a collective maybe as individuals let me find one individual
mels/001453.pt|in the line if you could answer
mels/017116.pt|jeff jeff freak show xf stingy evil slake
mels/015444.pt|pixar movies they're just they're just bigger they have a better bench they
mels/010083.pt|in up the mess after cooking uh
mels/021773.pt|trailer as a horror film because what
mels/006741.pt|they don't i'm in meetings with all
mels/022816.pt|actually made was worth this much and time warner which made about
mels/019202.pt|because it was like the little kids one like the
mels/020545.pt|beginning to die down the overall takeaway narrative is like the game was buggy and even if it gets fixed and they add
mels/028722.pt|it's like real journalist it's like wall
mels/019603.pt|they sound like me talking to my
mels/022973.pt|even come close turning a profit it's
mels/029990.pt|we're right i mean you're not i'm
mels/029169.pt|undeterred the planners decided to go
mels/017588.pt|lose your money when you buy the car you buy the car it's
mels/010297.pt|in ross i will of course ask him do you think i'm
mels/006640.pt|oh my god dude they took chris paul
mels/015177.pt|paramount they're all bidding the same content in hollywood okay
mels/011763.pt|but i don't say that because i'm playing along
mels/008201.pt|it is said we'll give you 40 million
mels/010379.pt|let's find out donkey's video the looker
mels/023397.pt|do you think ford will ever collab with epic games to make
mels/002400.pt|watch during prime grind time what do you mean
mels/031263.pt|at the counter like like i'm an employee i'm just at the counter of an orange julius with my laptop out
mels/020116.pt|we're going to watch interesting videos that's the idea
mels/008606.pt|will defeat the spam bots or die trying and then his bid succeeds
mels/014814.pt|in all their games so like you can buy ghost recon let's see
mels/002660.pt|he was a french naturalist biologist academic and a proponent of evolution and then
mels/032067.pt|at the time so that nobody pulled
mels/010449.pt|in some ways we all were
mels/025876.pt|went off over and over and over and over when you mess up they will flip on
mels/009355.pt|yeah i remember that guy it's crazy as
mels/005831.pt|the morals and being a good friend it was tough
mels/027251.pt|it was an ubisoft game you would have paid
mels/021830.pt|the quite a good writer especially the first half of this book is all letters to shareholders they basically found every later he ever sent to amazon shareholders where he was convincing them to give him the quite a good writer especially the first half of this book is all letters to shareholders they basically found every letter he ever sent to amazon shareholders where he was
mels/013126.pt|i don't think xbox game pass
mels/017379.pt|spider-man alone was by far the most successful movie of
mels/028972.pt|because they were living in germany
mels/013951.pt|one thing that's there's one thing that's
mels/012686.pt|we're going to have your life ruined when the riot mmo
mels/027282.pt|it's been part of their ethos dark souls has been shorthand in the gaming community for difficulty for years now people call things the dark souls of x and so what i want to do is compare that across in the marketing world and to do that
mels/016208.pt|see beer cat thank you for the prime
mels/030609.pt|everyone hitting up google have some
mels/031809.pt|i being right here in ludwig's orbit to being pretty much in ludwig's orbit but also more in charlie's orbit i'm pretty much
mels/016550.pt|it used to cost a hundred million
mels/028921.pt|no one no no and she was laughing about it she's the one that told me this story no different girl different girl she was
mels/016662.pt|more and more important every year people that know a lot
mels/023465.pt|seven or eight thousand cars that's it in the whole year and you'd think wow one
mels/008661.pt|it's unlikely i think it's unlikely um
mels/026207.pt|and it's it's not the world's greatest experiment experience and for sound so we hooked that up to
mels/006326.pt|fuck someone who i'm getting mad at for
mels/023595.pt|wasted just as much money on pr consultants after the spill as they lost in the spill they've tried so many things to
mels/028698.pt|i drive up and down california going to everything so i
mels/003827.pt|it it be the biggest party i'm just saying uh
mels/003636.pt|and they are dying like you know like
mels/005230.pt|and it feels like you know when i get
mels/028832.pt|at one point i don't know if i told this
mels/010081.pt|it easy i think if you're
mels/006294.pt|stream idea let your dad cut your hair that's a terrible
mels/027954.pt|a perfect man vin diesel he claimed that diesel always shows up late to the set doesn't know his lines and he shows up out of shape what about family justin lin and what's crazy is if you look more into this
mels/003204.pt|at the poverty i read an interesting story i'm
mels/003207.pt|in the philippines it's kind of the biggest example of pay to earn type crypto gameplay
mels/030546.pt|work parking garage you open up a door you're in a sealed underground room full of bikes there's bike racks and an air

mels/006474.pt|in the promise y'all we are in a recession
mels/026780.pt|a high stock value generally makes it easier to raise money to take on debt at favorable terms and the momentum having a rising stock price also attracts talent for cheaper
mels/018220.pt|but he's also the cheapest of the of that cast and it makes perfect sense they would hire him and save money
mels/014264.pt|at us we're actually launching the facebook
mels/008647.pt|what if he doesn't pay now that's interesting i love that question that's the real question so i don't think the question is whether or not the court's going to side with

mels/024956.pt|very susceptible to algorithms and corporations that have designed these
mels/029791.pt|because whenever i first met you
mels/024057.pt|we'll see if they can solve that what's the solution i mean listen they're printing money hand over fist they are making an absolutely insane
mels/027115.pt|it's one of the biggest causes of a societal unrest because any savings that the
mels/003910.pt|chance of winning that might run
mels/009277.pt|why are the bosses so short it's crazy
mels/005322.pt|is right and so uh but it was really funny because i was
mels/000989.pt|it's your birthday dude everyone seems
mels/031707.pt|makes me feel like i really don't need to worry about whatever s3k is
mels/026264.pt|and in fact they have consistently rated the best brand in the world the
mels/021286.pt|of duty it works for valor it
mels/023636.pt|emergencies agencies like ice it just feels so inauthentic and
mels/003856.pt|that was coming from whoever was president
mels/029472.pt|just a terrible way to spend your time then the next day that boss
mels/007176.pt|it it's doing things that no
mels/008497.pt|and i found the funny parts
mels/012911.pt|good marketer and i felt like blizzard would be like a
mels/016011.pt|if that you can do it they're not going to
mels/028621.pt|and he thought i wouldn't get it
mels/007493.pt|i don't know what i don't know
mels/010578.pt|the come back in instantly he's like at the door
mels/023519.pt|once they get this number up they do not raise price and if you have a big
mels/025612.pt|nvidia alphabet amazon mana and it's gonna work perfectly when the rock becomes our president it's all connected and
mels/015217.pt|this is why i think they're one
mels/030031.pt|if you don't have it anymore
mels/004961.pt|and i'm very glad that i sold when i did
mels/008528.pt|fuck now only if you think if you are the person out there who is certain if you're the judge if you're the delaware court judge and
mels/029722.pt|it before other people yeah he was like wait a minute i've been a competitor
mels/029543.pt|get there we're sitting in the front row
mels/006841.pt|but it was uh it was
mels/012111.pt|so i'm getting frustrated with darth earl
mels/026411.pt|it the better dealerships car dealerships in general are a bad experience tesla
mels/027277.pt|it'd be elden ring which has sort of branched
mels/027350.pt|it is sort of a good way to um think
mels/012426.pt|wait first of all here's the
mels/028966.pt|if the feed myself and i can't
mels/026652.pt|is that i want to tell you about that i'm pretty excited about here's an app review where it gets a 9 out of
mels/012091.pt|it's like i know the fellow impossible i
mels/003775.pt|have called joe manchin twice now and it's
mels/016968.pt|or i could play elden ring
mels/002237.pt|it's advertising a big deal we don't do
mels/027922.pt|every nft collection taking a beating
mels/002500.pt|walking around cities and there's these dueling competing coffee shops
mels/024180.pt|million plus at me then i would never do that okay
mels/032004.pt|like literally like scar was like i'm going to order this pancakes and orange juice and his
mels/013395.pt|and then if i tell you the truth which
mels/031485.pt|in playing starcraft seriously for 22
mels/008130.pt|so supportive of both the stream and the
mels/024524.pt|in the ruling with almost all of the things epic was pointing out success is not a
mels/008619.pt|think more realistically they're going to make
mels/009458.pt|i've been in a lot of
mels/009667.pt|the one next lcs yeah next year
mels/031117.pt|and me having done it when i was seven was such an advantage that i took a break in the middle got uber eats stopped
mels/007227.pt|he wants to get sponsored he's
mels/021225.pt|peacock premium which is every episode of the office and peacock premium plus
mels/011434.pt|it's it's it's it's i'm actually going to
mels/011832.pt|i mean that was like gonna fit in
mels/007135.pt|or mask and the guy's next to me
mels/015661.pt|the biggest upset the the biggest chances to do super well netflix and amazon prime the biggest upset the biggest the biggest chances to do super well
mels/027276.pt|it's what allowed them to really stand out from the pack for
mels/005564.pt|we kept driving and apparently smashed the window
mels/023925.pt|his talk about the way quackity
mels/024830.pt|you should be able to spend your money over and over and over again on a variety of
mels/006596.pt|saw it through osmosis nobody paid so they the meme did something for the viewership of the movie but i don't
mels/011801.pt|is what i'll say let me give you the first plus i'm gonna give you the honest pluses and minuses the first plus was that the interior
mels/009264.pt|i think always great i just thought it felt like
mels/008970.pt|i made a bunch of them and all of them seem to
mels/010740.pt|all the oh no it's off again oh
mels/028073.pt|the only reason that apple got into the iphone
mels/030301.pt|i've already put out the invite
mels/020041.pt|and for acquiring doubleclick for a mere
mels/022959.pt|rocket league plus battle breakers plus other games okay all the way up here at
mels/031916.pt|well private room almost like like a square
mels/015585.pt|if they they raised about two billion dollars to make
mels/006578.pt|for pennies they got the last
mels/020500.pt|it over the ceo of spotify literally
mels/026457.pt|big part of his brand and it makes you feel proud to support him financially
mels/031067.pt|a signing bonus i had money but he was
mels/011838.pt|many people are moving everyone's talking to
mels/000541.pt|is the craziest thing this was i mean
mels/006041.pt|you he abuses australian privilege i will say that and i've i've never said this before because australians have wide
mels/025998.pt|it's today unfortunately our justice system found elizabeth holmes guilty if you can't drop out of stanford at age
mels/018492.pt|i always have one powerpoint that's
mels/000939.pt|despite the fact that you've never participated
mels/025636.pt|and just eat all your meals there every day lunch and dinner every day for years he paid off all
mels/004550.pt|wait over there dude wait for your turn
mels/005274.pt|it's friends start loudly talking about like
mels/022997.pt|you have to do no work apple does barely any work and they get an insane amount of money
mels/020475.pt|you can get good graphics and a good game on a console and when you buy into the hype over
mels/013351.pt|how do you talk to people in real life that's insane you see a water bottle
mels/016505.pt|i have hours understanding it now none of us myself included
mels/026456.pt|stop competing he would actually see a significant drop off in subs even though his stream would not change in quality the
mels/004256.pt|like crazy stuff happening in china but because uh people want to
mels/023359.pt|all of us gamers until one side pulls ahead and then it's
mels/028419.pt|he became a colonel and a commander and uh he
mels/002776.pt|to figure it out live so we're
mels/019273.pt|but then they fired back with this the Xbox flop of the
mels/016220.pt|did you already do the guessing
mels/008916.pt|wanna talk if you have something you have to like if i owe you money for something or whatever go through pay he's going to handle that and i'm um i'm
mels/027876.pt|at reasonable levels as real investments like a more
mels/026439.pt|from mango you get an immediate visual and audio queue reward you get your sub
mels/021587.pt|it was and so they're freaking out as i would be if i owed somebody all these carrots why don't you believe in diamond hands because of human psychology and because
mels/030690.pt|the prize yet it's in my parents
mels/014361.pt|what i'm saying there's a there's there's things in other countries that have really built this out china's very
mels/002090.pt|we're excited for it no what are you asking
mels/010218.pt|i like the the new one no no no the old one and
mels/030143.pt|in the world from the guys that made the witcher i have to have it pre-order do you guys remember that when i said i might not do anything but cyberpunk for two
mels/017281.pt|it's the day where classic works entered
mels/024190.pt|in the fails i think that was the main ones i'm
mels/008448.pt|take a different tactic yeah sigma outside the system exactly i was the goalie in soccer and i would face the goal
mels/018118.pt|you are witnessing greatness you can
mels/022895.pt|winning this argument and they didn't like throw in a bunch of funny jokes anyway so apple opened with a steve jobs quote and that is a hard quote to beat we're trying to
mels/027294.pt|it's a rite of passage in a way
mels/031161.pt|worry about yourself why are you worried about him he's making a million dollars and he's getting
mels/015512.pt|this guy do you remember this guy this is apple tv
mels/020577.pt|that's poignant and wise all they need
mels/031169.pt|it help but like abuse people that just have a warped sense of what's going on bro
mels/013338.pt|one package of every kind of oreo you know the double stuff the triple
mels/001273.pt|look at all these game posters
mels/012094.pt|i guy would look at me
mels/020945.pt|it's like if you're like i'm going to start an instagram for my dog
mels/029220.pt|i you do it whatever you need brother i'm
mels/002201.pt|i i write it off of my taxes it's
mels/020883.pt|is stress and by the way having a job that offers you the money to do things you enjoy it's not a bad thing
mels/014006.pt|these are almost sold out if you would like the dope nickname
mels/003673.pt|but then because the wealth is generational and doesn't reset and doesn't there's not
mels/018849.pt|think that word out of our cab
mels/024739.pt|why business might be interested in this kind of model
mels/015976.pt|and so we have to understand is that the strategy for all
mels/013755.pt|read pillar of gaming community and then in the past few years have completely trashed their entire reputation image and future while riot is on an
mels/022486.pt|today's topic on marketing monday april fool's that's right
mels/008478.pt|okay well that's you understand that that's probably a rude thing to say inappropriate
mels/027222.pt|hold a screenshot of horizon zero dawns
mels/014030.pt|and is now streaming exclusively on youtube gaming and that means the war has just begun because ludwig is not
mels/024347.pt|i that you could have got across by the way an insurance company like in the height of
mels/016889.pt|what i'm saying if you have a
mels/027288.pt|what are the benefits for for the for the community
mels/005563.pt|stay in the stay in the vehicle and so we
mels/011796.pt|taking off right and then you
mels/000329.pt|actually moving up but like in the game you stand in a square and it feels like you're moving up
mels/032397.pt|for the look at look at
mels/010467.pt|like most people on twitter who suddenly are against it
mels/032292.pt|if voice sounds just a teensy bit gone
mels/028361.pt|office lingo that i have long resisted and now succumbed to
mels/006958.pt|add playing in the backyard you know you just
mels/010037.pt|i got a bunch of fun auditions and really cool stuff coming
mels/009440.pt|have actually fight in that fight
mels/022096.pt|we had a pretty large group he wrote i only tip god
mels/031458.pt|a team of private chefs waiting a team of private chefs waiting
mels/030200.pt|that while he was doing that he pissed himself he said the exertion made him
mels/025395.pt|which is actually kind of gangster and so now i'm back on board as a
mels/023855.pt|released a new coke replacing the classic coke formula and the outcry was immense everyone was angry and terrified and mad
mels/010275.pt|pulled it down and then crawled inside
mels/025275.pt|with the pressure and then i found out that squid game is not like those other shows stranger things queen's gambit bird box
mels/029415.pt|i couldn't even focus on the conversation please work please work please work
mels/024518.pt|of those got struck down unfortunately the main claim that the judge made i read
mels/024815.pt|well i'd like to show you called let's go whaling tricks for
mels/025021.pt|the iron curtain of ubisoft is hated across all of europe and i think that's pretty pretty accurate
mels/000597.pt|cause i'm sure it was great thank god like not not very like only 10 minutes
mels/014272.pt|things are heating up again and i think so i put this in question marks for
mels/023492.pt|and it worked it did whoever came up with truck
mels/005005.pt|the both sides vetting it there's no real way to get around it he
mels/020828.pt|and talk about marketing or tuesday and uh some people said it
mels/008539.pt|so it you know what i think is more
mels/025955.pt|they don't make a quick buck for them has led to this in this past week and that is a complete total collapse of blizzard stock market price
mels/003104.pt|let's go sorry youtube streamers yuck you don't work for the number one company
mels/030637.pt|in the whole house and the night before i was like flipping
mels/031032.pt|and she just had bad allergies or she's sick
mels/022387.pt|what the earth being round i
mels/005506.pt|really really yeah it was actually the people that are um that
mels/000944.pt|people that are going actually because i didn't plan it
mels/024958.pt|on the rise and scariness of gotcha
mels/014240.pt|given it a shot and you've tried to learn from him
mels/003620.pt|we don't have a good relationship
mels/009654.pt|what if we did this what if we do this this will attack from the east and all the generals
mels/008837.pt|well like you'd have to pay or
mels/015538.pt|market share only in the united states but apple tv doesn't operate globally as well as other other competitors so peacock has a slightly bigger
mels/032359.pt|much into this there's like nine paragraphs
mels/021249.pt|the xbox i could tell you about how even if they're both sold out the ebay
mels/007445.pt|know that was mostly all of
mels/001172.pt|enough sprig so i've tried them all and the
mels/007423.pt|it was trying to act out of that knockout
mels/029044.pt|the spree him the parking lot the area the angle i
mels/009247.pt|oh the little do you know
mels/011251.pt|i think it's a good idea
mels/025274.pt|and so i was like i'm not gonna
mels/032142.pt|walk you through it i'll walk you through it a little bit near midnight i land in vegas and immediately i've got a hankering for gambling the second i land i withdraw
mels/018093.pt|i was distracted by the woman in
mels/009153.pt|this man i'm gonna get in and i buy
mels/015887.pt|so we'd have to it would have to grow
mels/025806.pt|and he said for me blizzard is leagues ha ha
mels/007769.pt|i mean i guess if everyone in the chat takes off their pants in solidarity
mels/011806.pt|well you know the windows are
mels/012522.pt|wants to do you'll never be bored for the full
mels/026066.pt|this is the last 10 years they've gone
mels/019327.pt|i original ladies enron 2 that's your boy and jason and
mels/011499.pt|that's the movie and like that
mels/025765.pt|it can be done so my overall conclusion here is that while scary ads are often ineffective
mels/011652.pt|about this i thought about how the fact that i
mels/001232.pt|that is that is all of my outbound messages to them i say hey can i just get more of the smoothies but i'll
mels/028896.pt|no i i absolutely i vomited to be quite clear um so but apparently the whole night at
mels/023116.pt|but has high fructose corn syrup if it does they're afraid to buy it
mels/020259.pt|generally you're going to find yourself rejected
mels/017983.pt|no no no i'm not it's like the applebee's commercial during the who that
mels/027337.pt|when they beat it but often their
mels/019805.pt|at the end of the day it was like it was
mels/001428.pt|the the question for some money of course
mels/012194.pt|in the brig and she was really
mels/015812.pt|i start buying influencers they'll start buying
mels/005876.pt|it was a good bit it was i was funny
mels/030918.pt|as your mom's the nicest person i'm
mels/011415.pt|saul sick it was so sick
mels/003090.pt|i'm just gonna put this right here okay hey here's a
mels/001951.pt|really good marketing money like a
mels/008052.pt|glad you're caught up bro hey watch out for
mels/031277.pt|now try back then explaining that i'm no i'm watching koreans play video games no i'm here at

mels/017738.pt|example of the clock model again the
mels/022133.pt|worse jobs i had at twitch
mels/001023.pt|at dogs and the first three

mels/021510.pt|the only person who's putting the money in
mels/004595.pt|i said let's do it again so now
mels/028019.pt|the call that the only cause of
mels/024117.pt|because the primary demographic of tv watchers is like
mels/012399.pt|now they warned us they warned us this in the safety briefing that it's not a
mels/016847.pt|and the one that i'm least comfortable
mels/002457.pt|and so they make flawed consumer profiles and they often can do more harm than good because then
mels/028469.pt|my dad's like hey private uh johnson i
mels/001883.pt|it was just fun interesting questions
mels/030909.pt|it's you know i see the sub count on ludwig and i'm wondering
mels/014792.pt|there is a panel below the stream that you can check out we
mels/011630.pt|it's she just knows a lot about things she's
mels/002406.pt|i need a translator i need a csd
mels/011592.pt|kinda wish they just didn't use it and then i saw then i saw a tweet and the tweet was like
mels/000536.pt|four seasons and we ended up losing a ton of money that
mels/019880.pt|so excited like oh my god it's going to be a true turn to form the game i love but of course
mels/020648.pt|i think because all the primes go to him focus please focus cameraman i paid
mels/022846.pt|is unbeatable now they have this great platform they
mels/009980.pt|are you after you after you after you after you after you've seen that scene i mean
mels/021092.pt|the bounty of earth this is the cube of rubik this simple puzzle was
mels/000475.pt|so i sit back up and i'm like i need
mels/024566.pt|and so apple really does not want it to get off the payment system because then they'd have to actually follow
mels/016720.pt|meeting hours per workday during the pandemic uh
mels/017612.pt|schools of thought okay they created
mels/005134.pt|on the menu i think you're thinking of
mels/005200.pt|like i don't care like that that's but it was
mels/013739.pt|in lighter news but also equally a fail
mels/004015.pt|want a good guy check him out
mels/016627.pt|the hottest years ever in history 19 of
mels/023922.pt|where everyone else trying to make it as a
mels/028072.pt|i like that video because it made me think like
mels/026000.pt|and to be steve jobs create a fake blood testing company raise nine billion
mels/031140.pt|he only made three thousand dollars which is a flagrant it's a technical foul it's a red card it's ridic it's ridiculous
mels/000478.pt|i don't know exactly what time they said but it was a long time okay so i say yes get me
mels/023341.pt|is less and less valuable and traditional
mels/027380.pt|so roblox has done the same thing okay
mels/017022.pt|what's going on what's what's the vibes
mels/028479.pt|and they're having a pretty intense conversation
mels/001221.pt|was that to have many many companies would love
mels/016080.pt|and it's run by a company called
mels/006328.pt|i think i do i think i do i think i do i think i do
mels/026641.pt|what industry and they're using that that muscle they get from owning one industry and they're using that that
mels/030644.pt|and they get kicked out so if you get
mels/024467.pt|now the whole concept is they have a regular subway ad that runs before this
mels/000435.pt|we don't we do not miss uh like
mels/017229.pt|golf the new year with some with an ode to eating ass
mels/020880.pt|oh damn okay starting a business is not right for everybody
mels/008023.pt|it's like what it's like before i played skyrim as a kid what i imagine skyrim would be
mels/005280.pt|ask him to i don't care i didn't
mels/007774.pt|if my subscription was a pregnancy by now we could have had triplets no we've already talked about this right
mels/008228.pt|i was not run like he steps down and if he could do that and we could present an alternate viable candidate
mels/024485.pt|it's just two fails in the great war between
mels/001466.pt|american education wins again congrats thank you so much
mels/028528.pt|out twenty thousand dollars dude owed
mels/021616.pt|was the highest in recorded history nearly 6 million
mels/014585.pt|is so dominant that no matter what happens to live let's say for example
mels/016038.pt|in the bills so a lot of cool features
mels/021652.pt|i legends let's do this they reunited him holy
mels/024659.pt|in america massively invested in some of these chinese bonds so they're starting to be
mels/027320.pt|this game so popular and so that's why i want
mels/001345.pt|it's awesome that was smooth smooth as silk
mels/023733.pt|with these number three it's worth mentioning i already have them now so
mels/009739.pt|while be able to support his extra large fingers also feels like a bit of a
mels/011121.pt|can use headphones anymore so i'm going through speakers
mels/007617.pt|can we all transition to an offline
mels/008030.pt|what i'm saying and the problem is it's so
mels/014029.pt|let's talk about the streaming wars today a big announcement my friend ludwig went to youtube okay he took
mels/001114.pt|i met most of my good friends through
mels/026069.pt|was by far the most successful movie of 2021
mels/029063.pt|the come pick me up and you know thank god because i'm not
mels/008746.pt|refer to take over the company which he
mels/010382.pt|this isn't this is an unsolvable puzzle
mels/009843.pt|if the feasible i'll tell you what the best
mels/024322.pt|a lot of sense so i'm gonna have to call this ad mid to
mels/019132.pt|talk about it in a bit and there's not that many games for this launch it's almost
mels/000220.pt|but it was like it was from a cart with a lady that spent like an hour torching it it was like a really fancy one and so everyone else orders one of the exact same
mels/020309.pt|it's a at least a three but nintendo sucks
mels/011639.pt|we're gonna try it out so i booked the tickets
mels/014324.pt|mail shipping company and then when it became a streaming service it didn't make any of its own content you
mels/004036.pt|by the way i i've recorded it so it should
mels/029563.pt|twitch hires two new people for smash
mels/003067.pt|why we're all fine and nobody
mels/024511.pt|that kicked off the entire lawsuit where epic games claimed they had a monopoly they
mels/009769.pt|but it's not about fun so if you have too much fun you'll be banned okay it's
mels/030255.pt|at shower but i go into a shower
mels/010299.pt|yeah it would be awesome to ask northern lion i don't know that if he's available
mels/011523.pt|and that's like that's the reply i was writing like paragraphs
mels/027644.pt|was on twitter's shoulders as a private company and we're looking at something like a two billion dollar yearly interest payment just to pay the debt for elon musk buying the company he is
mels/028964.pt|i've got nothing i literally have no money and no one really to go to like for for for like a week like there's
mels/023931.pt|it's funny like he's smiling this is a huge huge l for other
mels/009263.pt|try to do esports but i think that i love
mels/007679.pt|it's a big win got a
mels/030193.pt|like literally it was like there was no way to make progress
mels/028093.pt|beijing of course intro by premier
mels/009252.pt|with the game for christmas or for the holidays
mels/024216.pt|what the marketing monday and the marketing
mels/022718.pt|but just stayed still for like 10 years
mels/010580.pt|it's fomo it's literally fomo cat is like me for real do you do that because you're a human being so you can
mels/003766.pt|few politicians championed and they were
mels/000211.pt|as that was funny i mean we did
mels/030253.pt|three days i realized i have got to shower oh my god
mels/032172.pt|i say let it ride i don't give
mels/020582.pt|i didn't get into it today because it's
mels/026906.pt|is he knew this would be memeable
mels/015032.pt|netflix all the movies you want
mels/028389.pt|if anyone ever says global or local in my mind i think glocal and i smile i say glocal all the time we
mels/016917.pt|the said that kev dog man bear
mels/011106.pt|that's an interesting theory so you don't believe in any
mels/002492.pt|way more pringles pringles defenders would be
mels/000482.pt|and i sit there and i start to shake
mels/018338.pt|and they are going public at a valuation of like 15 billion or
mels/023841.pt|member of the family i sent him an email
mels/021538.pt|so this is one of the scariest things and i think i can't tell how much of it is real and how much of it is fear-mongering by a well-paid pr machine that is trying to convince people not to invest in gamestop stock but the the worry is that if
mels/010329.pt|organized competitive streamer event when i think of that i think a slime
mels/009255.pt|if the and nine months andre gravy thing for the
mels/002936.pt|but end of the day like i
mels/007096.pt|game of thrones torrents i am so
mels/005358.pt|first i literally don't react i just assume he's talking to someone else so we like he like he's like looks me
mels/025681.pt|if the favorite scary ads of all time and by
mels/030934.pt|job and they saw the security footage
mels/025614.pt|us for let's see what's a fail though to
mels/019959.pt|it's office that captured the imagination of kids everywhere that were selling a ton of merch these movies had cult followings but they didn't do the same and
mels/006349.pt|the past two three weeks of wins and fails starting with a very very very
mels/001814.pt|i was like that it just feels arrogant
mels/026356.pt|the made a conscious effort to really focus on making it
mels/003922.pt|a father son should never be president that's crazy that is craz a father and son
mels/014801.pt|is because people were signing up for it
mels/013776.pt|i do they have harassment abuse
mels/022008.pt|the screenshot if you're like you weigh
mels/015490.pt|not fully committed and it's holding them back
mels/017129.pt|oh thank you finally this hero has saved
mels/013649.pt|complaining i have an important important
mels/006506.pt|way of saying debt and is literally design i mean as a business you know they say things like okay you can split this payment
mels/002688.pt|we're looking for a six though
mels/005240.pt|like all right well i guess we just wait in
mels/032001.pt|this is a true story i didn't think it was weird until he said yes mrs

mels/012316.pt|hear me out it costs five racks so it should be if not more so like the thing is is that i kept thinking like this is pretty cool then i thought
mels/020372.pt|overly reading into it i don't think people are like making something up but there's like a
mels/008181.pt|we just think the minions day
mels/006277.pt|let me eat as much as i can
mels/018486.pt|we're all related to today's topic marketing monday xbox just struck back the revenge bill gates from beyond the grave when he's not busy putting microchips in our vaccines as my aunt told me about on facebook is actually telling the microsoft board to acquire bethesda
mels/018737.pt|it was just better on the inside it was you couldn't tell the difference between that one and the previous one
mels/018286.pt|so much is this let me share it with you
mels/028076.pt|if if the they're like wait a minute if this keeps going people aren't
mels/019558.pt|jingle i might have to follow through oh
mels/002867.pt|the past and the fact that the the judges said you know
mels/020182.pt|it's obviously a good roast but the end of the day you don't ever want the word piss and your brand to even be associated
mels/030901.pt|board games are fun what was that
mels/006447.pt|to try and earn items that i can transfer to other
mels/012574.pt|so i start going through there
mels/010068.pt|i think sponsor i am proud to bring back drum roll please
mels/012942.pt|i just felt like i was disconnected from the real decision making and like so at nvidia i felt way closer to it i
mels/014064.pt|yeah exactly um auto is a rare one and because of
mels/004748.pt|it's okay so he was paying about a six dollar premium per share
mels/004327.pt|money i guess but i don't
mels/017422.pt|big response from girls on a survey was that you know like if they went out and had fun the chances of them getting bullied for it later were pretty high
mels/015640.pt|actually looked into it so to get slightly
mels/027425.pt|well on twitter so it's a win for us who cares if we can't prosecute them we can't charge them
mels/004342.pt|when he just laughs and moves on i'm i'm knocked out how about quincy how about quincy what
mels/023472.pt|it's them you know a certain amount of money to make the car and they

mels/008349.pt|and you get a bunch of cool new stuff and so
mels/012314.pt|well you know like the food was not um
mels/028160.pt|stuff i mean they're spending on the face house
mels/022596.pt|get back to playing the game on your ps4
mels/018575.pt|whoever wins the next generation could win forever it probably it's either the next
mels/018371.pt|good job or a bad job that generally leads to you feeling like miserable in a job okay that's what's one sign of a job that will become miserable if there's a number you can go to your boss and say hey i did this and i did it better than
mels/007993.pt|you guys are like reverse my parents my parents were always like hey listen love this stream but
mels/008754.pt|so they have to take the deal if it's
mels/012253.pt|your some whispering of like oh there's like something happening in this room and whatever and and we're thinking oh that
mels/015176.pt|netflix realized that as they grow and more people show up to be competition all of their competitors disney
mels/026936.pt|wanting nothing like that but uh it it
mels/024817.pt|free to play against the ceo of a mobile
mels/000761.pt|i just tell me if it's terrible or genius while we were walking around this is probably sunday when i was thinking of ways here's how we're
mels/025746.pt|if i plan this whole thing and then the camera goes out right at
mels/010957.pt|the cheese blaster are your nachos looking
mels/000372.pt|with nothing to back it up and like
mels/020787.pt|the most compelling the most on brand story and now we're
mels/024260.pt|such a dated reference by the time they that and you'll never look at luxury the same again

mels/032038.pt|on my script i just wrote dunk a
mels/001236.pt|right i don't think like if you gave the
mels/031855.pt|is still the face of twitch it hasn't changed ludwig did have a month did a
mels/017667.pt|stop spending the extra money on advertising and having a worse packaging might not

mels/021898.pt|two examples that i use in my real life
mels/016365.pt|are dollars that were supposed to rescue

mels/006285.pt|to get rid of poster my dad so if you
mels/008779.pt|like it's everything's out of the window everything's different you know it's just
mels/006591.pt|in nationwide tour at theaters please pull him out make
mels/027058.pt|we're talking about they're just doing unrelated bold things
mels/009639.pt|it losing prospects great back on the package what is stands in the situation is
mels/020016.pt|later where'd the hair come from elon the
mels/009674.pt|i'm not going to play valo no i'm not
mels/023753.pt|or more on car insurance 44
mels/031088.pt|like all right that's dope i bet you will grow but all i said was bro if you
mels/015511.pt|the spoiled rich kid who got really into designing shirts and the shirts all had money bags on
mels/020226.pt|but after its first week the government shut it down citing it as promoting promiscuity booted out they had a tough time deciding where to launch next guys guys let's let the audience decide with another online poll
mels/010370.pt|i don't think she'd explain it though and then
mels/002592.pt|simple question with a simple answer give me head
mels/012566.pt|worried about public and and i use public everyday but i've mentioned this i i sign up for public before i got the worried about public and and i use public every day but i've mentioned this i i signed
mels/007109.pt|where i could start watching game
mels/002352.pt|yeah okay that's not exactly that's not exactly how i describe our relationship i don't and i don't think that me giving you content for free
mels/026092.pt|when i read this article was how much of it seemed to be based off of number one
mels/031083.pt|like all that stuff but he also knew what stuff to
mels/009608.pt|and score and then just walk into their base and be like try to kill me try to kill me so you can cause them to
mels/013818.pt|i've mentioned this on previous marketing mondays but the way this generation of
mels/006151.pt|i did play a little bit of fall guys off
mels/021427.pt|got popular was because there's no commission you can trade as many times
mels/027754.pt|news you've heard not just all week but maybe you're all life the
mels/005990.pt|in people that are such casual watchers and just
mels/029946.pt|we are winning a big turkey
mels/024085.pt|the innovative side of fast food they're trying a lot of new things
mels/021142.pt|a little babies ice cream and nobody knows you you have to break through
mels/020532.pt|i'm worried about what do you see here this is
mels/023820.pt|we in terms of like consistently funny ads best of all time absolutely goated i i really
mels/021380.pt|i give them back to cutie she
mels/012028.pt|it's like okay you have to hold here
mels/025036.pt|it was because it's so bad there i had taco bell in japan and
mels/017313.pt|if they have very high churn which is like people that join and then quit the the fact they added this many new
mels/032278.pt|we'd barely gambled everyone's like yeah yeah
mels/017047.pt|well as that's what they're going to be
mels/008470.pt|what was last night's stream i forget
mels/002276.pt|i would get a lot of earned media it's actually not an insane idea
mels/002438.pt|right that was the big that's the big kahuna everyone always talks about it
mels/024082.pt|do there's four lanes i'm hoping we don't
mels/008278.pt|and that's that we'll talk about
mels/026043.pt|cause of the scale of amazon basically anyone
mels/022594.pt|obviously april fool's joke but just thinking about it feasibly
mels/007233.pt|we thought enron was like a meme he thought it was like
mels/017197.pt|i i'm pretty much fully recovered i i don't think i have any lingering effect i
mels/031273.pt|at the committing a crime obviously and i'm also
mels/028355.pt|and marcus man is furious but he has
mels/019069.pt|dealing with depression in a fake way and then i remembered in the shower today wait a minute i've fallen for this before like this is something i've fallen for and i realized that i love bojack horseman bojack horseman's twitter is entirely in
mels/028213.pt|we talked for real time and he is the most charming flattering person to me he's asking
mels/031519.pt|you have what's called an ace match and that's where you can send out anyone
mels/014584.pt|no that's not that's not what they're doing um and also youtube
mels/029141.pt|and uh pokemon red first came out
mels/005887.pt|the basketball so first he asked who's the best basketball player and they were like
mels/005046.pt|exactly anyway i don't have uh i
mels/027182.pt|in all over the internet and i thought i'd offer a unique perspective on it the question today is why elden ring cannot add
mels/006829.pt|fun you'll have a great time there's a story it's it's actually it's just a really
mels/005265.pt|the second his friends don't know who i am he tries to backtrack like he's already said yo
mels/010954.pt|nothing to do with that so
mels/023320.pt|i swear to god you're being scammed bro
mels/001754.pt|was very very dark so anyway i recommend uh
mels/031436.pt|like every single time it got a little annoying i think to my compatriots so i lob in
mels/031511.pt|in person i i went to korea and was there
mels/000772.pt|each or something and just grab strangers and ask them if
mels/011224.pt|invite him to this game yeah
mels/006028.pt|your trash dude by the way hey
mels/018408.pt|is this ad sucks it's only slightly better than
mels/008465.pt|i mean for keeping your stream going it's another
mels/023290.pt|cristiano ronaldo did not give a single
mels/017011.pt|glad you're feeling better thank you i am i'm feeling actually
mels/019148.pt|maybe he's just got it like that and so maybe it's a right call on Sony's part
mels/001920.pt|walk away with 20 cents that he didn't really
mels/021923.pt|not a lot of people in here and
mels/027333.pt|mad at them for using summons or magic because they need to reduce the amount of people that that qualify as real fans this is an actual psychological need because the scarcity
mels/010405.pt|and then they just print money it's not the free market
mels/028220.pt|we're gonna get good at melee
mels/006191.pt|lady is if you can't afford my rate
mels/017577.pt|where traditional things like advertising has
mels/022580.pt|well a playstation april fool's joke let's
mels/001108.pt|with the club for it uh that's
mels/018970.pt|getting back and forth that creates the the ability to calm your mind that's what zoomers use it for okay
mels/028877.pt|out and shot glasses in a row i realized oh this is this is not going to be fun and so i did the first 11 while everyone was cheering
mels/026471.pt|i thought about nvidia just because i it's my work
mels/031445.pt|we're looking out there we both like start walking towards him because
mels/002441.pt|it's a common phrase if you're talking about who's the big kahuna burger in a game it's the biggest
mels/024862.pt|if you play with your friends a lot for fun you are most likely to buy that new valerie gun skin but what's surprising in my research is that this is not where the money comes from they make money off this to be sure but it turns out that people just buying skins directly is only a small part of the truly large gotcha game economy next up is explorers to make them happy you have to
mels/020067.pt|sure of the internet is not search it's video and if we don't invest
mels/021877.pt|this is also a real photo jeff bezos uses billions of dollars to get a cameo on star trek his favorite
mels/016525.pt|all of this is highly correlated with viewership as viewership goes up
mels/002418.pt|many moons ago you bought the money
mels/023709.pt|he's usually are real these i don't think it's like
mels/001241.pt|i think the xbox tick tock is amazing i think it's like the perfect blend of like
mels/020650.pt|mcdonald's took their first word well
mels/007966.pt|with some you know the hardest part for me it turns out is not really the topics
mels/025865.pt|and that sort of cheap ass attitude that like us us first kind of thing is so backwards looking and
mels/031403.pt|the boat at one point we decided we're
mels/015365.pt|but money isn't everything which is good because hbo max
mels/009183.pt|way more invested in that like i don't
mels/025222.pt|and i want to see some crunch okay
mels/017374.pt|the industry every ticket sold one out of every
mels/005765.pt|i think he's i think he's
mels/030632.pt|weird you know i don't want to be like nerdy or whatever but i do know a good amount so the night before i decide i'm going
mels/004496.pt|hey is there any chance you could wish me a happy birthday it's not my birthday but i'll
mels/000351.pt|ever heard of it let me show
mels/005266.pt|said that but the second like i think there was a girl in his group that
mels/008500.pt|why it was actually quite readable it was long but
mels/024236.pt|maybe the stephen hawking voice was he alive
mels/015660.pt|is he works if they keep executing well if
mels/014596.pt|let's see what we got i'm just
mels/020724.pt|campaign not only did they double their following count on social in one month which is literally unheard of but they increase traffic to their purchase
mels/030211.pt|if the one we were running up and he was just holding
mels/011734.pt|our the blue shirt people who take our bags and again everyone blue shirt and actors they're all in character that this is a space voyage that is the big selling point of this
mels/011472.pt|when your friends do well you don't want
mels/017958.pt|or situation here good to see
mels/009509.pt|it's that was their only chance this is
mels/024296.pt|go to the next one this one's for carlton drought which is a beer brand that i haven't really heard of
mels/013602.pt|i actually had a headache before i went live today and i was like you know what
mels/008633.pt|just papered over them with new cash and twitter is like kind of
mels/024508.pt|where you could use direct payment and get a
mels/024103.pt|we attract another bad boy halo viewing finally you can quit that side thing with nvidia if i get
mels/027117.pt|this is about basically the amount of money that the
mels/029338.pt|it's fine you know i have pleasant small talk with him i'm not like super anxious
mels/013437.pt|how to hold animals the calming art of
mels/013131.pt|the nintendo direct all i saw was strikers uh battle
mels/017802.pt|model that other people maybe not could learn from or replicate to sell more subs
mels/031547.pt|putting their base and you do a bunch of damage he built it he dropped
mels/017037.pt|in general i've had many good experiences with work but on the
mels/031421.pt|are definitely on full display and we're tossing the
mels/004353.pt|i posted it yeah i can't reveal
mels/031986.pt|i'm a full-time twitch streamer now and half of the people here are ultimate players it's crazy these people are so young and they
mels/022743.pt|what a half thinking all right
mels/014437.pt|in the next few years is going to
mels/016413.pt|i don't remember what century exactly it was
mels/023866.pt|in that bowl bowl of strawberries
mels/031420.pt|the beach you know just like surveying the landscape just like perfect form you know just like not even flexing but the guns are
mels/030061.pt|i am a young boy of seven years old i'm seven years old
mels/019611.pt|is undeniable you hate to see it
mels/012070.pt|ari and he knew that she was not good so every time he would see us
mels/018886.pt|these are always fun for me to do
mels/028111.pt|but didn't do the same video i want to talk to you this is both
mels/001778.pt|that's not the issue here i'm saying a
mels/017885.pt|are the most important parts of the clock i think pre-purchase has gotten too much
mels/004162.pt|i'm actually i'm actually crying you made me
mels/002998.pt|and they start prickling up and everyone's
mels/016283.pt|and they had to work overtime for a year and they had the exact same promise last night
mels/025404.pt|we to watch this coke ad i
mels/004591.pt|and then they the contract ran out and they were not renewing and i was still eating factor
mels/003396.pt|he was a cheater yeah he's a cheater
mels/029155.pt|it doesn't work it turns out he had traded me a faulty cartridge with no battery in it you could never save but instead of confronting him i was so obsessed with the game
mels/025434.pt|and is like clapping and crying because
mels/023534.pt|are you would on their car and percentage-wise
mels/007157.pt|no gray area stances on social issues
mels/007224.pt|know he's a little he's just he's
mels/008922.pt|with my one phone call do i get that
mels/009235.pt|could to my ankle yeah it just
mels/007901.pt|and give some what you guys
mels/013227.pt|and what's been bracken dude any
mels/006472.pt|strip clubs are suddenly very empty there's no better indicator that inflation is up incomes are down savings are down
mels/014717.pt|are you just a homeless person on the streets of wall street
mels/003180.pt|it's coming for everybody's lunch really
mels/016689.pt|at looking to create their own car because the future of cars is in some way self-driving and
mels/023543.pt|we're going up a lot recently because they're burning money
mels/009322.pt|and i met a lot of
mels/020049.pt|in my first five months of uploading youtube i'm extremely excited i've had a lot of fun with youtube
mels/002025.pt|with the boba and you saw
mels/012840.pt|even though they'd already booked the sweets and like
mels/001365.pt|if you're not you just don't tell me the truth
mels/008457.pt|impressive of the time out of bounds really
mels/008981.pt|will he get a discount if he buys twitter during prime day twitch you could buy
mels/029516.pt|that helps you because i think i think
mels/025517.pt|through the roof they're actually producing quite a few they're just all getting sold
mels/001542.pt|everyone knows that i just i scrolled down as far as i could on famous paintings he acted like he
mels/001170.pt|terrible business that like had no
mels/013687.pt|he spent three fourths of his time being another ceo for square who owns
mels/024389.pt|we theaters with the movie bridget jones the edge of reason like a pixar intro they put this
mels/003476.pt|here let me get maya and then also
mels/000291.pt|i have any pictures i'm sorry i didn't i you know i wasn't going to be pictured so
mels/028948.pt|yes our yes sir yes sir and we were at the yes sir yes sir yes sir and we were at the top of this hill
mels/025538.pt|everyone's waiting for the other shoe to
mels/030960.pt|and then being upset about it later it's
mels/005433.pt|as i've learned every single thing must be scripted ahead of time
mels/031982.pt|i found out this day that he was unfiltered
mels/028252.pt|while a good scores but there was one thing left to do and that's check references okay now i happen to know some people that work at
mels/005538.pt|but mom and dad a lot oh yeah dude and then also some people there were drunk at the family gathering and they were people in my extended family who weren't invited my wedding
mels/001187.pt|worth checking out the panel's in the link
mels/015627.pt|so if you don't have good originals you can't keep growing the
mels/004743.pt|legally binding agreement to purchase twitter at
mels/004151.pt|this side of it i'm like bro i don't want to do that
mels/004658.pt|ludwig show or whatever i'm just get
mels/019422.pt|there's so many commercials that are
mels/022954.pt|when this was leaked also from the thing epic games in
mels/016597.pt|these guys were not particularly genius okay they're not the the greatest
mels/017795.pt|or and you're spamming it and you're
mels/011645.pt|you can imagine you can get like a
mels/014572.pt|well look here's the thing here's one thing i want to say to everybody about every industry ever you don't want one side to win being a fanboy is the stupidest thing you could ever do if youtube wins this war
mels/018369.pt|but you're helping them so for example quack my editor if he made a good video i am very happy i think i thank him thank you quack your personal contribution helped that is
mels/001647.pt|he's got his cat in a santa hat oh can i
mels/015455.pt|in service to give it to give it uh
mels/026317.pt|if they do so they created these um these
mels/020975.pt|it can't be topped it's so good to see
mels/011701.pt|wait like the whole thing is like it's not
mels/030627.pt|i started reading a lot more because of
mels/001437.pt|i made it so easy a new hope you
mels/009982.pt|what are you talking about it's sitting on the ringer in addition
mels/027293.pt|there are two things one is communal shared experience so it being difficult and being the same for every single person that plays it that means if you and i both beat it you know that we accomplish the same thing there's
mels/032159.pt|that's the long and short of it but there's this bet called the field okay
mels/019377.pt|other teams started trying to to learn
mels/007158.pt|just because then people get you know tuned out to things that i think are bigger
mels/025782.pt|you don't have enough people we can't put this on it's
mels/024196.pt|his money okay twitch loses more money than it makes and so
mels/024919.pt|you've already put time or money into something you
mels/000777.pt|but anyway that was our idea to make
mels/002540.pt|i've never got to use that
mels/009223.pt|by that i mean 14 months
mels/017660.pt|the the packaging they have a secretive
mels/015246.pt|well finale and ending of gain of game of
mels/011417.pt|well there's a lot of players i love
mels/030248.pt|hunched over and played league of
mels/004383.pt|go back and forth because we know we know
mels/018954.pt|with the shows weren't great people watch crap shows all the time
mels/004280.pt|marketing marketing monday on a monday who could believe it who could see it who could achieve it us together let me wait wait wait wait hold on uh
mels/014360.pt|which is a pretty whack experience or let's say you're like a beauty youtuber who
mels/011432.pt|so it's a less busy week like a lot of
mels/027324.pt|is scarcity and as we've talked about
mels/030420.pt|and i'm talking to the receptionist at the hotel francisco he finds
mels/027202.pt|and so because there was this one chance to try things that were
mels/013737.pt|he uploaded a sex game to roblox use slurs yeah yeah so
mels/017560.pt|but in fact the data does not bear that conclusion if you look at the data
mels/012698.pt|and they all get in the
mels/006786.pt|i do want to say one thing though so as
mels/030216.pt|no party he got to the last up is where i peed myself you went down before me i screwed up as
mels/023948.pt|i have one more l you know how
mels/007300.pt|and would win none was like the favorite he was higher seed he's more well known he's beaten music
mels/012081.pt|couple girls eventually join up but it was mostly boys ends up being probably like i
mels/018124.pt|yes i got them the pepsi one second dude that's called clutch
mels/019922.pt|it's just it's not always it's super duper generic but it's also at this point by the time it releases incredibly outdated like shooters have been
mels/031839.pt|in pack openings this past year a billion what is pink
mels/021890.pt|this is a weird segue because the next
mels/022738.pt|in spend a lot of money on phones too
mels/027788.pt|it's disposal really and that is to make it more expensive to borrow money
mels/017443.pt|i never got invited i did
mels/027940.pt|can follow investors if you want to see what
mels/015510.pt|the planet earth so let's talk about apple tv the problem with apple tv do you guys remember that video i did about the
mels/018037.pt|was the man so comfortable with home invasion normally i wouldn't want
mels/001912.pt|one dollar to quack and it's like ugh
mels/028182.pt|but anyway that's my that's my mini deep
mels/030710.pt|if the wrong dude the heaviest building in the world is
mels/003651.pt|means it's very very hard to stop these
mels/017839.pt|this is like the game awards it's like advertising
mels/024773.pt|get rid of that okay the first spend is the hardest and i saw a video by a game developer describing it as like an
mels/005176.pt|i could tell when she started that she actually
mels/003400.pt|oh dude i don't even want to go into it
mels/001392.pt|when i disconnected him does it
mels/000936.pt|it's a chance to win something and i like your moxie and
mels/020983.pt|for this is obviously gen x and boomers and to prove that i actually i did some further digging so
mels/016638.pt|the costs are predicted to be even lower and
mels/005768.pt|well listen i think i handled pretty well i had a good time but yeah that's i
mels/029168.pt|and they ended up purchasing a firestone instead and blew the rest of their money
mels/005165.pt|i think she did a pretty good job especially not knowing anything about the
mels/004509.pt|friends and family are there and i hope you just you never forget it thanks again and happy birthday sincerely
mels/025371.pt|it was on a weekend i was like i kind of
mels/022566.pt|and never ever miss a day of practice again not now
mels/014051.pt|what the youtube and i think it's going to be powerful second thing they got
mels/014161.pt|is it twitch contracts in this period are
mels/012547.pt|a more bustling thing for people
mels/011514.pt|i said actually if you really look into it this could be a really good thing
mels/024240.pt|it gets a bad ad because it literally is one of
mels/000831.pt|the guy doing you know crazy
mels/013492.pt|she wouldn't have said yes to marry me there's no
mels/008054.pt|it's not like i could send it back in
mels/013146.pt|it'd be a problem dude it's
mels/001228.pt|and i've had to hire people
mels/027777.pt|damn you love to see that from
mels/030992.pt|in like uh i've seen mobster movies
mels/013192.pt|well sticks what a terrible terrible username moist mozzarella sticks
mels/021494.pt|and usually it's pretty soon so when they borrowed all this stock when it was like five dollars hoping to go to four dollars they said we'll pay you back in a month
mels/008804.pt|we just pay that so yeah it's interesting
mels/026307.pt|and in fact led them to their three trillion
mels/030079.pt|hey you pikachu was coming i look at the end and then about article it's coming it's coming it's coming i'm talking hey you pikachu is coming i look at the nintendo power article it's coming it's
mels/029531.pt|the world biggest names in melee and he gets invited to cast the
mels/028705.pt|league of legends is having its first major stadium filling tournament in the west staples center sold out league of legends world championships season three faker goes on
mels/019221.pt|by the way if you have any idea of what technology was like in
mels/029441.pt|yo thank you g and then
mels/004536.pt|well my guess that it's fine that i actually have a little bit of a delay here
mels/031325.pt|i'm so sorry and they're like apparently that bodega has a high shoplifting rate and so because shoplifting is a problem
mels/025690.pt|rorschach inkblot test the ad doesn't
mels/008204.pt|get me in a room with kevin and that's going to grow
mels/018981.pt|in dollars prime video spends like
mels/018742.pt|in one thousand dollars for an iphone blah blah blah
mels/026215.pt|and i would like to talk really
mels/018175.pt|youngest i am seven years away or if you
mels/000225.pt|one of the best drinks i've ever had in my
mels/013439.pt|told me his daughter's name is rey
mels/030458.pt|i don't i want to tell drugs but let's
mels/025466.pt|are congress people pressure your local business people let's try and get gotcha game mechanics into all of our workplaces for a better and happier life
mels/031551.pt|what i think is considered the greatest
mels/007471.pt|i had my spork and i held it up and i said
mels/031988.pt|how the times have changed it's so funny
mels/010018.pt|i wouldn't call you a virgin
mels/013976.pt|so i would like you guys to be aware
mels/003153.pt|it from all different directions number one apple and their new quote unquote privacy push which essentially has been described as robbing the
mels/000778.pt|the that we ended up not doing it
mels/024551.pt|whoa to web and and do this easier so for example if you're in spotify and you want to pay for spotify premium if you do it through ios apple gets a cut but
mels/029625.pt|i think the way it started was it was going to
mels/004337.pt|that would have different opinions i think i have a slightly different take on whether the
mels/010677.pt|that's the place where we go bloons the boss will push your
mels/016877.pt|if you go by age this this orange
mels/023413.pt|oh but you might have cheated
mels/019212.pt|it's about to change the game I'm
mels/029998.pt|we had every single coomer on twitch okay
mels/000158.pt|so first off it's four of us okay and we start out and we hit vegas and we're just
mels/012027.pt|so they give you a lightsaber but it's
mels/028024.pt|for the past few months i've been given win
mels/011250.pt|yeah we got two plane tickets to texas
mels/025148.pt|peanut butter spoons and drinking ice water
mels/021766.pt|it's time for an ad that
mels/020991.pt|the characters it's 15 seconds long
mels/017042.pt|talking about the matrix and that wasn't even like that wasn't even the whole
mels/000927.pt|what do you want you want twenty
mels/005009.pt|and he's rich man on earth
mels/028919.pt|symbol that i was so visibly drunk apparently we walked back with a number of friends though the major last piece of the
mels/005710.pt|cole cassidy guns and uh everyone else in the group other than
mels/016309.pt|one warehouse number one buy a mile
mels/025217.pt|who is hiring for a new open world game
mels/003562.pt|also where it seems more powerful which it does when you're
mels/024142.pt|what they did and it was leading to big
mels/020728.pt|this is it cost them literally nothing they could just type it and it went viral so congratulations for one of the
mels/016541.pt|i think the worst job to be unless you're absolutely generationally great
mels/009761.pt|in spoil i there's no thing to spoil after

mels/012370.pt|if the code for me or something the code

mels/017432.pt|and i sit at home drinking green smoothies and meditating i'll have

mels/020995.pt|give me your votes for the snickers
mels/016293.pt|the lord and talking about how developers
mels/004394.pt|you know there's no it's a ps is for a
mels/028386.pt|trillion meetings in our economy that have been stalled on a let circle back for till the end of time if we could just circle back for once i bet our economy would double i think
mels/016058.pt|i'm sorry somebody said they used a truck as their marketing
mels/017819.pt|in marketing monday on the clock model please
mels/004716.pt|i said do not be harsh with the cuts
mels/025152.pt|and they really went all in on luda
mels/024440.pt|when beings we are not desensitized to this yet so if you're walking around
mels/007385.pt|if the reddit community really hated mango for
mels/013419.pt|cause one of the lights is out yeah and i get it i don't know if it's worth
mels/023432.pt|my average demographic and thinking about myself
mels/010486.pt|the wizard melon for the one gift
mels/006819.pt|it's probably not good to do
mels/020262.pt|it's so important marketers get lost in the idea
mels/016443.pt|are you know government assistance or relief
mels/008702.pt|so much stuff that i think is unlikely and
mels/018802.pt|warranted but uh you guys have reviewed
mels/021324.pt|listen streamers make a lot of money from subs but the amount of money you would make from having a popular game massively dwarfs that i'm getting i'm getting closer to the
mels/032387.pt|this is within probably 20 attempts
mels/008914.pt|and person and i think he's cool and he's
mels/015324.pt|by the standards of any other studio in the history of television was no issue
mels/029106.pt|was this time knowing where i came from i was hustling all over
mels/009136.pt|all the comments in the last video
mels/020272.pt|i'm in that range i like it this is not a holiday
mels/014509.pt|want to go before this when he starts
mels/015589.pt|watch chance the rapper's punk show outside of risky reels which was until until recently the only place you could watch it you can finally get roku tv and watch it now i still think they've probably overpaid
mels/018310.pt|an ad for a samsung monitor it
mels/026127.pt|you could possibly imagine if you guys don't know jack dorsey ceo of twitter was a
mels/027857.pt|the outflows which there is and so these
mels/020458.pt|also versions of this game they're extremely buggy they run at very low frame rates
mels/007818.pt|will do wins it fails today and we'll do wins and fails today
mels/022701.pt|it's because they had to hit a hundred
mels/024617.pt|what the question and so they are uh
mels/021969.pt|if the little boy he counted the number of puffs of her cigarette in one day and then the next day he did the math and he
mels/025022.pt|and i don't know what to say about that other than
mels/011054.pt|sphinx what did this friend do we are all
mels/001973.pt|i would vastly up the price um make a cool brand make them have
mels/015300.pt|if the also bought the warner estate which was basically the biggest most
mels/007107.pt|not interest to the only thing you watch and
mels/019046.pt|it wouldn't change your interaction i'm
mels/003907.pt|people are saying that it might be mark
mels/024164.pt|what's friend he knew to join him to help pump the numbers up and so his two streams back were
mels/005523.pt|are you drunk now no i'm not drunk now
mels/008108.pt|right i no i i see what you're saying
mels/013557.pt|i just sort of dove into the numbers with
mels/026578.pt|while this entire problem one is just having some filter of pr
mels/024953.pt|loser and here i am four months later into the game greetings fellow masters i
mels/028138.pt|unfortunately none of it turned out to be true so now they had to release a financial
mels/024747.pt|consumers from their money and we are starting to see that seep into all aspects of
mels/026076.pt|i played league of legends and there was a funny clip out of it
mels/017321.pt|human history there's not been um a private
mels/002161.pt|yeah okay okay right that's cool i love it
mels/031267.pt|can barely tell and right as this game happened this
mels/019821.pt|but the most important is this column they added all of these things all these things they talked about
mels/011331.pt|right i forgot all right all files
mels/025996.pt|i eating ass that's a big deal congrats to pbr for
mels/011833.pt|we tried it and so i get in i get on the ship and
mels/012706.pt|fucking degenerate like i was it doesn't take that much time because you play a game or two of league
mels/006467.pt|okay that consumers were not ready to spend
mels/029800.pt|i was like oh just joking about scars falcon
mels/025541.pt|your workers went on strike um
mels/025516.pt|and dollars the demand for ps5s
mels/015254.pt|netflix is being considered by customers as like
mels/021469.pt|places that stop people from trading
mels/006533.pt|interest so you can buy things over time you understand apple's not in that business they didn't make this product this
mels/001688.pt|i could probably talk about it but grandpa joe literally lives for himself and he
mels/007850.pt|can you believe it today's marketing monday is actually
mels/014175.pt|i went for ludwig and let me tell you i can't speak to contract numbers i know them which
mels/027531.pt|as sort of get twitter of the right track and all that i really think he added was an f t profile pictures so overall you can say as sort of get twitter on the right track and all that i really think he added was
mels/029205.pt|i was not really not as much
mels/000167.pt|this next part i don't think any of you could guess for any reason there's legitimately no way
mels/007019.pt|i that i really wanted to shout them
mels/028651.pt|weird like there's nothing to camp out for there's no line there's no big release
mels/007011.pt|he didn't just get me a random
mels/013835.pt|bit about gaming for all while sony's about
mels/016258.pt|i was the lakers have lost 43
mels/015354.pt|all your money youtube pays all your money
mels/010627.pt|at the screen and starts going point by point like
mels/022726.pt|it was like before our windows phones anyway
mels/010109.pt|at the title i do need to do that
mels/030844.pt|and will that give you a better chance at getting a job at
mels/014484.pt|i would trust what your gut tells you that's what i
mels/023599.pt|this is a food bank now workers
mels/023536.pt|i was against companies with lower prices so for example you're thinking of maybe
mels/019646.pt|okay well listen to that way i'm loving it
mels/013445.pt|you know strong female character you're just a
mels/024229.pt|by microsoft the most valuable company in the world called empowering what is technology what can it
mels/021471.pt|which means tomorrow we could be in for
mels/028654.pt|looks at me weird opens it i
mels/013989.pt|now pay later option because it's been proven to almost double
mels/029256.pt|the team menu on that day many pokemon ended up getting
mels/016688.pt|rather than design and that is why you might see this the apple car is almost all but confirmed this is not what it'll look like i don't think but based on leaks from apple they are
mels/020668.pt|do we do a lot of things
mels/008007.pt|don't want to catch up on some of the listen there's
mels/018648.pt|monopolies what if microsoft bought discord that's not crazy
mels/026690.pt|would have been terrible for the company there's no way he actually does it but again twitch caved
mels/026522.pt|people that love you from gaming and they they just hate
mels/010891.pt|want to try it all right so it's eight o'clock potato one and i have a reveal for you
mels/022996.pt|is one of the most profitable things in the history of technology it literally prints money because you
mels/008156.pt|well we could do a surprise guest appearance
mels/002147.pt|the official launch of the new party is my birthday did you invite yang is it a conflict

mels/000172.pt|was a movie dude it was crazy we don't remember got was a movie dude it was crazy we don't remember a goddamn thing
mels/029424.pt|i totally forgot there was a purpose this story i told you like
mels/020389.pt|i have notes or like i have
mels/024623.pt|i think to sum it up in one word is is
mels/010416.pt|i see that you guys are complaining but i looked this up recently actually as recently as yesterday and internet speeds in canada are on average much faster and much cheaper so
mels/008685.pt|matt levine if you guys want
mels/020736.pt|to qualify the ad must have released during this calendar year and again let me say this was a year of a global pandemic where almost every
mels/002754.pt|have a more deserving person for this
mels/018653.pt|if very smart suggestion i wasn't even thinking about that but they are actually at the perfect stage of their life to get acquired what's your favorite xbox game franchise let me list all the great ones well there's halo
mels/013850.pt|in this they didn't steal it
mels/027671.pt|it must can make twitter very profitable very
mels/007800.pt|whereas on me and then i go
mels/009738.pt|if they want my my nimble and dexterous palms
mels/005043.pt|truly a great business idea this is actually a
mels/015330.pt|on the wheel of time do you guys know
mels/023369.pt|and he posted this and i was looking at it and i was like wait this is wrong

mels/030182.pt|and it was it was adults only because there was a drinking there was there was booze being served so you couldn't get in if you weren't over
mels/013703.pt|you could make money off that if you weren't spending all your time working on square anyway let's hope let's hope it
mels/008325.pt|one day where he just couldn't make any more vids
mels/010046.pt|the golfing ranges you've had three wives you don't care about our lives well enough is enough
mels/012793.pt|keep the team together stanz would say nice things and like
mels/020063.pt|were three greatest acquisition of all time
mels/007040.pt|it i asked for no notches it has perfect
mels/012732.pt|unpredictable if you work really hard sometimes you don't make it like you
mels/028827.pt|outside of that i lived at the office i
mels/008928.pt|did they even put in his chuck norris tweet chuck mate and they said for musk it would seem
mels/011444.pt|your current skills it's a deal i'll see you on wednesday it's tomorrow i'll get on a flight now
mels/013532.pt|his name was john and he played jigglypuff

mels/020649.pt|team and these lights can get the camera to focus on me please please
mels/029492.pt|it he starts beating people in it
mels/007339.pt|bet you hi congratulations on i think we went even
mels/010056.pt|revival that this is literally revival i want you
mels/028096.pt|in value because everyone was scared that it was jack ma the ceo
mels/006628.pt|i can't tell you what's worse though sitting next to my dad i'm wasting money and watching that game or
mels/017018.pt|without warming up first shooting around okay it's but it's even more difficult
mels/012560.pt|well i saw almost all my
mels/029662.pt|it's time for the main event and the rap song starts playing left
mels/009850.pt|the thing about it's so funny because like every building has parking requirements
mels/004108.pt|as an nvidia intern and you know it's fun little things and it was nice and all the comments were like
mels/001921.pt|is the only reason you keep your
mels/007586.pt|go to more melee stuff this year as it opens up and uh i'm excited
mels/031757.pt|why is this a link i want to
mels/010127.pt|i can confirm that you are though it sounds like
mels/022574.pt|be a prank this would only be a
mels/031495.pt|it has the mental part of chess and you have to be fast and not just fast but really really really like
mels/012151.pt|been conspiring with the first order how
mels/015673.pt|if the the you will have massive success but they're
mels/013489.pt|better at it i know for a
mels/011002.pt|oh yeah you mentioned there's no boss oh god
mels/017335.pt|so there is a positive benefit i'm not going to
mels/030643.pt|know what what two nations border the united states of america and
mels/017429.pt|at the compartmentalize it for me
mels/018164.pt|the victory i'd be happy okay i'm looking for
mels/000687.pt|but we're this little room and we think
mels/011987.pt|rooms you're not supposed to and
mels/015871.pt|why would disney plus make a bundle with netflix they just won't do it
mels/025718.pt|of came up with skittles presents bite size
mels/005857.pt|at the end of the day no one got hurt extra emily's got all the money and it's doing
mels/022233.pt|that's what would happen for me so i was like wow
mels/013124.pt|at his expense i don't think you got any of it
mels/000229.pt|it's a gamble and again it's pretty late now so
mels/002758.pt|and quack get working on a video for this because we need to make the money back
mels/031049.pt|they might not find me again dude
mels/001283.pt|same time i would watch fear factor and the
mels/004332.pt|did it better he didn't get the cr
mels/031900.pt|you put a lot of time into this
mels/023888.pt|this is a good market this
mels/024995.pt|the athletes aren't standing for the flag or
mels/029206.pt|people in general don't sub or
mels/010559.pt|i worked out today i was at the pool a little bit i have no desire no you're literally
mels/000117.pt|how long has your beard gotten in your
mels/027620.pt|gain a bit of leverage over the town square the idea is that twitter is a town square of public opinion it is where a lot of news stories are broken it's a powerful weapon and controlling the
mels/004819.pt|this just came out this came out yesterday
mels/021902.pt|much more likely to fall asleep on time and get good sleep and if i get good sleep then i can actually have the energy to work out the
mels/014342.pt|live scrubbing very smart you have to do these things first whoever
mels/017913.pt|what's a one and done but a marvel movie okay they have good
mels/008817.pt|the other the upside i guess is that you know a lot of people have said so since he started talking about twitter tesla stock is down about
mels/005871.pt|at the table trying to find
mels/026144.pt|instead of just banning him they
mels/001904.pt|and what's funny is i have no
mels/013594.pt|of your make and model and
mels/002046.pt|is it a tick tock thing is that what it is crucifix earrings tick tock
mels/018095.pt|no time for women only time for pepsi
mels/005770.pt|let me tell you something remember how i mentioned
mels/032048.pt|the joke into shiz shooting up a gas station
mels/001733.pt|get there because they don't have it
mels/007906.pt|i want to see what your key messages though which was that you said check this out flip your monitor upside down four five three three three three three
mels/027363.pt|is it relevant does it matter to gamers i think we've proven that it does
mels/025729.pt|than trying to go big on a platform let's watch the other ones see if they're any
mels/018444.pt|the elephant in the room that no one's talking about
mels/026610.pt|if something doesn't do it they probably don't work with you again but they don't want the the hassle of like not paying because then they might
mels/024865.pt|convenience being able to cut down on the grind being able to get something quicker than everyone else that is where you can get absolutely massive amounts of money and in fact for example
mels/030126.pt|we're all the games i'll say
mels/011949.pt|with the halls everyone's supposed to
mels/004244.pt|against my advice very smart very smart
mels/011721.pt|okay and then i pull open
mels/007852.pt|if of tupac shakur i was work it was good
mels/028092.pt|will fail at all it is what i call what's
mels/028142.pt|it's spending 80 million dollars on but they
mels/006649.pt|like i've been saying at least
mels/016422.pt|the regular person or the money
mels/004309.pt|maybe your ears are off everything about that dare pause and say
mels/008692.pt|it just seems very obviously like he is trying to find a reason that is publicly you know that
mels/015024.pt|this is a picture of a commercial i
mels/020887.pt|misinterpreting steel chats ideas for your job brilliant give me an idea right now give me a marketing idea your films i want to steal it what's your idea frames when games that's my idea you made this i made this nvidia graphics trading cards
mels/030433.pt|it'll be good to do it like that would make sense is valentine's day because we're
mels/018523.pt|we make their own okay and sony knows this okay and
mels/026272.pt|three billion verizon 3 billion verizon a
mels/000108.pt|i didn't know if it made sense because you know we are friends we found out in person
mels/026845.pt|what were they thinking this is a true waste of money and that's
mels/029884.pt|in the the first meeting i get to have with mango is mango's house
mels/026834.pt|long know that it costs about 14 million
mels/008775.pt|guy from columbia university clinton said musk's argument will probably guy from columbia university quinn said musk's argument would probably fail in
mels/015478.pt|scarlett johansson sues them for breach of contract they're just locked into a lot of contracts that want to keep things the way things are
mels/021814.pt|in all that so if you're watching this on youtube it is my personal mission
mels/008185.pt|i think if you like to cook they'd fire but straight up i'm sticking with factor because factor i
mels/014174.pt|wide range of connection and they went
mels/027809.pt|they didn't want to actually do it they know that if they actually do it
mels/001663.pt|wow factor where did wow factor go where did my factor
mels/012906.pt|my friends um i think even like ludwig and
mels/004788.pt|when he said this and has been aware that twitter had bots there was no
mels/025530.pt|the bolster their first party lineup
mels/009320.pt|i was around and i and and ari had
mels/028971.pt|was a package from my mother it was full to the brim of gummi bears
mels/031637.pt|and then he had fun he had fun for the
mels/011197.pt|for easy money get into streaming
mels/004409.pt|which i will explain i think correct me if i'm
mels/029253.pt|i thought it was super sick this was when destiny and his followers began their second attack turning what should have been a simple use of the pc into a nine hour
mels/027696.pt|it's a great way to do it is public.com
mels/008850.pt|what are you talking about the original
mels/011770.pt|and like four different people and i noticed
mels/030196.pt|and i will say probably one of the most impressive things i've ever seen from him he
mels/019388.pt|next quarter we put them almost entirely out of business by the way this is the one quarter i could find where we didn't have a
mels/025745.pt|and it has a warning at the beginning oh
mels/019911.pt|and quake and his software he became
mels/020103.pt|'em ceo it's funny i found some old articles from the time
mels/007183.pt|i'm a grinder i know i never like
mels/012155.pt|in trip we don't have a droid i felt
mels/005923.pt|i'm sure every single person in the
mels/013182.pt|all live in one lab why would my audience be so localized to an antarctica lab how does that make
mels/009004.pt|read for sure and i think they made pretty compelling
mels/020314.pt|okay so i got you something dude you did
mels/016863.pt|been growing at a massively 10x
mels/013237.pt|they forgot to talk about the direct
mels/010060.pt|any hoot it's five o'clock which means it's time for get
mels/012061.pt|it was done kind of early and then when it was over i didn't get invited to much of that stuff because i was on the evil track so the lightsaber guy who was the most
mels/005813.pt|by the way i think he has that chance i think
mels/027603.pt|certainly coming back in some form or another there's another major concern here number one is the employee reactions
mels/005734.pt|i think he's a smart guy i i do now now
mels/007491.pt|hold up a big circular plate i i really don't know what it was why are those balls named the same thing
mels/028003.pt|if the the game this year it's making 2022 seem a
mels/026954.pt|we'll clean ad that that really pitches their
mels/025735.pt|be purchasing the candy again the kids don't buy the candy around halloween the kids get the candy and i think
mels/031944.pt|recently in the news at the time where a
mels/000159.pt|going to have a simple time
mels/031402.pt|a budget like we just get the chill in the
mels/022071.pt|and that's like basically what we would tweet on
mels/012106.pt|over there and so we walk over and it's me
mels/021327.pt|including myself by the way are not creators and
mels/004217.pt|like saying nazis are bad and
mels/030964.pt|okay with that that's a really good idea
mels/008531.pt|is more likely now that i've really done my research i looked at legal precedent so
mels/023299.pt|and i think a large part of it was due to coke's great response coke actually
mels/028112.pt|if this is about face clan i want to talk
mels/011662.pt|and more importantly if i talk about
mels/000320.pt|there's like this big warehouse uh they've
mels/000414.pt|degenerate fast coin flip game of all time so i put
mels/019667.pt|did you ever show anybody at your work once it was done
mels/018321.pt|there's private companies that are startups
mels/007364.pt|were hugging we were hugging like the end of world war ii by the way i was there similar
mels/015875.pt|that's the problem but also people don't want to spend that much money on cable the reason they liked streaming services because they could spend way less to get a bunch of stuff so now people
mels/020821.pt|close second error oh there he said it at the end
mels/029334.pt|i'm coming off not as someone who should work there but as someone
mels/001303.pt|being a thing pranks are funny i feel like
mels/021816.pt|your heart and hit that button and turn it from red to gray it would really mean a lot
mels/031475.pt|that which is crazy you think about how money's how much
mels/022494.pt|if the video that i wrote and starred in uh for
mels/019970.pt|turn it into pixar while he was fired from apple and he in that time founded pixar
mels/000717.pt|you know got the top of
mels/011496.pt|it wasn't really a joker movie you understand it was like it was very obviously they pasted on the fact that
mels/020144.pt|yeah that's a funny that's funny it's right
mels/012952.pt|i'm sure there's some worth but the problem with graduate
mels/014004.pt|if they can take me ludwig's got some youtube money
mels/032042.pt|smoke weed all day part i was
mels/017725.pt|we're just marketing that makes you feel more part of the apple ecosystem once you buy an apple product you get access to the blue
mels/016631.pt|well yeah it used to be 70 in the
mels/000054.pt|to dozens of marking articles and i put together a marketing monday of course dude i sat there on a laptop in the
mels/007100.pt|it's obviously obviously i've already seen
mels/023680.pt|one second are you defending this
mels/006758.pt|if the the do that that'd be really really fun i'm super duper down
mels/010940.pt|meals which are quite delicious today i'll be showing you this one this is the
mels/025822.pt|that my friend jimmy wong had to tweet a
mels/009703.pt|it feels great hey there pal
mels/021271.pt|and if you'll notice if you watch any big creators you'll notice some of the biggest creators are doing not just fine on youtube but amazing on youtube for example tommy
mels/002816.pt|and whether or not i mean he's still he's saying he didn't do it he actually said not to do it in a very specific way
mels/020884.pt|and i should just quit this job and start my own business theoretically you could but
mels/011093.pt|really care what you ask everyone's doing and
mels/022109.pt|is over and over terrible so what you want to do is not do
mels/011478.pt|the that's not good but um
mels/022411.pt|scene where they recognize how important where you're watching it is to the ad experience and so they built an ad entirely about
mels/013918.pt|is there are starting to pop up that are having massive success under a model that is being called
mels/018732.pt|apple's the most valuable company on earth how
mels/022604.pt|playstation flow one serious piece of
mels/008588.pt|twitter management did not want to take the deal but because
mels/009514.pt|pretty good he got at least plat right
mels/022435.pt|well they didn't talk about speed or price or powerful and
mels/031311.pt|was stupid but it's also hubris so i put the water bottle back okay
mels/006604.pt|it's great i think eric did a really good job
mels/030293.pt|if the wedding i'll run on marby's
mels/013927.pt|are empowering you this is debt this is loan sharking under a different name it is debt it is actually worse and more expensive than credit cards and everyone you look at the reasons people
mels/011493.pt|it's still safe to say can
mels/019339.pt|instead of the travel market we were traveler only company and we made fat margins because we had almost all the traveler market
mels/017519.pt|and and into a bigger topic do you guys remember when i did the three lines marketing monday anyone remember it wasn't my most popular marketing monday but it was an interesting one it was about a way of thinking about marketing uh
mels/021098.pt|in solve it airlines suck yeah that's relatable
mels/025119.pt|and they made the worst possible ad they
mels/027538.pt|prep disaster just years of uh
mels/005175.pt|oh i think my the big reason was
mels/030628.pt|if the of germany i i hear there's going to be a geography be at school except
mels/030038.pt|you took it was in 1972
mels/024177.pt|youtube is is playing a game here where they want to get a lot of people they're
mels/003678.pt|nice to the 70s and in that era basically
mels/001909.pt|worry i've never thought of that i've
mels/020905.pt|grow at four percent you can invest and get
mels/017089.pt|it's it's not a recent photo it's like literally from
mels/001171.pt|as i was like the only person using enough
mels/010155.pt|or to your dad today he's
mels/003869.pt|here's a chance biden doesn't run again i think there's a chance biden doesn't run again
mels/022504.pt|because it's like it associates their brand with
mels/003708.pt|we'll just steal it make their own version
mels/024797.pt|or more direct for example in
mels/021491.pt|and and pay you back later
mels/026515.pt|it's largely because of like uh almost like
mels/015836.pt|that's not a joke the average viewer
mels/030575.pt|the game change the paradigm rethink everything
mels/029608.pt|if the that iconoclasm iconoclasm that's a new
mels/016055.pt|take that other than that i don't really care
mels/029547.pt|if you go on stage you're like smash four it's
mels/015948.pt|where's the same bill because you'll quit if you
mels/014913.pt|at the canadian hacker he must have made a good amount of money
mels/026098.pt|in my life sorry i'm not high my portfolio is yeah
mels/001625.pt|it's in the morning and once at night and just me exploring it and trying all
mels/018146.pt|and pepsi city dude this is the finale the finale
mels/021027.pt|southwest airlines want to get away
mels/002637.pt|but i you know we have to stick to the rules of the game otherwise
mels/009308.pt|what about removing credit card payments
mels/018535.pt|in the netflix of gaming prints dollar bills and you need games
mels/001395.pt|it would be a bad idea five minutes ago and then you guys all said good one
mels/008896.pt|you know conservative elon musk let's go kind of side of it i think they think of twitter as like in their mind it's like a woman with pink hair and a blue
mels/020015.pt|what happened here elon huh this is elon musk at paypal when it was acquired
mels/025978.pt|past few years riot and blizzard and what their different strategies
mels/008845.pt|some insane evidence of of willful fraud on twitter's part over a series of years and they secretly have you know 10x the
mels/017707.pt|the have used it to a friend in the world it is one of the greatest measures of brand
mels/000029.pt|you guys are gonna notice it get over it my
mels/001134.pt|that is just probably not solving
mels/009978.pt|as a couple of nice guys getting their jackets after you after you after you after you after you after you've seen that scene i mean
mels/025993.pt|are part of a campaign called wet january because apparently it's popular for people who have alcoholism or drink too much to try a dry january to give it up
mels/004212.pt|it's the europe and china plenty of crazy updates
mels/020360.pt|really need to review it's just one of the longest running holiday ads ever it gets the point across so succinctly and they combo this with the special wrapping of the the packaging usually candy spikes around halloween hershey's kisses spike around holidays
mels/023980.pt|it's only fans okay they're not stupid they are fully aware that the money their cash cow is sex workers titties being out makes them
mels/003024.pt|or um there was a different theater where
mels/001957.pt|it's kind of just done live and you make a video out of it it's the one thing i think about but outside of that i'm look i'm i'm
mels/017733.pt|if the apple ecosystem the green and blue bubbles the genius bar at purchase they
mels/014491.pt|that i'm calling the bagel metaphor the world of
mels/007101.pt|if the game of thrones but ever since
mels/016730.pt|if the shoe it's actually a massive benefit to the
mels/005268.pt|he tries to betray and then he
mels/001561.pt|or the americans in my chat
mels/005235.pt|so i get there and apparently i had like vip tickets ready at will call but i didn't know that so i'm with ari and i brought some of
mels/006329.pt|the only thing i need to make sure that i have is this
mels/001682.pt|purpose as such willy wonka and the chocolate factory is a
mels/012097.pt|there was one dude he was like an older guy he was like
mels/018134.pt|wait what pepsi owns the government
mels/018796.pt|it is an iconic ad of the time in modern
mels/022331.pt|that was my first year at twitch
mels/006671.pt|psychological triggers they they they they
mels/014097.pt|i want to show you guys but i don't want to leak anything else
mels/004985.pt|and so i i can't imagine
mels/015571.pt|as their own streaming service and uh or you can have
mels/000877.pt|what do you want in this world
mels/004904.pt|was it to go into motion he backed out he
mels/000097.pt|is your one one thousand they give
mels/012672.pt|at at the be honest um
mels/029217.pt|in-person tasks for team liquid there was a big um starcraft tournament and liquid hero
mels/021838.pt|all the way back to 1997
mels/010419.pt|you know what i haven't done in a while no wait i do this
mels/030009.pt|go to your door right now how
mels/029379.pt|about it and i realize if i just realized
mels/032260.pt|you know just like a little
mels/000342.pt|well he he didn't get the whole anyway i'm gonna
mels/026281.pt|so this is where the yep clock model comes in please give me your yep clocks and this divides all of the interactions that
mels/008271.pt|and it's the first time people got to see like someone
mels/026368.pt|the becoming deeply embedded in the apple ecosystem and buying again uh genius bar
mels/015011.pt|and the king of the jungle we have netflix okay and i want to play a little sound that i had quack pull for
mels/020024.pt|that that's revenue i'm sorry 50 billion is
mels/006427.pt|at the upgrade your town hall to the next level
mels/003893.pt|i don't think anyone beats him in the primary of republican side
mels/017006.pt|not a huge one but a good one i think it's an interesting one i think it's
mels/019409.pt|because you know what if i had a team of more people they would have outvoted me on the quarter six
mels/031506.pt|you are even the best of the best players do everything wrong there is not a single thing like in
mels/019958.pt|the big big big hits okay movies that did hundreds of millions
mels/007871.pt|well actually interesting that you say that you might have accurately predicted an upcoming marketing monday are you married yet
mels/009268.pt|well you better vote you better vote who's going
mels/011929.pt|and the cruise director's like yes we're on the
mels/026836.pt|what it costs to create these are very very expensive and again you only get
mels/010451.pt|and make sure that i have every
mels/026824.pt|five percent of the time i try to talk about talk about
mels/022335.pt|all of our stuff go dark our website go green everything go pure green everything just
mels/015838.pt|okay cable is extremely old so it's
mels/007538.pt|my burger i'm sitting right next to taffo
mels/003693.pt|the you know like the 20s
mels/021986.pt|i want you to personally know that while i think
mels/024786.pt|well for stardust it's all way
mels/019169.pt|good you have to find a way to be somehow stand out or be distinct otherwise people just generally people by default will go to whatever this the bigger one is copying the marketing even if there's a slightly better is not the way
mels/020738.pt|said these uncertain times instead of
mels/006854.pt|i don't have a private gym like blood okay
mels/029948.pt|he throws ice at children man he goes nuts good times
mels/027514.pt|as a week on twitter didn't care there was no progress i myself have visited twitter headquarters and i was stunned it's a very nice building in in like the heart of downtown san francisco you know really expensive real estate so back in
mels/007184.pt|peak amount of grind for melee i did get top
mels/012089.pt|we're like super good and i was recognized
mels/019803.pt|i came out it wasn't really anything like the concept art
mels/024774.pt|and they said quote they only think of
mels/010581.pt|you can actually open doors right you can go in and out of doors no problem there's no there's nothing stopping you
mels/002141.pt|the country and every country all the time
mels/023846.pt|it's called back to the kingdom you can sample or download it here so i'm
mels/015574.pt|started going back to normalcy or this
mels/026321.pt|although they chose to display it
mels/000102.pt|i get to a year you didn't make it you didn't make it i
mels/020810.pt|well today i'm finally doing something meaningful with my time wow
mels/030995.pt|i read an article that rent control
mels/001674.pt|funny an entirely new audience and they have a more youthful audience and
mels/014296.pt|until now but youtube's last dick strategy is
mels/005589.pt|or buckets of wings there was buckets of wings showing up there was tons of like

mels/010571.pt|in the world i'm calling him chevron with
mels/010391.pt|he gets off on it it gets off on it he gets off on it he

mels/001634.pt|it will be in the video
mels/006614.pt|it collapsed i don't think i did marketing mondays it
mels/013452.pt|i didn't get it because i've never ran afoul of the law
mels/023288.pt|cristiano ronaldo the world's most famous football player had a clip where he
mels/028374.pt|gets promoted and whoever does it gets fired bandwidth is a big one if you guys don't
mels/028767.pt|to be like no i can't afford housing

mels/007475.pt|like you can get it you're not
mels/011733.pt|but the first people we encounter
mels/027457.pt|as the world's biggest dream fan i have been able to follow all the drama
mels/017924.pt|would company ever think about post purchase to get you back into a repeat customer but
mels/010433.pt|right lots and lots of chicken

mels/031997.pt|to roast scar honestly i wish you were ten percent uglier but then you'd be
mels/022193.pt|i am sorry i'm sorry i'm back i'm back
mels/000826.pt|that was very fun and then there's a lot of
mels/016246.pt|with the graphic to tell the rest of the fans if
mels/004583.pt|so i did factor for what like two three months it
mels/013772.pt|i need to read that news thank god blizzard's in
mels/025290.pt|scrubs and psych are goaded shows what what do you think we're talking about do you think we're just listing shows that were good

mels/003996.pt|there are a lot i know that i miss a couple days i'm
mels/011471.pt|the very human reaction of like when someone you're close to gets something
mels/019586.pt|too bad i didn't know my credit was
mels/015816.pt|it's got the impact in the reach they give him
mels/006921.pt|in fails baby and i'm gonna do it without delay to be honest i almost skipped
mels/018811.pt|hey as boring zombies suits as the
mels/022905.pt|the trial might even be over it was such a powerful comeback
mels/021333.pt|i don't think it's going away at all
mels/006411.pt|make money who cares about the morals
mels/011568.pt|i got this watch from i watched the movie fracture with ryan gosling
mels/004219.pt|it's no longer worthy of big praise i think it's fine it's fine i mean i'm glad they did it's just not that brave
mels/010125.pt|i'm just giving him a ring
mels/024717.pt|the rebound and there's a period of growth and that's actually a good time to graduate and also you want to be
mels/016899.pt|the number of uh online digital creators
mels/031902.pt|i swiped the heart and i asked her out baby
mels/014570.pt|it oh my god well they had it for a little bit they had a rewind but they added recently
mels/016916.pt|it'll give me your amazon prime i really appreciate
mels/030846.pt|it's kind of legendary people talk about it
mels/014477.pt|idea about all the abuse of it blizzard i
mels/027128.pt|and so we're starting to get uh
mels/028770.pt|i wanted it in so bad and she even told
mels/024016.pt|but if they don't pay out if you miss a payout that's when you lose everybody if twitch stopped paying out top
mels/025948.pt|is the overwatch league 60 million dollars for
mels/002787.pt|good looking out you know stay classy
mels/015165.pt|and what's important is this show did not cost a lot to make this show only
mels/013346.pt|and something morally wrong and then admitted it because that makes you sort
mels/025526.pt|way way way way way more money than them when they bought bethesda for
mels/021758.pt|idiot for sure solidad let's put it up
mels/021251.pt|the creator named erac he kind of blew up
mels/001956.pt|if we cannot do it live everything is kind of have to do it live everything is

mels/030034.pt|oh boy it's you know there's nothing like a good awe boys
mels/021037.pt|the competition for a fan submitted ad and this was one
mels/027484.pt|years the photo i have to really sum it all up
mels/021781.pt|why it's so horny you don't really i mean this is not something alexa can actually
mels/030055.pt|and i will prove this with my sat score
mels/029594.pt|in the community very recently is i feel like
mels/023955.pt|i would assume the cola sells worse
mels/021422.pt|it's also one of the ways robin hood makes their money let me explain
mels/007914.pt|and a lot of them are
mels/015188.pt|i mean at this rate we're
mels/009086.pt|wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait i need to find everything for july
mels/027461.pt|at the dream out space twitter spaces maybe chiming in maybe making their own points

mels/000505.pt|middle of next day text me nice
mels/002960.pt|talking about that's that's crazy they

mels/024540.pt|if you make an app on apple store you're not allowed to even tell your customers
mels/027547.pt|and they like their cushy position they want to keep it that is more likely and that seemed to be the reason they were fighting tooth and nail to stop
mels/021592.pt|it's like hold diamond hands diamond is the hardest material hold
mels/027278.pt|ensure that it was their main thing and they've
mels/013877.pt|every one of their games is player base up
mels/006856.pt|no it's insane i no i'm not i would

mels/028256.pt|know somebody who worked directly with this person they made one mistake in their interview explaining the team they worked with and i was like wait i
mels/018082.pt|i am trying so hard right now i am a sweat i am a
mels/016338.pt|supernatural and just gets rid of its
mels/019960.pt|and i remember in the book he says he was looking out at a disney parade and he noticed there wasn't a single character in the float that had been made in the past like
mels/029558.pt|is the first time nintendo's extending us
mels/022614.pt|i can't answer trivia questions or play music but ron uses cutting edge ai to do so much more in 18 different
mels/010133.pt|cats okay things are different now okay
mels/030205.pt|monty matches at one point even after he got rich we had to stop he lost so much money that after he got rich it was nearing over a thousand dollars
mels/015121.pt|from minute one it was the first time people had done this you
mels/029586.pt|we talked about how well you talked
mels/015029.pt|if the movies you want to see and in about
mels/027175.pt|that let's just do what the boomers did
mels/005969.pt|well no that's that's the meme but
mels/028992.pt|the carson beats me in a fight in hand-to-hand combat listen i'm not the biggest
mels/025216.pt|this week i want to give the first win to cd
mels/031010.pt|he was a little bit a little bit nicer to talk to and so i thought we had a rapport going
mels/009661.pt|couple of things that can be improved but uh you
mels/008264.pt|and uh and we are going to talk about
mels/008670.pt|have apparently it'll like all i'm
mels/014083.pt|job mixer in this tweet thereby saving twitch forever ninja would have destroyed twitch
mels/011670.pt|military prison here you can see it
mels/011800.pt|in the hall atrium ship area
mels/013651.pt|starting tomorrow oh man this is a big one
mels/019772.pt|up here let's get to the top 10 most
mels/017668.pt|here's a great example that they have this is an internal leaked apple video okay
mels/027314.pt|it'd be careful here for people who may not have a lot of other things they are accomplished or or proud about it can almost be like
mels/015364.pt|the money money nothing but money infinite amounts of money
mels/028063.pt|cause i wanted to give a fun piece of honor for it and also
mels/004102.pt|it'll work i have something i gotta say
mels/013531.pt|i have been doxie too much lately but his name
mels/023435.pt|well i didn't do it either so i don't know
mels/013867.pt|actions though i did practice uh
mels/022077.pt|engagement even if they both have no followers an example tweet
mels/004268.pt|don't worry about it don't ask
mels/014557.pt|i can let you know that the
mels/029856.pt|we sat in the middle of this rich family's
mels/022465.pt|which is dope as hell it's simple it's
mels/009679.pt|well already wish i was a little bit dumber to be honest i already wish i was
mels/010241.pt|he laughed out loud and he's like no but
mels/017768.pt|invested in this area he would do frequent
mels/011582.pt|at a nice restaurant watching you help motivate me to try harder thank you sir
mels/006250.pt|well that's interesting i guess yeah i remember
mels/001659.pt|women should be valued and treated right you know
mels/025401.pt|i think it's a win but your call
mels/028845.pt|what anyway i had to sleep there but i wanted to be more comfortable so
mels/013187.pt|and i've never heard of this wow that's actually kind of bad
mels/016282.pt|where the game came out they started mandating a
mels/027159.pt|and so what they're trying to do is talk a big game about how hard they're going to be on inflation while
mels/001838.pt|keep up the work king keep up the work you didn't say good work i noticed
mels/017996.pt|is deeply unpopular on the whole
mels/026608.pt|in competitors like disney is so funny oh
mels/001305.pt|yeah i guess yeah i guess i think what it is my theory on all content cycles
mels/005625.pt|i stood out in the dms but we hadn't spoken and
mels/025834.pt|wizard of the situation well first of all they were approached by many many people to make league of legends film and tv properties and they turned them all down to use the people
mels/003168.pt|it's a little farther out and they pivoted the whole company on it
mels/030494.pt|if she doesn't know so we're sitting there it's
mels/010769.pt|that's my that's my experience uh from
mels/001635.pt|although cheaters have already shown up unfortunately if you look at the leaderboards today there's already cheated records on there there's a
mels/019040.pt|we don't like it leave i like this let's just pull up like honda
mels/031752.pt|this wikipedia is so poorly structured you can't say
mels/020550.pt|what is history should i buy their stock that's a great question so that that is actually a good
mels/012506.pt|well they put a lot of effort into it but i think they
mels/025963.pt|and that leaves them with no talent to make the games they need to save
mels/014750.pt|the one hundred drafts of this song and i don't remember
mels/030052.pt|because that was proven untrue that was actually not a good test they did not have
mels/023139.pt|sales skyrocketed through the roof again
mels/005047.pt|have anything too much deeper to say i like
mels/027858.pt|i think bitcoin went under 30k today
mels/003379.pt|a game this happened at the moscow chess open
mels/022765.pt|was not dumb in this mark cuban was
mels/007022.pt|literally like one to one it matches
mels/025200.pt|see if i can finally bring it out of this
mels/008795.pt|in breach of court uh he refuses and tries to stop it and
mels/013643.pt|the most influential a truck has ever been to me
mels/016696.pt|and these are investments that will be extremely important they seem they seem
mels/017406.pt|this isn't like a joke they just think that's me
mels/009364.pt|and you're asking if it's still
mels/017728.pt|that stuff ever will and apple's over investment and really
mels/021913.pt|it picks up speed this is an example for my stream if you make a funny twitch segment it's usually better
mels/004775.pt|and including and especially not limited to uh tesla which dropped about
mels/021846.pt|actual photo of jeff bezos age
mels/013909.pt|the two different ipod shuffles and then i have to plug my headphones into those and so
mels/012127.pt|day is the idea they're going for was good it's just
mels/002239.pt|windsor marketing and things like that yeah but not like well you don't like do
mels/028935.pt|i couldn't smell it because we had a very small dorm but when i got
mels/021147.pt|see one guy in the back with a
mels/008419.pt|so it's like it's never ending circle right
mels/028136.pt|it'll billion dollars they had a bunch of articles
mels/002038.pt|what what am i what am i getting crucifix earrings no i'm not kev walks but does he run
mels/015980.pt|you can't lose then you raise prices and
mels/031025.pt|and then i got a little nervous but i
mels/016095.pt|it's a and not enough about your
mels/004421.pt|one vacation because he's a billionaire or not a billionaire but a very wealthy
mels/005808.pt|the ability to like not to give my friend a chance to still have
mels/027152.pt|the depression the unfortunate thing for biden specifically is that it looks like it's finally happening it looks like the chickens are coming to roost and so he's sort of getting hit with this
mels/018394.pt|well speaking of that that actually segues right in to today's marketing monday topic
mels/002116.pt|would be impossible wait i think 2024 we
mels/007394.pt|it makes more sense you play the game yeah yeah yeah but
mels/001853.pt|and i have to go through his assistant everytime like he responds and i have to go through his assistant every time
mels/000561.pt|we've got tons of money in our pocket we got great food we had a great night everything is good and then we get a call from the the vegas promoter who hooked
mels/008486.pt|we can and then i'm gonna
mels/006599.pt|many pictures wow great job on the release
mels/025093.pt|you know probably less concussions and the
mels/027626.pt|i think ever starts leaning on
mels/011863.pt|in the story of the trip things are happening on the window so it's cool i
mels/019552.pt|autozone jingle and he went absolutely
mels/018964.pt|and you could only watch it on mobile so literally you have to watch with perfect rapt attention chance the rapper try to be ashton kutcher
mels/030213.pt|what he was a tiny man
mels/000801.pt|what i'm thinking like oh it's
mels/018149.pt|i will not be stopped i will not be stopped i won't be stopped
mels/013215.pt|if anything they're too thin now they're too small too nimble
mels/014466.pt|if the want to talk about it what i do want to say
mels/016158.pt|you know who make the in-depth excursions
mels/025662.pt|so i don't think they'll get caught
mels/003795.pt|be more moderate democrats actually no we don't moderate democrats are the reason why we're here to begin with we need to
mels/022379.pt|it though it's probably less scary this
mels/006235.pt|millions millions that is another thing that's that's the problem because you're not sponsored the millions millions that is another thing that's that's the problem because you're not sponsored to play so you're not getting any money
mels/015109.pt|in previous marketing mondays it's one of
mels/021516.pt|there was that rich guy crying on the news in one of the just most disgusting acts of
mels/023687.pt|bmw like the bmw brand with a pride flag
mels/027231.pt|when a game actually refuses to do that and cuts it all back it's also freeing the branding choices that it's made
mels/025854.pt|paid me to go to an event they also paid for
mels/031919.pt|but there was like a step up here into like a little more private
mels/017498.pt|you know and i thought i'd
mels/008409.pt|add up my title game i realized because
mels/020794.pt|i thought that was a fantastic ad for a lot of reasons i think it was one of the first
mels/026930.pt|we don't forget that you saw it moving on next up we got
mels/029503.pt|but it would have been so cool
mels/014126.pt|a single exec started to realize that the
mels/021545.pt|yeah it will say is elon's goofy ass dude
mels/026813.pt|it's a bad it's a dire situation and on top of that they sort of have seen this coming
mels/015426.pt|they have a deeper bench than everyone else
mels/032259.pt|he looks at him kind of like
mels/000247.pt|it down i turn around it is five more of my closest friends from high school that
mels/028625.pt|work one day and i realize
mels/000088.pt|the obviously don't get me wrong i like ari
mels/031854.pt|it's not even on shroud's radar
mels/031515.pt|in a point and then we send another guy and
mels/016909.pt|isn't that is why i hope you liked this marketing monday
mels/009294.pt|you know the developers just don't care about the rest of us people that can avoid them they just make the game get a bunch of players and then harvest the
mels/030782.pt|most lucrative side hustle what'd you mean
mels/014678.pt|obviously it's not water war wednesday
mels/025207.pt|if the for free and required you to pay a lot of money to get anything and players got so furious that the developer
mels/004699.pt|i hope it helps i am not sure the cdc
mels/014350.pt|big predictions that i'd like to drop here is that there is a very real possibility that a company comes along that is not twitch or youtube and makes it very easy to live stream almost like a
mels/020350.pt|to buy their husband or wife a gift
mels/000523.pt|of course so ludwig is in the room alone
mels/018718.pt|with the hardware they're putting in there it's a price so low that consumers stop doing comparisons they stop thinking about well this one has this benefit
mels/027873.pt|how would a recession reset things so
mels/012953.pt|so if you're saying is there any worth in it i probably would not do it like if you're doing grad school
mels/029320.pt|you know a meeting of adults and
mels/014236.pt|up and coming streamers people are like i know a lot of people in this very chat have watched like ludwig's videos on
mels/031653.pt|it reaches out and helps me hold it king
mels/001651.pt|and then i get a cat and i change my
mels/027759.pt|the final win and fail um
mels/006217.pt|if i don't make it by tuesday i always
mels/029358.pt|i was hustling i was really hustling anyway we go to this dinner and the
mels/012405.pt|we ourselves so he puts his fist up and i'm
mels/023946.pt|it's just really smart and that's my final dub
mels/026681.pt|their money to the league but all of
mels/028091.pt|in the fail in a new segment my brand new wins
mels/018226.pt|it's already popular to make their own
mels/008336.pt|i already have a team that i have can't
mels/023252.pt|what was the actual source of these chic
mels/007043.pt|i have literally she'll drop uh
mels/012721.pt|you know of my youth one summer was lost and my people lost way more than that i got out only because i got into something else i
mels/032353.pt|what's not fine is using these
mels/004681.pt|them doing a baseline google search and it's like me photoshopped on the head of a cow
mels/013056.pt|not fair and then i feel bad for students
mels/007303.pt|pride okay just pure pride on that face there's
mels/015007.pt|with the about that what's up
mels/009305.pt|knows that stop them from like targeting children they don't apply to like the exact same things but better and
mels/013220.pt|we met one time in person and you called me a racist
mels/027076.pt|well that anyway with that that is our
mels/020322.pt|well he drinks it i mean he disappears he disappears into the role
mels/024793.pt|was now upload videos saying i lost money on kitchen
mels/026968.pt|i gotta say outside of this awesome bark
mels/017468.pt|and the internet which severely hampered their ability to hire scabs
mels/017297.pt|on this blessed of days winnie the pooh
mels/026110.pt|and when kellogg's posted online applications for scabs to
mels/028662.pt|what they look like like these like these but they're like
mels/012642.pt|yeah if you want to get medication
mels/028446.pt|what's me in his office he buys me subway there was subway
mels/024559.pt|that she's like but even if they push to the web
mels/005834.pt|but i was sitting next to him so i was talking to him the most and he claimed that he
mels/020512.pt|runs surprisingly well on current gen consoles this is 19 days ago
mels/003511.pt|get existential dread but i also understand that
mels/006206.pt|i'm so tired it's just like
mels/028517.pt|it starts becoming this legitimately so
mels/009196.pt|went and it came out really well and it did well and
mels/026106.pt|why it was a powerful image i really really was impressed by it and the
mels/030672.pt|i don't think so and then i like have to turn it to him and
mels/030593.pt|iran cahoots and you guys answer it
mels/009075.pt|and bookstore and i would get games like pokemon so
mels/025156.pt|if you're honest feedback tyler and we'll
mels/023694.pt|have you met the internet do you think that
mels/032010.pt|it episodes of anime with a rough estimate of
mels/023544.pt|it can't be sold for that cheaply
mels/028474.pt|this kid should have just said sir yes sir but he's like no dude
mels/017673.pt|describing what it would look like if
mels/004056.pt|as your employees or the government they're always trying to take the money you earn from playing
mels/009328.pt|if the phone even kids have phone everyone's
mels/011926.pt|i'm going to give you i'm going
mels/011571.pt|is getting so big yeah he's
mels/031466.pt|was able to do this is just is is
mels/029572.pt|and then you know armada and i remember in genesis 1 when

mels/031327.pt|with the full charges like theft so i have to go to the police station like they the police officers
mels/030409.pt|if she was like literally doing her own
mels/019123.pt|geez and that you could have the power within one night to dream
mels/020753.pt|and what do we do we turn to instagram when facebook is torn the world apart we got a celebrities on instagram later this year a lawsuit filed by over forty u s states by the and what do we do we turn to instagram when facebook has torn the world apart we go to celebrities on instagram

mels/024603.pt|fuck month baby the future is truck
mels/032257.pt|if the way this guy he slow
mels/011539.pt|by the day the weaves have infiltrated all aspects of our life and government weebs are everywhere
mels/020293.pt|it could have gone harder with this scene
mels/002722.pt|i can't afford it i got a wedding
mels/011140.pt|say nice things i said really i
mels/004160.pt|you have brought receipts from those 25
mels/031055.pt|crying someone please call ninj let me tell
mels/009070.pt|okay we gotta balance it wait is that it for that
mels/006249.pt|it feels so much sweeter when other people don't have it you know
mels/000851.pt|it sounding but every child grows up that isn't every adult is a child that grew up that's not so true it's not like
mels/025740.pt|getting the message that's the hard part so the either the options are you do it poorly which
mels/030442.pt|this is the this is where it is
mels/026467.pt|at my friend mango here sort of explain a good way to think i've made one of these for nvidia i literally have thought about this at nvidia this is not a this is not
mels/018041.pt|i absolutely crave that delicious taste
mels/004854.pt|is he really no one thinks you made this
mels/026946.pt|in are recounting a lot of trouble nailed
mels/026771.pt|and then they released that the change that made tracking opt in
mels/001867.pt|yeah i mean i can't imagine that like
mels/023164.pt|they're fake yeah they're not really from a grill they just adam it's just
mels/023907.pt|there's no ad you could do
mels/002413.pt|i have to make fun of me for you
mels/026258.pt|when steve jobs released the iphone your
mels/022689.pt|we're going to be hands off but then about a year
mels/028466.pt|okay so so let me try to paint the picture for you
mels/029164.pt|is gonna die and i only have about
mels/019443.pt|i didn't want to start this early we have to review it
mels/029024.pt|story real quick because i don't think
mels/024419.pt|what is one of the coolest
mels/019510.pt|it's definitely our highest rated one thus
mels/007668.pt|it's a weird science experiment or something i don't remember paper mario
mels/031332.pt|in my dad's credit the first thing he did when he landed
mels/028589.pt|add like diamond and master and all that
mels/020450.pt|if all time and i think when you promise somebody this and you give them this there has to be a reckoning there is a problem that is how you get that is how you get this the
mels/022001.pt|the worked out exactly as they wanted on international women's day but the core problem that i see
mels/029764.pt|in that environment like at air
mels/005599.pt|it really hates cod and that he actually no i'm
mels/002159.pt|instead of the real sky i
mels/011421.pt|you back for letting me be your editor well almost i know you're joking but you technically because i let
mels/024917.pt|the bad luck out of the way now the good luck is here and that is of course not how it works it also applies the sunk cost fallacy sun costs the same thing so
mels/007510.pt|you're expecting a classic burger and you eat that for dinner
mels/016352.pt|wins and fails it is a news article that came out today that expressed something that
mels/008557.pt|many accounts on twitter are bots one of every 20 things you see
mels/027615.pt|direction i think twitter's had no
mels/028255.pt|so you have to check references and even better i happen to know
mels/018308.pt|and gave the previous ceo a
mels/004598.pt|just i'll take less pay if they just give me a longer run
mels/012722.pt|what happened but for some reason i i was deep into it and i
mels/013130.pt|working meetings was there anything worth talking about ipso facto r e
mels/004188.pt|like please check i don't think that was you i think that was i think that was probably someone related
mels/019721.pt|the student loan debt has gone
mels/031329.pt|and they're charging me as a crime and so i have to go before a judge and so not only that i have to have
mels/025416.pt|the fully realized unreal engine 5 ray
mels/008329.pt|put some vaseline on it to blur the edges
mels/007856.pt|right here the one you get when you
mels/032410.pt|and this is not a knock it really
mels/030219.pt|if you tapped the ground i think you win
mels/004438.pt|first of all the best type of marketing is marketing that doesn't feel like
mels/016776.pt|do you think we have a lot of boomers now wait till
mels/006080.pt|i can't stand them can't stand them dude i can't stand anyone would write a paragraph about that being like oh my
mels/008870.pt|because that's what they were promised
mels/031491.pt|if there's there's no the levels
mels/010888.pt|for feeding it only encourages me to carry
mels/009418.pt|if you're if you want to say hey just stay in the back don't die put
mels/021341.pt|that button below i am on a
mels/025399.pt|what i would include this one this is a win no
mels/019850.pt|massive massive marketing spend it was
mels/027344.pt|second try because he's actually a soul's
mels/030225.pt|he won that race when he pissed himself
mels/028431.pt|at my bars were fire but uh my relationship with my parents
mels/026660.pt|with uh with this man this guy is like a
mels/008379.pt|influencers today as part of my

mels/006189.pt|please don't cry as long as you have the
mels/019290.pt|based on what I'm seeing the demand for
mels/023451.pt|the perceived value is what the is what the customer thinks of your product customers will only buy something if they think they're getting more value than what it costs now let's say let's say my margin right now let's say
mels/029312.pt|cringe alert i want everyone to know the following story has a cringe alert again i'm just graduated i don't know anything yet i'm stupid i also if you guys know my other story have recently recently given up trying to be

mels/018075.pt|isn't right now it's the refreshing taste of
mels/028405.pt|and someone brings up a point like oh actually how did the
mels/006314.pt|he reached out about a video he said he liked or something and then i
mels/016600.pt|like that is a free cheat card
mels/008733.pt|small amount it needs to be really significant and
mels/025118.pt|get ad for breast milk to bring
mels/007055.pt|his name his birth name was kush and his birthday was
mels/027655.pt|in cash there is no way to make it profitable at current rate of growth so two things will happen one
mels/001487.pt|you are actually possibly the final guest on this brand new amazing show with deep production values atomic i want to ask you first
mels/007353.pt|that was promised we've always wanted a
mels/020632.pt|with scam to win awards which would normally only annoy me but it enrages me when the topic is a global
mels/012918.pt|which is cool it's like a big number but for
mels/025494.pt|what the stock upstart holdings and now he's talking about how great it is on
mels/021682.pt|my grass you figured it out
mels/004516.pt|at making the most baseline like sarcastic joke and everyone's like giving me more credit than i deserve
mels/020712.pt|they are still just as excited
mels/019289.pt|that is all of it well let me just say
mels/016747.pt|if the the this and people have knowledge in this and people that have knowledge
mels/022016.pt|second best time is now and burger king responded by saying
mels/001334.pt|pretty banana and now it's just me and my pal
mels/008190.pt|no of course not i just wore a minion shirt talked about minions promoted the minions movie talked about the same talking points all day because i love it
mels/012051.pt|is the worst part oh oh wait
mels/026190.pt|league every one of their games is
mels/006146.pt|and got a point same as me certainly didn't let me down
mels/013286.pt|we got some good ones i know i started a little late but if you're here
mels/006978.pt|all year or youtube and so you at
mels/001013.pt|they're delicious and nutritious she says and if
mels/000129.pt|there was a little bit of weed
mels/017260.pt|we can make an impact around here
mels/018767.pt|among poorer people because right now
mels/018929.pt|we've been really watch tv and they pressed her and said you must watch something you must watch something if you're going to be doing this
mels/008198.pt|i do for money they paid me in a
mels/010058.pt|that was historical yes that was
mels/014996.pt|and sports used to be the one
mels/007142.pt|like even if it's an innocuous cough i hear every single one you know because like i don't want to
mels/004738.pt|at of elon musk and just ask what the hell's
mels/008992.pt|really appreciate that and it's an honor to have the cutting edge
mels/032296.pt|and so you do as most humans do you check the comments because my
mels/004713.pt|where's dancing in the blue light though i told i told
mels/031794.pt|this is like where people that play call of duty and open packs and chill and say w
mels/003622.pt|it yeah i mean it's it's
mels/020513.pt|no it doesn't dude it doesn't the other thing they did was they didn't allow reviewers to use footage from consoles in their reviews they literally blocked it you were only
mels/009593.pt|it's not a big deal team ninja is still
mels/005464.pt|i don't know i don't get it i don't understand it
mels/031914.pt|i am not we're not going wild here and in the back of the limo was like uh like
mels/030485.pt|and then we can enjoy the food as it
mels/002768.pt|else and then after that i don't
mels/007745.pt|why those didn't sell better they pay for themselves they literally pay for themselves you wear a sigma
mels/002121.pt|we might see the biggest number of
mels/020220.pt|it's the terrible ted cruz is the zodiac killer
mels/017599.pt|and they've over invested in these two areas and it
mels/024578.pt|in the contract because even if the rules change it doesn't matter
mels/003751.pt|service even though they really do want
mels/018715.pt|and so they made a judgment call they said
mels/004613.pt|have you reacted to pay the musicians quincy son of quincy of i reacted to it what he have you reacted to pay the musicians quincy son of quincy have i reacted to it
mels/019093.pt|i think they're not solving the same problem they're still human beings they
mels/001745.pt|the guys very polite nice day isn't it yeah the weather's great and then in the middle conversation he goes whoa and he falls over the side and then the short story shifts to the
mels/015496.pt|it's because the market doesn't think disney can keep growing at the way
mels/005957.pt|you can see hbox is about to pop
mels/024584.pt|from not having fortnite on ios and all this time but before you get to
mels/021474.pt|you don't care if you lose your money
mels/017140.pt|my taxes yeah if you were
mels/031893.pt|i literally walking like to over to her
mels/029406.pt|that's around here she did that she didn't even ask questions
mels/002474.pt|we did a bunch of chips quickly they bought them and so
mels/017652.pt|they have people's attention and they have they have become a great way to give people to finally take the plunge and spend an expensive amount of money on a product it six signifies that conveys that they have people's attention and they have they have become a great way to get people to finally take the plunge and spend an expensive amount of money on a
mels/029266.pt|dubbed lord helix president was the
mels/001546.pt|would you like to participate in this edition of
mels/013992.pt|that's amazing it really works but
mels/017518.pt|jump into the actual marketing monday so let me explain this was going to be a
mels/021607.pt|i say about that but it was the story this is like the only interesting story of the game itself that's why
mels/006101.pt|i fainted for an online tournament that is real he
mels/012288.pt|well he's like being the lando kind of thing
mels/032377.pt|hey i know it can be hard to believe especially if you're having trouble yourself so i made you a video guide i reopened
mels/013881.pt|and i would have given him a win but unfortunately when things do well in the gaming industry
mels/015839.pt|it's not it's not surviving no it's
mels/008620.pt|and and then just go on with his life
mels/018776.pt|i think i've covered the main basics here my my
mels/008310.pt|so we'll do that and then
mels/002231.pt|we're going to launch the new facebook feed pulse that allows streamers
mels/024346.pt|is a big thumbs down and it's so expensive what
mels/007282.pt|so let me tell you a little bit about his sets though because i
mels/009642.pt|i mean we're gonna get this late our champ
mels/009324.pt|called console no shot zero percent i'll i'll stake it i'll bet anyone that
mels/009203.pt|but i guess what you should do is practice
mels/007195.pt|are you to any tournament you want just message me and
mels/018905.pt|you can flip your phone and get a different screen the phone plays in vertical and horizontal what a brilliant idea what a brilliant idea now let me talk to you let me talk to you about the two people making this claim
mels/015452.pt|at the theater than almost every other studio
mels/000789.pt|one as well as love but
mels/012943.pt|i felt like everything that i was saying was way more valued so i took the job but that was
mels/018726.pt|yes maybe one day in the future google stadia and streaming games on xbox
mels/031546.pt|he built it as like a a desperate gambit you build the
mels/016300.pt|was just coming out of cdpr i i trust him through
mels/001572.pt|okay i got a question for you
mels/020990.pt|it's said that he couldn't relate to the
mels/020211.pt|with your meal for 10 times the price
mels/001430.pt|you get no googling i need a scout's honor on no searching or googling
mels/025131.pt|also i'm not even kidding like i actually think
mels/002729.pt|cost money on the deal okay he needs to lose right now otherwise my
mels/031228.pt|and a side story of my life starts to converge that side story is i've started to get into esports this is
mels/031496.pt|harder to master than chess yes yes i
mels/023961.pt|it's going to be a marketing monday on a
mels/010982.pt|of course is coming to theaters and you can get free tickets for by participating or signing up for hellofresh but
mels/024718.pt|earning years as things are really low so when you buy things like a house or stocks or whatever or your
mels/031535.pt|you can't just walk straight over and flash had studied this map so much that he had a brilliant strategy instead of like taking this space in this
mels/009966.pt|until mitch mcconnell finally relents they might actually make some progress he might break down you might do anything to shut
mels/012275.pt|i made it to the finals of everyone on
mels/013691.pt|he is the most passive ceo ever finally he quit today and as someone who owns a lot of
mels/026686.pt|without how to get this money and he basically said we're
mels/010917.pt|i'm gonna play fall guys or i'm
mels/026710.pt|of activision blizzard can get a nice paycheck exit because again this is where the stock was and instead the purchase price that microsoft's buying
mels/008929.pt|twitter the interest of its stockholders the transaction must agree to and the
mels/017535.pt|and the companies that are very good at that outside of the realm of just advertisements are seeing
mels/004671.pt|going to a cinema and wasting time it's about grinding and hustling so you embody the spirit that
mels/004563.pt|i just a tad just just
mels/030033.pt|the be able to do little
mels/013926.pt|that these companies use how they're
mels/017330.pt|pay above minimum wage they pay i think 15
mels/025606.pt|right it's not really right well first of all big reason netflix no longer a top dog but luckily we can change netflix to nvidia
mels/022698.pt|if the companies that spend a lot of money on
mels/015033.pt|it's a month and no late fees 22
mels/010824.pt|what's the most mellow game i play tft actually tft
mels/012369.pt|i was talking to the bartender and she's like listen i heard you have a
mels/015618.pt|more important the last mover advantage which is nothing that's nothing peacock is the latest to the party and has no advantage at all which means they're probably dead yeah this is this is dead dead in the water
mels/018710.pt|winning the console war is not even worth microsoft's time they're thinking bigger so they realized
mels/014821.pt|and ubisoft boss said employee tell
mels/002083.pt|what is ligma and then you take
mels/025194.pt|it's baffling it really is baffling for such an iconic
mels/014278.pt|those things have power because that brings an entire ecosystem people
mels/023439.pt|now if you'll know i spend my work hours working i spend my after work hours streaming or grinding hollow knight
mels/005228.pt|bit first big thing mogul money live uh
mels/020740.pt|but to be truly terrible to stand out you can't just be a
mels/013341.pt|in our main cupboard i put them in the bottom cupboard and i ate a couple of the first box of regular oreos and then i forgot about them and that marketing monday idea for six months and then all the oreos were uh soggy and
mels/005559.pt|it'll take all the streamers from the stadium to the the the house and the narrow streets near the house there was like these overgrown branches i'll miss you to talk about it yet and they like they had a slow down to go it'll take all the streamers from the stadium to the to the house and the narrow streets near the house there was like these overgrown branches oh
mels/021612.pt|in football how cool is that that shows you how much
mels/013293.pt|i that's not how it works do not
mels/016990.pt|we're hollywood needs china for money and china you know chinese consumers want hollywood movies chinese government
mels/031137.pt|i think like instagram stories work
mels/020693.pt|i don't know the fifth award the award for the worst ad that
mels/016839.pt|of a new planet that he can turn into warehouses that is a guarantee
mels/017717.pt|if the form factor that's an advertisement
mels/030299.pt|give you any of you degenerates not one of you i could put in a room
mels/015206.pt|are competing with peacock why try to outbid them on a few things that are only relevant to americans when
mels/014549.pt|this is part of that mention on them
mels/011780.pt|so anyway we go down this long gray
mels/031096.pt|because i know the math i've worked at
mels/016335.pt|plus holden ones in golf so he claims
mels/020323.pt|i need i need that as an alert i need i need that sound bite as a sub
mels/012719.pt|summer that's it and i lost that summer that is
mels/014455.pt|courage in them are just as
mels/027094.pt|first order inflation is a very serious subject you can argue it's the way democracies die when democracy dies
mels/017283.pt|the original winnie the pooh becomes public domain so i think you can see where this is going and i expect
mels/029593.pt|little different facets of things from each other
mels/016956.pt|and so uh feel free to check that out
mels/022901.pt|of their own the phrase it's such
mels/015020.pt|if the this netflix let's talk about
mels/007857.pt|i don't get it what does monday mean
mels/026929.pt|you cringe or be offensive they got the message across this is one of the
mels/031134.pt|i mean like literally like people can  on instagram stories but
mels/015043.pt|two things that i've encompassed in this
mels/018817.pt|i was very successful on my on my scale it
mels/027882.pt|innovation things start to build it's
mels/012156.pt|way way nothing else everything else that we
mels/008064.pt|you are abusing the fact that i know you and you're saying it's really important but it's not going to be important at all and in fact it's
mels/031954.pt|with the scar have i ever watched it on stream
mels/027512.pt|due to the previous ceo jack being a part-time ceo
mels/025715.pt|giving your competitor a ton of attention so you get a crumb you're spending your money to give them more attention scary ad bad one let's do
mels/015855.pt|well as these other guys as as amazon and disney but as like fortnite
mels/001307.pt|in overdo it but it starts to become fake like you know the more money there is in having a hit prank video the more
mels/018551.pt|literally owned by microsoft that is so funny
mels/014312.pt|start streaming and keep streaming on twitch the thing is like
mels/002164.pt|so that your ass is covered
mels/029821.pt|the seventh place chat of kings
mels/011564.pt|and a half hours long and i look at the runtime and i say no every single time i want to watch it i'm sure it's good apparently
mels/022518.pt|over and over again i literally think that would have
mels/009055.pt|doesn't that feel like that time flew by feels very recently feels very
mels/008261.pt|it's like an awesome way for esports fans to
mels/031989.pt|yesterday blur came up to me and said hey ludwig how do you become a full-time twitch streamer blur you worked at twitch for five years what did you do blur you look like you
mels/005967.pt|he's got like 40 tweets on it
mels/017524.pt|if you participate you know the problem with the three lines there is no way for you
mels/019813.pt|it might even be wrong it's no man's sky okay
mels/026149.pt|in lighter news but also equally a fail uh you
mels/012956.pt|you're losing the money you could have made and you're spending money and it's hard so like for grad school you really
mels/004422.pt|we got back he reached out to me we're
mels/024407.pt|gaming has forever changed hey neighbor are you
mels/014521.pt|then miss kiev brought some real
mels/022696.pt|if the one hundred million dollars this year and so now the ad sales team at
mels/029396.pt|i have probably eight dollars eight to twelve dollars in my
mels/015804.pt|there's a lot of a lot of weird
mels/028375.pt|it's don't work corporate environments everyone's talk everyone refers to
mels/013392.pt|in my life i've never done it and i've always wanted to and maybe i'll do it now but
mels/022021.pt|his tweet will be deleted within the day i know it because the second the new story gets
mels/023681.pt|you think this is good you think that's a good tweet
mels/006493.pt|it's talking about what a scam buy now pay later is but i want to give you know
mels/030353.pt|if i'm spending this much time with
mels/000891.pt|course and i'm not talking about the marketing mondays i'm talking about the
mels/024657.pt|and now companies in the west like
mels/024804.pt|is that there's millions of these people sharing their insane luck in polling
mels/013664.pt|the big two me and ludwig going to
mels/001701.pt|as much of a joke as the original website i think it's also true that they are often shared sincerely and that they satisfy a white hot anger towards the
mels/026902.pt|be in the news so much uh
mels/006847.pt|he's now they call me mr nft
mels/014349.pt|be a lot bigger they need to grow broader to have people
mels/024640.pt|is there not going to pay it you guys know that
mels/005774.pt|this is a real story okay hassan and
mels/027472.pt|that is good that is good because who wants to be the idiot still talking about
mels/031932.pt|work kind of making fun of it to be honest and as we're getting close and this i didn't really know i
mels/015403.pt|in chance in this war they were kind of on the way out to be quite honest um and
mels/031492.pt|in starcraft are unlike any other game
mels/019471.pt|i guess i i was trying
mels/031440.pt|i wouldn't trace the ball to about here
mels/026185.pt|thank god for scientists always pushing things forward in ways that we really do need
mels/025849.pt|let's say five to seven years influencers and creators have drastically changed the
mels/010895.pt|hashtag minion sweep and by the sister company of factor hello fresh
mels/020959.pt|you know what you were right about this too
mels/025615.pt|what the counter it out the fail is
mels/018113.pt|it's like it's an artist that work it's mastery
mels/003837.pt|at the end of the day i would say a lot of americans actually find both teams to be not aligned with what they want and
mels/020998.pt|it wasn't just funny for this for the sake of being let random the
mels/024351.pt|that was pretty good let's see if this one matches up this is a guinness ad called
mels/023265.pt|how she really can taste the difference in waters
mels/003164.pt|it's hot new buzzword the metaverse was very exciting and they changed their entire company name but it turns out it's
mels/002718.pt|but you said you wanted to push it
mels/028287.pt|he's a psycho but he's a great guy but
mels/004647.pt|sorry to bother you only just
mels/012934.pt|actually if you look at it nowadays social media is like the most important social media and influencers are like by
mels/018640.pt|wait a little bit more every game company now has to include in their budget if they're smart money for twitch and youtube influencers they have to they have to spend money on on these things if you're going to make your game big you got to spend money on
mels/004369.pt|saw a bunch of funny photos
mels/014431.pt|we're going to get bigger and it's going to be a major way we consume content for the next five six years and
mels/008441.pt|ooh thank you for the one year a firm handshake and a firmer salute you said hey big a thanks for the great
mels/016072.pt|because i don't even know what that means
mels/012851.pt|yeah i'd be on cbg academy or
mels/030564.pt|is that you kissing her it doesn't even look like you that's me
mels/021710.pt|will need to be amputated it might not
mels/017497.pt|just in game design somebody made a version of doom where instead of fighting demons you just screenshot
mels/009003.pt|so it's kind of it was an
mels/001198.pt|i've done cup ramen as well but i feel
mels/023220.pt|i literally my food pyramid if i were to draw it let me
mels/013340.pt|and then i put them because they wouldn't fit in
mels/003659.pt|it again it's my classic dr pepper mr
mels/008101.pt|thank you very much man feels
mels/029204.pt|it was crazy twitch needed the ads like twitch needed that that many viewers watching ads is huge for twitch wouldn't he have gotten donuts or subs
mels/022259.pt|why make some of you cry even harder for different reasons
mels/031790.pt|it's other minecraft viewers you can see how
mels/030062.pt|in april okay so i was six turning seven but i was six years old i read the nintendo power and i realized that hey you pikachu is
mels/022975.pt|one big obviously but they're not they're nowhere near the the
mels/009842.pt|it's only in europe where that's even
mels/022099.pt|in response applebee's fired the server so right in the middle
mels/019714.pt|don't need to do something about student debt that's the fail okay because i saw this
mels/001662.pt|well yeah i want to know that
mels/005759.pt|it's impressive to be honest he
mels/016993.pt|pretty easy read and it's uh it's funny it's
mels/026921.pt|would have been a little odd right to include a scene in the middle of a
mels/017993.pt|with oh yeah for sure he actually bought the studio as far as
mels/005243.pt|i want to tell this story with a little
mels/004565.pt|are you gonna watch the boys today i am gonna
mels/011210.pt|i big j with the tie-dye
mels/022520.pt|opera now it actually looks kind of good mcdonald's is much better at this
mels/007570.pt|you know i might watch it on stream
mels/027659.pt|are filled with political fighting you know which is like usually
mels/020038.pt|with doubleclick is in case you're like
mels/006272.pt|but i must have missed his reaction
mels/008342.pt|literally don't miss i'm literally on
mels/014426.pt|for writing racist rants it's facebook okay uh once you get a certain amount of
mels/026616.pt|at the two billion minecraft remember that
mels/024905.pt|do you feel like you earned is is a very strong
mels/015706.pt|and i'm going to use them for myself i'm
mels/027381.pt|is full i'd say well over half of
mels/007212.pt|if you want to do it and he's like hell yeah
mels/016692.pt|the first released the first people that made the simplest apps like fruit ninja made
mels/019971.pt|and he was ceo of pixar crazy
mels/025431.pt|did i miss anything also an hrough
mels/021861.pt|like for example even it's something as simple as as your
mels/024349.pt|rep now wait are they aviva
mels/000426.pt|it would deal the cards i would win 600
mels/003713.pt|it's basically abusing their monopoly power on selling online
mels/021559.pt|mean like i've said it's a complete crap shoot nobody knows what lengths they will go to they could
mels/007506.pt|if the mushrooms not like 10 mushrooms i'm talking about
mels/006412.pt|and this one this also ties into crypto startups
mels/023307.pt|just smart and so many people think of how dream
mels/027012.pt|people have their money just sitting around doing nothing that's bad they shouldn't do that they're getting crushed by inflation well i feel for him they're
mels/016392.pt|in office and i think this has been a huge problem in the past two administrations to be honest because there was a major pvp loan like
mels/005344.pt|of their seats i think the show's doing its
mels/016930.pt|of course sponsor sponsor sponsor and
mels/006022.pt|you know that's already an advantage even if he was less good but if he's actually
mels/030516.pt|it's point she's like cringing for me you know she's like
mels/013696.pt|we're really going to get something good i
mels/005944.pt|it was definitely salty so he
mels/023183.pt|if you really like my content
mels/027950.pt|back to the wins and fails but big win to
mels/018740.pt|apple but it did very poorly based on projections and everyone was asking why and all the analysts were saying like oh it's because china is losing
mels/027799.pt|were expensive or they raise interest rates and
mels/030163.pt|so he throws his keyboard out he goes upstairs to nipper's computer
mels/026620.pt|the billion all cash deal there are only like four companies on earth that have
mels/003870.pt|i think there's a chance he gets primary i hope so i think if biden runs
mels/011729.pt|the ones in the blue shirts are like they do all the work they like carry bags and like serve dinner and like
mels/015317.pt|to amazon prime content is not a business on its own it's something you use to help your toilet paper
mels/016043.pt|real ones remember real ones no i did a family stream back
mels/023692.pt|and the fourth option is my super sustainable bmw that's the fourth option and i guess they just assumed that everyone would pick my super sustainable
mels/028083.pt|want to watch it it only has like 5 000
mels/007564.pt|the theme for this but because australians cannot just take a roast
mels/023567.pt|if they can get the blue line up to
mels/026645.pt|creates a very daunting task for anyone to go up against let's let's talk about why let's talk about why they did it number one blizzard was historically cheap basically as the stock began to
mels/031139.pt|it was when he said he
mels/018863.pt|team but also very good well I mean yes right
mels/023510.pt|this is number of dealerships for every
mels/032317.pt|data 11 hours worth of attempts i
mels/025205.pt|last week's marketing monday which is about gotcha games and the tricks they use
mels/021943.pt|i'm gonna talk about some bad things
mels/004403.pt|triumvirate you know financially we're both deeply involved
mels/020228.pt|i first went out from sos
mels/020897.pt|i was saying we're 10 years away from vr being
mels/030669.pt|what's got to get a question right we have to go home i pull up the sign lake
mels/000551.pt|the story i remembered the four times and i was like thinking man this that would be
mels/024738.pt|costs sixty dollars this person bought i
mels/031422.pt|this dog is not ours we brought our i brought
mels/023673.pt|hit him with the real and
mels/025710.pt|i hated it i thought the ending was so bad you could you had a perfect opportunity to like make
mels/011532.pt|just picture of ludwig it's his place thing
mels/016867.pt|it's really it's something you can't even predict
mels/030562.pt|so eventually he had to tell her eventually like whenever they were alone he brought it up and assumed she'd already been told that she had not
mels/018416.pt|free your mind at the one place for
mels/021311.pt|it has a gigantic cast a network behind it and a team of ad sales all of that
mels/024385.pt|what we didn't like it they actually built new york city for that
mels/028321.pt|on take your son to work day or take your child
mels/021483.pt|but the thing is these short sellers the contracts they have all had the stock at like
mels/023322.pt|and if you don't want to hear me that's fine but the numbers will out over time you have a safe moon story
mels/020862.pt|is not the next tech hub
mels/018772.pt|okay it's just it's just too smart not to the elder scrolls six announcement
mels/011282.pt|i quiet when i when i yes
mels/012120.pt|and everyone's happy and uh and and
mels/003935.pt|he took a big chunk of votes it was the biggest a
mels/022419.pt|what the concept of like don't talk about blah blah blah our
mels/018203.pt|and i remember seeing it and thinking it was very obvious this is a bmw guy
mels/026129.pt|passive ceo ever finally he quit today and as someone who owns a lot of
mels/027865.pt|well the company the problem is even graycomb in
mels/025575.pt|was that i've never ever gotten a prediction wrong and that is what makes me a genius
mels/031200.pt|and it was really one of my core techniques of speed running by the way the stream title was
mels/013180.pt|there is literally no way that dozens of you from antarctica that obviously which
mels/021804.pt|i'm just gonna go buy a
mels/013115.pt|in one week okay i'm hustling i'm grinding
mels/004897.pt|i started asking like okay what's going on why do you keep buying more shares
mels/013785.pt|nobody made this game here's the new
mels/031457.pt|there's literally that when we walk back
mels/002181.pt|legitimately was very very very it was just like dude
mels/004962.pt|i mean he's been incredibly stupid and that's not the only thing going on
mels/023883.pt|rising up and killing us all that's more of a meme i'm worried about you know if if they get this complex once this gets cheaper
mels/017101.pt|i will be interested only because how did
mels/007440.pt|it's like there's just there's there's too many in circulation i
mels/025778.pt|into the role after realizing she was only hired as a gesture of tokenism to have a
mels/002082.pt|i know your hands and you show it to them
mels/013983.pt|in salesman but nothing he said actually made sense if you look into it it was buzzwords and flair so
mels/014987.pt|i have to say who any of these guys could be a winner
mels/008297.pt|stop girl you listening to coffee cow while you grind
mels/005435.pt|plenty lives happens talking to youtubers um
mels/012536.pt|scream when i murdered that droid because you know what's funny
mels/023256.pt|well maybe it was time to
mels/017808.pt|all the different stuff that people interact with the brand across the thing and you can learn about how to make how
mels/010064.pt|through any traditional method of learning but through consuming youtube content they are able to get a little bit of a drip of new knowledge into their brain and so we have developed get smarter
mels/007430.pt|if you want to cover that up with an
mels/028975.pt|just thinking about what am i
mels/004391.pt|i got this dm just during the
mels/015552.pt|that's it there's no real reason to own title
mels/018195.pt|a car company and two you know how to pronounce it
mels/015809.pt|if you're not growing you're sort of
mels/032396.pt|it totally look at this move oh my god
mels/010632.pt|the show you but you know i should
mels/021506.pt|lot of you just think it's a rich guy with hedges a hedge fund is that it is a rich guy with
mels/015951.pt|what if you watch it a bunch every day and you
mels/003192.pt|but it's a big l from where i'm standing uh
mels/032119.pt|i'm not the worst player at this venue
mels/008787.pt|for a company he doesn't want to buy
mels/023540.pt|we're and then uber spends that money
mels/006798.pt|he didn't have my comforting text
mels/031179.pt|but now the the platform wars are
mels/002117.pt|it might see the biggest number of third-party
mels/018636.pt|they flopped hard so that that was a weakness in their armor because the most popular games of tomorrow are still going to be determined by influencers on twitch and youtube that's gotten more and more important and microsoft doesn't own them and can
mels/008514.pt|got a little shaky and went down
mels/003394.pt|if the the game are you trying to get friendly with
mels/027994.pt|crunched i'm sure still buggy launch and
mels/027359.pt|with the related for from software i think the brand essence is that
mels/011453.pt|if not worse you can relate there might be a common ground here i just read an interesting article about
mels/021325.pt|the predictions i want to say for this last part
mels/014013.pt|is selling like one tenth of everything else
mels/017922.pt|at the top of your feed
mels/016267.pt|injured a bunch but just one so yeah i just
mels/013337.pt|it was a marketing monday example that involved a lot of oreos of different flavors and sizes and so i
mels/025568.pt|the can kill at night or in the day it can kill at night or in the day they
mels/021952.pt|most businesses would say no that's
mels/025736.pt|it's the concept the problem is most of the time when i hear someone say this one's actually a pretty good commercial it's a commercial that has nothing to
mels/018573.pt|the gate both sides realize that it sucks
mels/002972.pt|things down around it that's very minor so i'm watching the whole movie i'm very invested i actually i
mels/024060.pt|and again i'm not saying none of them were stupid enough to think that they could go legit but the ones that were launched only fans
mels/009216.pt|rts multiplayer is terrible for new players because it's very hard it's very difficult and there's nobody to blame but yourself when you lose so it's kind of like
mels/028650.pt|as inside they're like looking at me
mels/000352.pt|wait killer queen game is that what
mels/004152.pt|think elden ring to play so it really is a
mels/016047.pt|already this week but we're just out until next
mels/016480.pt|a 30 year old wall street
mels/007210.pt|as the truth of it so we get to genesis and i
mels/028632.pt|literally two weeks my work suffered
mels/004478.pt|and the problem you think me getting double
mels/011939.pt|we're going to be staying for the whole cruise so survivors fan out and they start
mels/011237.pt|we're in the background i understand it i get it i
mels/002388.pt|that we're gonna wake up at 6
mels/008415.pt|we are just stealing each other's
mels/021610.pt|stellar rise above the rest revealing the
mels/026634.pt|that's also not a joke so let me show you this this is what we showed okay
mels/031051.pt|where he got his money he bought
mels/020811.pt|we'll heroes of society the marketers yes i wasted time raising
mels/018200.pt|secondly it has one simple thing they won car of the year everyone
mels/000955.pt|it's smarter earlier in the week usually if you're like me you start out each week kind of intelligent and then as the week goes on all your brain cells die it's kind of like the birth life cycle of a cicada or something you know it's like
mels/007153.pt|it's not like a place that i generally
mels/000354.pt|it's like it's like two back-to-back things and you can put five people on each side and we have enough to fill up the whole
mels/021542.pt|which means amazon tests are going down
mels/008802.pt|when i looked into it and it's like the banks cannot withdraw at whim they they have agreed to give the money if the deal goes through
mels/015680.pt|next year so all the discovery stuff
mels/010523.pt|pretty cooking up cooking it up getting that
mels/022602.pt|and that's how you dry off you don't
mels/014704.pt|or or like a really fancy dress you know whatever
mels/024643.pt|almost any other way and so every part of china was doing this and it created what was called
mels/015716.pt|feels like it's authentic and and i don't feel like i have to
mels/006756.pt|well the funny thing to watch i've made plenty of videos roasting it and enjoying it
mels/006534.pt|because they thought it was a nice thing to do the reason they're doing it is because they know a good percent of people overspend some percent of them will not be able to pay back immediately and they'll get fat margins on the interest it's it's it's they're not looking out for the little guy here it's just obvious you just think about
mels/016458.pt|they cut it out wayne wayne i
mels/023972.pt|a new free app separate from only fans that is completely free of adult content okay a separate only fans tv app it's
mels/021662.pt|i'm gonna tell you why this that was good
mels/022434.pt|we're going to hip and funny and and witty and they didn't have to go too much in detail on why the mac was
mels/015045.pt|got more expensive which means it
mels/023169.pt|you know we all be a little more authentic on social
mels/026396.pt|we're just marketing that makes you feel more part of the apple ecosystem once you buy an apple product you get access to the blue
mels/014014.pt|so you know we live and learn on that one i which means i will be wearing probably eight to ten sigma tanks at once layered to the gym which will be cool i think
mels/010349.pt|i should have two computers that's actually five head i should play two at once it's lyric
mels/031320.pt|if someone had told me what was going on right away maybe i could have salvaged it maybe but nobody even told me and i mean i'm like
mels/016587.pt|exponentially increasing and they want to save that money so here's an example this is a browser called island it's basically just chrome and yet it's worth
mels/006255.pt|all day stream tomorrow let's go no not all day tomorrow but friday saturday sunday is the
mels/027483.pt|bottom of it and explain what it means for twitter how it came to be and sort of what's what's gonna happen next
mels/003233.pt|grindy pokemon game for the fun of it and and still spend money though still
mels/022563.pt|a subtle reminder the green glove treatment that you've been waiting for
mels/021223.pt|and you can have peacock regular
mels/000518.pt|the group cause we have that big group of ten just
mels/002333.pt|the years ago yeah yeah you
mels/016053.pt|i have a company that matches anything take it obviously that's free money
mels/003786.pt|yeah that's their strategy so of course
mels/000848.pt|war of a bachelor monday i
mels/017060.pt|stay stay here say in the beginning when
mels/023145.pt|do our our bodies it needs to look good
mels/007713.pt|in mexico with ari's extended family
mels/005153.pt|we were after mogul money live
mels/020518.pt|they were fantastic they are very good at marketing and if the
mels/008396.pt|i legal document in front of a
mels/008482.pt|i didn't respond to that so
mels/013580.pt|i have to keep in touch with these things i
mels/031702.pt|instantly know every anime in the world tough is
mels/032025.pt|most of my good friend bobby scar i didn't
mels/003411.pt|wait things china is putting a pretty
mels/026755.pt|these are the largest remaining targets all of these are smaller than activision blizzard which means they are all financially on the table
mels/032216.pt|if the three hours and then go all in at the end of the night
mels/022330.pt|and because it was a new idea because it was so creative they got a ton of press coverage yeah it was genius when i was
mels/019231.pt|the teenagers are that dumb dude anyway turns out
mels/026441.pt|an impact on the sales he sells more subs than most people if you want to get more
mels/017570.pt|and stronger than anyone else's so this is where the yep clock model comes in please give me your yep clocks okay and this divides
mels/002081.pt|state your hands and you could say oh it's i got i got a i got the
mels/030284.pt|you know i just don't know the area well enough i'm not going to be able to get
mels/000215.pt|i i have a sam adams and then everyone else at
mels/010991.pt|it sure you are the group to our minions
mels/017013.pt|i haven't seen it i'll watch it literally
mels/018803.pt|it's very average next add oh
mels/015413.pt|word of how they could get you they could
mels/019501.pt|if you ever wondered why you know like um you'll be watching a
mels/016140.pt|it was pretty good yeah that's
mels/017882.pt|do you think one part of the
mels/015623.pt|well shows but they're not they're not growing okay and they don't have any new
mels/010061.pt|as i might even get an intro made for smart
mels/019776.pt|is because the game itself is not bad watchdog is not a terrible game
mels/005804.pt|i still felt weird about it ever since listen i'll be honest
mels/018568.pt|it's nobody's just flopping out of the gate
mels/000224.pt|it have to call the lady back and order another one which is a is an
mels/009947.pt|it's you guys are not you guys don't like nuance
mels/015946.pt|well that it and they've been so slow but now
mels/025086.pt|to go to university phoenix often feel
mels/002956.pt|we're watching it but no one's it's just not taking over the
mels/008808.pt|is the billion if if you know if the banks explode and you can't get the money or whatever
mels/019866.pt|wow killer type beat and it was a buggy empty mess but this is not only this is not only the matrix online maybe you heard of
mels/017543.pt|three trillion dollars and i want to give you a second to visualize what exactly a three trillion dollar valuation in
mels/024104.pt|well consider it so um this past week the cmo
mels/006922.pt|one reason i was wearing this nice shirt and i was like
mels/028392.pt|so far from our true north here
mels/022802.pt|let me set the stage it took place again at the height of the
mels/025296.pt|watch the show you want and then cancel but with netflix people consider netflix to be like just like electricity water netflix you just have to have it either you have somebody's password or you buy
mels/008963.pt|the termination fee quote unquote is if something happens
mels/004381.pt|everyone every single person here myself included isn't aware that you just cut
mels/031066.pt|which had been acquired by amazon and i just
mels/027902.pt|finding a great deal it's hard with how
mels/000808.pt|i just keep tossing it in i'd lose all right
mels/011870.pt|it talks to you but it like asks
mels/005661.pt|because she was like totally yeah i thought for a league player she'd be
mels/026021.pt|he slams the front of his head as hard as he can against the table as he realizes how much he's being charged
mels/009859.pt|you know it's like you get to
mels/019051.pt|it would be my honor for you guys to meet
mels/012583.pt|was clicking gaming this every bit of down

mels/007074.pt|eight months right so i'm just you know you gotta take the
mels/031444.pt|really pick up and you can see we're
mels/026827.pt|every single ad top to bottom from
mels/013700.pt|fail for twitter shareholders including myself i'm bummed i thought
mels/015962.pt|for a company that to make a stupid sounding name because they want to keep their branding consistent
mels/011644.pt|no it's like it's only two days and it's out a little over five thousand dollars so for two people
mels/003398.pt|i think there was just too many positive ones um is there anything at all
mels/002627.pt|perhaps it is opposite day perhaps perhaps and this is a big perhaps
mels/025838.pt|made the timothy olyphant hitman had never even seen the game bro the way he acts and
mels/021044.pt|it's cringe dude anyway but hey
mels/000671.pt|and this happened again and again and again and again and again and again and
mels/011991.pt|who on the crew or who
mels/014963.pt|easy way to keep track of it is with lily bank i can just swipe
mels/015837.pt|have cable in general is like

mels/012928.pt|and people to see whatever your marketing
mels/003482.pt|the that ring up that dog is gonna

mels/025990.pt|you know we're going to kick of the new
mels/026498.pt|years now there hasn't been a single scam a single rug

mels/025295.pt|which is a hodgepodge netflix is the one streamer out of all of these that has relatively low churn which is where some people in general consider netflix to be a bill something you have to pay it's not a choice people consider other streamers
mels/023486.pt|that's what they're going for get great deals on

mels/007843.pt|it's more of a work shirt
mels/032399.pt|it was it was required basically he said to get past this

mels/021501.pt|but they can't wait that's why the timing is
mels/012735.pt|it all the company might just take your extra labor and pat you on the head but when you work extra hard
mels/027822.pt|people during this fall are spending more than they ever have on buying stocks this is already risky this is a
mels/016144.pt|currently suffering through computer science homework
mels/021757.pt|all i want to do is say hey
mels/025091.pt|we'll say we hate ea and then buy
mels/004084.pt|like i'm trying to spell it
mels/022400.pt|by being consistent over many years they get way more value than trying to to farm one ad for a little extra
mels/017367.pt|for toddlers is actually really important because alexa will try to test them and kill them if they're not ready first thing you
mels/014427.pt|will snowball that can't be stopped because you use it because your friends use it
mels/006099.pt|and it'll give you the handshake so cody obviously intercepted
mels/008020.pt|like the the real freedom of breath of

mels/005483.pt|it's forward with a grin on her face
mels/028462.pt|while in germany so this kid has been like shipped off from somewhere in america
mels/005392.pt|the front pretend we didn't say that if i think speaking that out loud is like speaking of devil's curse
mels/017167.pt|but before we jump to that i need you guys to do what i love that you do and that is
mels/016952.pt|and up using my code in the link

mels/005705.pt|but we actually got to talk
mels/031676.pt|and then by the end of it i'm like fully
mels/026094.pt|the people seeing drinking have a ruinous impact on their parents was a major response people saw drinking have an impact on their parents and they didn't
mels/021593.pt|with diamond hands never let it go
mels/024544.pt|help people that like you can't even hint at it you can't
mels/003857.pt|it right now this is this is gonna explode like no
mels/020403.pt|mr and he has to be here in the freezing cold at a gas station somebody's
mels/011611.pt|i don't know what i'm talking about today
mels/002957.pt|with the conversation which is like wow so it's not a great look for their first big pivot into into the new style of
mels/027368.pt|it tells me they understand it so he said we're always looking to improve but in our game specifically hardship is what gives meaning to the experience so it's not something we're willing to abandon at the moment it is our identity and i think when you think about that
mels/004891.pt|in their perspective okay so flashback four months not three but four a month before
mels/001729.pt|a cruise ship wide pool on how fast the ship will arrive at set port
mels/008681.pt|get the whole thing thrown out but if they're a real company and they just have slightly more or less
mels/028088.pt|it fails he presses the wrong button because there's too many you know it's complicated then he brings up the
mels/024649.pt|doing great we're doing great we're
mels/024833.pt|up one thing they never ever want is for you to be like okay i finally got it there's no amount of money that can get you perfection in this game and there's
mels/027064.pt|i know commercial of the night i hope it's a winner
mels/004645.pt|immediately after i get this text
mels/004997.pt|to a free billion dollars cash can help i mean it's not a bad thing it's a quick cash infusion it's probably about as much
mels/009368.pt|of damage there taking out the misfortune could be a very good
mels/004596.pt|and so i can get on the other one but i'm sure it's only going to last a few
mels/027786.pt|it was essentially free to borrow and so everybody was borrowing money to run businesses that didn't make that much money and to invest in those businesses and that can go for a long time until inflation starts to get out
mels/028044.pt|get as long as they can get their message out stronger than like the counter argument they can scare enough employees away from ratifying union contracts
mels/003723.pt|from the government finally and basically antitrust to like look into this and amazon is realizing that if they keep going with private label
mels/031113.pt|it was the spark but really it was all the time me and him played portal together for when he had
mels/009619.pt|it's going on mr beast has ludwig's
mels/008650.pt|rarely has to deal with money amounts this big the
mels/027407.pt|for the vast majority of americans how much they owe in taxes it's already reported by their employer the irs has a number in
mels/021905.pt|it up really late again and
mels/015635.pt|as long as nathan stands wants to scam the world by watching survivor episodes live on twitch openly
mels/010306.pt|because what if he doesn't want
mels/016838.pt|especially as we continue to destroy the planet we're currently on jeff bezos will pay you to find him a
mels/030002.pt|with the lifetime of your stream and then in the

mels/023350.pt|at frisbee throw it's insane so
mels/000550.pt|it literally because i remembered this
mels/005807.pt|at all i wanted to do was
mels/014492.pt|and really there was no way to get around it
mels/014668.pt|new dictionary and then you said zero percent
mels/025581.pt|in my friends through the first few months of the pandemic that's awesome if you enjoyed that mark i think you'll be excited that we're partnering with vertigo on five more great games from deep silver and others we'll share more

mels/002710.pt|off the table immediately and you could lose
mels/029170.pt|with their backup plan of a lapras and as a result there were tens of thousands playing at the same time so coordinating movement was pretty much impossible that's huge by the way
mels/020765.pt|yo what's up what's up guys yo
mels/019672.pt|the autozone one what made you do
mels/004431.pt|and then people are talking about millions every stream it's like that is the coolest so i wanna say keep it up keep and then people are talking about minions every stream it's like
mels/024909.pt|and and i'll explain that real quick it's basically the thinking that you are more likely to hit a roll because you didn't
mels/023900.pt|he did it when he was like 13 years old
mels/015352.pt|i have the money to pay their way out of

mels/031703.pt|yeah i gotta tell you i can't say i have
mels/022049.pt|and every brand has tried to do it we've gotten a little more jaded we've gotten a little bit more like wow this is super cringe and you're just
mels/026143.pt|kept making accounts kept getting banned
mels/005905.pt|but still it was a big deal it was a big deal

mels/012593.pt|so i and they've they've fallen a lot
mels/004285.pt|mixing i think you guys listened to my
mels/012604.pt|but anyway that you know what i'll tell
mels/008615.pt|we bought it you know you wouldn't give a
mels/023442.pt|in my own words and and with you know my own examples and stuff but it is essentially their stuff and if any of you become marketing professionals be

mels/015558.pt|well they'll allow the losses for too much longer
mels/004528.pt|of all people in the space at all i think i'm one of
mels/017778.pt|you get your sub red he remembers your
mels/017193.pt|a little scared i was a little

mels/025297.pt|by it it is like a thing that is a requirement to doing business and that mental switch has been huge for netflix because they just don't lose customers they they they mostly just
mels/014826.pt|well only a few days later we got this article so many ubisoft employees have quit
mels/026529.pt|where can i buy one what is your open
mels/008499.pt|at the end of the day it's a legal document but it is interesting

mels/013873.pt|that was an amazing show it's a genius business idea it was very forward looking and it's paying massive that it was an amazing show it's a genius business idea
mels/027602.pt|anyway so that that's happening and will likely happen he's
mels/014415.pt|gotta crack if they crack these problems twitch stays on top if they don't i
mels/017841.pt|i have focused more on this riot games is not particularly better at advertising league of legends than anyone else but purchase and post purchase
mels/022644.pt|if the forums and twitch and reddit but
mels/030435.pt|with that that i got engaged
mels/007023.pt|well made he got the z trigger i mean everything's
mels/008254.pt|we can talk about you know all stuff

mels/021743.pt|we're not going to stop it we're not going to
mels/018532.pt|on a company that will help your competitor okay that's not why you do it
mels/021763.pt|it's just like it's so sad it's sad to just go back to the past to try and make a quick buck and the takeaway is not that i want to eat local with ubereats i mean the food never even
mels/020097.pt|at the time and he starts a company called next a company that was going to compete with apple and make computers the problem was like most things steve jobs does this

mels/027808.pt|tens hundreds of billions of dollars and they weren't even making money so to avoid that the government had a brilliant solution we're
mels/006489.pt|spending up a storm on credit
mels/012792.pt|it's the guy that was happy he would keep the

mels/003254.pt|yes this is what i want every single possible hobby should be
mels/022262.pt|as he was disqualified immediately for
mels/014718.pt|yeah you got a link i want to watch
mels/013083.pt|king and then smoke with us
mels/007435.pt|dude if i had any uh you know you
mels/021638.pt|with the satisfying crunch i i like
mels/025140.pt|and this guy said hey truck you
mels/010179.pt|but please don't let twitch see
mels/028957.pt|so at one point it was winter break or something and
mels/008443.pt|thank you i appreciate that i i i know that i've spent most of the season just drinking the capri suns eating the orange slices and not doing anything but i don't need i don't need
mels/007709.pt|actually genius yes that makes so much sense
mels/008566.pt|actually specifically are not saying any hard numbers they're just saying i'm trying to figure out what's the exact phrase they're using it's it's a very funny phrase because if they say
mels/006930.pt|well as i just don't shower and of those three options the last two i usually wear a hat
mels/018846.pt|if voted this of 5 it is very weird even you know
mels/014036.pt|and i will say this with all sincerity almost every streamer that i know in every group across twitch whether
mels/009499.pt|because we were champion yasuo god's favorite champion yasuo got his favorite
mels/014032.pt|i want to say this in a in a rare moment of sincerity ludwig is a big streamer obviously but bigger streamers have signed deals it's not necessarily just about the numbers that they picked up they picked up a guy getting 15 to
mels/029844.pt|wait it was us for right when we all
mels/009121.pt|and then you just start getting so many more
mels/025201.pt|it's the tailspin it's a negative
mels/030348.pt|san francisco later and we sort of
mels/020210.pt|have it published on the website then vote on the best one and it will become an official item on
mels/032101.pt|the that to be a punchline
mels/015970.pt|netflix did not make money until probably this this year i want you guys
mels/001026.pt|is this one's kind of cute if this is your dog it's a cute dog
mels/009174.pt|your brain craves those dopamine hits of one
mels/020392.pt|i would of course yeah i would kill the parents that would have that yep there we go
mels/013239.pt|it's bigger book of mid i've heard mixed reviews but
mels/006936.pt|yes yes yes yes indeed yes okay right
mels/026508.pt|universally in that in that binary
mels/014677.pt|it's a bigger marketing money than usual okay
mels/021372.pt|i'm going to give you this stock
mels/026618.pt|if the biggest cash acquisition of the 2020s so
mels/032376.pt|it was so much harder so i made a reply
mels/000348.pt|we were at a barcade for
mels/017710.pt|okay so them investing in the purchase and post-purchase areas of the clock have generated outsized rewards
mels/017403.pt|if the image you go to google images and unfortunately when they went to google images and
mels/005884.pt|subtly there's unique differences and it was i think
mels/029906.pt|one talking head talking about how i
mels/022338.pt|and one cool thing about this campaign you know if you're if you're wondering what's going on and a brand tells you
mels/005728.pt|i get back in time but i really wanted to see i wish i i
mels/018826.pt|it's a safe target right because even
mels/024209.pt|when people that only watch minecraft creators and other minecraft
mels/029720.pt|in the clutch up and he's gonna he's
mels/024904.pt|if you like you did some work they will give you a randomized reward based on some amount of effort like let's say you plant a crop and then it grows and then you get something special any kind of
mels/022002.pt|in this that i see in a lot of marketing
mels/026105.pt|it's a corporation resonated quite far and
mels/018450.pt|what the games for windows i mean they
mels/014434.pt|a lot of the climate right now is clumps
mels/003402.pt|what it feels like it just it's not going to be
mels/008846.pt|if he's got that maybe but he has shown no evidence that
mels/022837.pt|the vietnam war and the iraq and afghanistan wars it's one of the biggest disasters that have occurred to our country i lost 80 percent of my worth
mels/031306.pt|but we're there for like 15-20
mels/011248.pt|i was really thinking about it for a minute but i
mels/031933.pt|told him to to delay she said basically drive in circles like just go around around like 10 blocks just
mels/029628.pt|yeah you know directorial decisions you see
mels/004767.pt|people started to think wait a minute you know let's look at the numbers here
mels/028413.pt|i wasn't in the military no my father was and i grew up in on
mels/014187.pt|and so youtube has made a pretty smart investment here with not only getting this solid group but also getting ludwig
mels/023891.pt|mango winning crazy storyline tons of
mels/021792.pt|but more serene this is a good
mels/027467.pt|everyone is asking me if i was kissing
mels/009605.pt|yasuo all in the mid lane
mels/013459.pt|was married his wife and then begged her for money every single day
mels/025501.pt|sorry you're breaking up it's not he
mels/004623.pt|whole portfolio so i can copy and
mels/018825.pt|very basic like hahaha vegetarians I mean
mels/032394.pt|what are you talking to myself kind of slick with it
mels/019632.pt|i texted him earlier he gave me his actual number i want to see what the story was so i'm
mels/030584.pt|we're cool all right if you'd like to join my kahoot the pin is i'm gonna say it
mels/005119.pt|it was like i just forgot about it and it was up
mels/014796.pt|with the quiz questions related to if this might be relevant to you
mels/020801.pt|that leaves only one award remaining one final award and for this final award for the grand finale i couldn't be the one to read it we got a special guest ludwig
mels/029864.pt|hours and he wouldn't let you leave
mels/026507.pt|story to tell you can hate or you can create what'll it be and the internet chose hate
mels/008305.pt|so i'm gonna call my my boss fish
mels/023997.pt|this is where they were stupid the backlash is immediate and immense
mels/019858.pt|the first part of this is the matrix online this game came out
mels/022643.pt|if you're like me you love talking about
mels/023732.pt|solves everything i actually use headphones for for me that's what makes me happy in an
mels/002555.pt|person in a scam sweatshop is on the other end of
mels/020586.pt|deus ex gamer i love this game there's a lot to like the stories are really fun
mels/023586.pt|i think it's a good framework and
mels/004032.pt|probably not hit hear me out
mels/018959.pt|what are you doing you're browsing your
mels/031652.pt|it properly and so my arm gets tired and he
mels/015167.pt|what i'm saying is it worked so they spent 28
mels/027957.pt|it is it fair to say that this will be the
mels/011736.pt|you're taking a cruise into space so the first thing i
mels/031006.pt|he was pretty he was like you know kind of frustrated and then christmas happened and i
mels/028455.pt|i was reading i was reading a book uh maybe
mels/018609.pt|that being said it's still very likely this game
mels/017816.pt|not a this is not something i don't use i think it's pretty important and i
mels/001489.pt|well let me think here what is something that
mels/029468.pt|so i leave and i remember like feeling super down i remember like that was probably one of my worst days in california when i moved
mels/024366.pt|it's expensive ad ever made and it's not
mels/015068.pt|we didn't didn't know the value
mels/004888.pt|and the reason i believe that on the other side of the deal is that twitter is basically
mels/025866.pt|get outlook is what it is later in
mels/025288.pt|among us was bigger than squid game okay
mels/018132.pt|exhausted people are collapsing because they can't refresh themselves
mels/027170.pt|an insane amount of money just
mels/028004.pt|seem a little bit worse for the xbox side combo that with a dub on the sony side which just announced their new ps plus lineup
mels/002895.pt|it's something i'll be updating on week after week but that's
mels/025439.pt|he salutes his own digital character who
mels/016466.pt|get into the main wayne pink rats his
mels/026759.pt|it's will look like to try and take down
mels/006752.pt|watching your stream maybe like a week ago
mels/011042.pt|dating someone new and there's a lot it
mels/014988.pt|but there's one guaranteed loser there is one guarantee loser no it's not
mels/023577.pt|they were essentially giving you free movie tickets for 10 bucks a month you
mels/010858.pt|i think of themselves as yasuo i do agree with
mels/024596.pt|because i have three wins that are kind of small and one fail that is very very very very very very large first
mels/019072.pt|look at this and i didn't think this was weird or creepy because i love the show so the end of the day i can't be too hypocritical no look it's all weird line right
mels/015796.pt|you can get it bundled with disney plus
mels/021211.pt|these are going to decline none of these have the breadth of content and the rate of new content to uh to keep subscribers in the era of
mels/008591.pt|so twitter match was basically forcing
mels/004672.pt|has taught us okay so in that sense i have seen it throughout my entire life in another sense no i haven't and
mels/020441.pt|i agree monday this is a fun one
mels/019381.pt|that i would use and we kept
mels/023939.pt|the the question do your mama know you
mels/020910.pt|no i don't it's luck this is still luck i wasn't a genius it says people g pick a random stock
mels/031979.pt|dude i actually think there's this guy that that that gets our sense of humor at a very deep level that i'm going to reach out to we're going to hire him
mels/003914.pt|people are saying hillary might run again might get a hillary trump rematch

mels/022246.pt|see we got here another thai commercial i
mels/002985.pt|while the plot no it's not there's more left
mels/017749.pt|many car companies will run ads just to prevent buyers remorse from
mels/018331.pt|essentially so everyone can cash out on idiots on
mels/029371.pt|i the win him over i've made him laugh
mels/000918.pt|my friend let's get my negotiating
mels/021133.pt|we genius but i think it's actually just cringe and it looks like the votes agree cringe taco john's yes we'll do another submission from ari she wants to talk about taco john's from
mels/027881.pt|in the building your own business for cheap and
mels/004094.pt|i think it's about time i got deeply into becoming
mels/010325.pt|is that when i ask you for help you take it seriously you don't just turn it into one big goof and i appreciate that you don't just
mels/032402.pt|it was essential as i thought dodging i literally don't think i
mels/014782.pt|if you're a freelancer of any sort then this
mels/002820.pt|and of course love me some musk danielle
mels/027214.pt|it on pace to be bigger than all these by far and on the contrary games that have adopted more traditional methods of being quote unquote triple a are in fact struggling horizon forbidden west which has the terrible distinction of launching their first game around
mels/021322.pt|built a among us competitor okay they paid someone to make it they own it and they stream it they all stream it
mels/031970.pt|it's the next level by inviting slime's
mels/001608.pt|get smarter thursdays where we're going
mels/017807.pt|or stuff here you could put you know
mels/007817.pt|is the shirtless picture and so i'll do that tomorrow we'll do targeting
mels/024030.pt|they need to keep paying out the 90
mels/014498.pt|i'm not i'm not taking you out in the alley and
mels/009503.pt|he's here he's ready to go
mels/006529.pt|girl interest but that the fine print tells a
mels/019957.pt|if the lion king did mulan they did hercules they did
mels/031387.pt|if the from this guy drinking out of a bidet
mels/021097.pt|a punch like at all at all like not even like the
mels/015103.pt|it's almost a dead company in 2011.
mels/030119.pt|he's like mad that we bought this like it clearly seems
mels/027986.pt|at the movies and film there
mels/000099.pt|i see it will be a blessed it'll be it'll be a
mels/010871.pt|it would be cool to make a new account
mels/030188.pt|hundred bucks on it and the thing was climbing up that rope is already hard but if somebody next to you doesn't want you to
mels/012064.pt|you know whether or not it was
mels/014543.pt|do you think it's possible for someone like otto to get a job at i didn't see
mels/008467.pt|i but you're not my longest sub it's certainly
mels/019913.pt|in the most famous gaming ads of all time it's
mels/007826.pt|the the magnifying glasses stare deeply at the
mels/027009.pt|which means i am not in the target market because i thought it was terrible so i'm
mels/014607.pt|can't comment on how much more they are paying him but they are paying him money and generally not for his contract
mels/014902.pt|and art of animal crossing at least this time it feels like they're
mels/003647.pt|capitalism is the competition from innovation and the only way that works
mels/017424.pt|i can their parents and they didn't want it to
mels/017130.pt|little do you know i'm still haunted by the
mels/009892.pt|it's been very very popular for billionaires to have
mels/009321.pt|watch people that went there and she went there anime expo
mels/011182.pt|if you're like regularly going on hikes
mels/030828.pt|water bottle and you thought no but in
mels/030640.pt|is there like the largest river in russia is lake
mels/015159.pt|the telecom companies were suing netflix because they didn't expect to have to actually deliver unlimited broadband to their customers everyone was watching
mels/027807.pt|we're making a solid profit whether you had a solid fundamental business model as long as you're growing and so that's why companies like peloton and zoom
mels/029446.pt|the boss is like no no i
mels/004366.pt|out today and my initial first thought was like okay
mels/015633.pt|same as peacock but probably worse but they have one key difference they have one thing that makes them able to weather any storm and that my
mels/020407.pt|i like sneak off to the back so the way i think
mels/014189.pt|i was about where we are now let's talk about where we are now in those streaming
mels/023994.pt|starting october 1st okay and that's
mels/005218.pt|but no he didn't do that he didn't
mels/017889.pt|where you can do things like influencers and social and stuff like that in the pre-purchase area but i think building a
mels/003054.pt|well i did it was netflix crackdown on password
mels/028157.pt|it goes through there is no shot it's worth a billion dollars even at their crazy outlandish numbers even if using their extreme expectations it's still
mels/015732.pt|on this i've done this this is apparently
mels/021799.pt|america we were getting so divided as a nation i was thinking
mels/029508.pt|i thought was actually a really
mels/003419.pt|the united states is trying to bring up taiwan's profile and legitimacy with
mels/020560.pt|would have been to release the pc version now because you get best bug feedback from
mels/022277.pt|i don't this one says the irish road safety ad is so
mels/013303.pt|do i know you in a business or professional context and then when you have the answer to
mels/006407.pt|yeah it's basically a total disaster
mels/011730.pt|you know whatever everyone is in character every single one i can retain
mels/005362.pt|i must be i must be missing because he's
mels/002403.pt|you know what i'm saying east coasters just different dude i can't
mels/003757.pt|now it's like if you don't do it you're
mels/026605.pt|the new series warped premieres jen
mels/021681.pt|it's like a certain character we can't legally name from the office
mels/012568.pt|is under my real name it's under
mels/016456.pt|you to participation people are generally getting paid more wages are going up i'm not sure applebee's will thrive in this environment but the fact that he sees inflation and rising gas prices
mels/020468.pt|well when i took a look at the sales figures so i look at those and i found out that
mels/006885.pt|it was like the peak of like but it
mels/018389.pt|that is the truth for every business i'm trying to expand this a little bit so you guys
mels/014594.pt|we're going to be good they just want to grow uh
mels/010980.pt|to sort of experience it is you watch
mels/000534.pt|the grand seiko four seasons this last time we were in vegas we were all drunk and we were last time we were doing well we were like here's our plan we're going to run it up at the casino
mels/031677.pt|why league like they converted me in that event and
mels/032022.pt|is an etsy rewards card give it up for
mels/027077.pt|into the year pretty mid a few standouts but
mels/003656.pt|running grandchildren of wealthy families generational wealth is the
mels/007695.pt|i first started dating her than i do now
mels/013806.pt|many moons ago when microsoft bought bethesda it was right here there is no replacement
mels/032081.pt|and i hope your petition to bring back
mels/019118.pt|stock and we can see who's really
mels/008942.pt|as an excuse to sell tesla shares i think that gives too much credit because it doesn't make sense to sign the deal at that point you can talk about the deal and then sell the shares like you're
mels/027212.pt|it actually was a massive success dark souls 2 even better dark souls
mels/026625.pt|i had no this was not a mirror because 70 billion dollars
mels/026932.pt|she did well it's a super competitive
mels/000253.pt|because his girlfriend is the one who loves
mels/023867.pt|thanks this is perfect for hard to reach places perfect for candles grills and so much more that
mels/006490.pt|people actually put a lot of money into savings all that money is now gone savings are dried up people have
mels/025058.pt|could be nestle and i think primarily it's because globally they are major
mels/004254.pt|it is unfortunate i mean there's so much
mels/021340.pt|you could look into your heart and find it in it to subscribe by clicking
mels/001471.pt|but i probably would have taken merkel
mels/014047.pt|and stats and how much this might hurt them in the short term and realizing it wouldn't hurt that much in the short
mels/013965.pt|offer almost they offer no protections so on a credit card you have chargebacks you have you have
mels/018721.pt|they can afford to lose everything on this console to make it back by becoming the netflix of gaming sony
mels/029160.pt|i would i would like sieve through the
mels/026425.pt|how does he do that what is different about him he doesn't have you know he doesn't chill for primes every every minute like
mels/017073.pt|so the youtube is on hiatus temporarily
mels/009379.pt|nobody's doing and he's doing and he's dead in
mels/018384.pt|i think that snapchat officially offered that's good marketing direct good direct marketing the
mels/026923.pt|i think it's pretty mid but i also know that it was more memorable than the average bear
mels/029348.pt|it's were some of the the studio
mels/010354.pt|are you went to school with lyric
mels/010809.pt|get the background like that would be it would be funny it would be an
mels/007125.pt|the the get it so i i wore mine but i can understand if
mels/019831.pt|was to dig deep shut up and work on their game and so for that i can't i think it would be boring for this list to put him at the top that's
mels/015196.pt|and so netflix is doubling down the strategy of building and talent all over the world and the exporting great shows from and so netflix is doubling down on the strategy of building um talent all over
mels/023417.pt|so you must have cheated and uh we all
mels/019006.pt|she's only been around for a month or two i mean
mels/024918.pt|so i kind of mix those two together here but
mels/024766.pt|the be ready for number one a bonus for first time
mels/005151.pt|in my life and i didn't know what it was like and i didn't see how much value this business would bring and
mels/030630.pt|all grades and i was like i
mels/015777.pt|what that more in future marketing
mels/022352.pt|ingredient the kind you could read
mels/003427.pt|the the situation it's it's the most dangerous thing we could possibly think of it's like so hopefully all all goes well and nothing happens and then we continue the status quo of it being like um
mels/028613.pt|the story behind a shirt yes
mels/028842.pt|in one of these rooms they called the
mels/018046.pt|it should have been a coke can
mels/013110.pt|funniest tweets of the year so far literally gut busting laughter i
mels/005882.pt|i want to be a guy who goes to dinner and then says things that were at the dinner i'm just trying to be that was just funny
mels/019437.pt|the brand the company launched the nation's first
mels/007265.pt|i got photos of it all right we're back
mels/017086.pt|with the cringe tweet luckily i like taffo
mels/021076.pt|so who's the target market for condoms
mels/027496.pt|four billion dollars he's buying the company about
mels/000401.pt|are weighing the most heavy i
mels/002908.pt|week trial period after which it will just ban your account
mels/025964.pt|if the company not only are you losing people
mels/014816.pt|okay that's what i'm talking about this
mels/010412.pt|but at least you have some ability to switch
mels/025622.pt|as a piece of branded property
mels/019926.pt|the for number one most important
mels/004114.pt|just the the gh in general
mels/002656.pt|girl is that what i'm seeing
mels/000816.pt|in shadow legends let's talk about
mels/008037.pt|and they are all big it is it is it is like
mels/030533.pt|would not get her mom alone one time
mels/007670.pt|the only time they're silent is when i actually
mels/001126.pt|one but the ones i've been seeing are more like it's like it'll just be a group of random people in a discord and then every video is like
mels/016214.pt|there's nothing i can do with that
mels/022769.pt|and buy dallas mavericks and he's never
mels/027171.pt|the print some kind of absurd amount on top of this and that would only further cause the problem
mels/001284.pt|the apprentice and then donald trump became president and joe rogan became like the biggest
mels/031168.pt|i not say but at the end of the day at that scale at that size you can't
mels/009164.pt|ten before it that's what it means
mels/011745.pt|what i was referencing they just i think they put the default which is
mels/015822.pt|i want to answer these questions my friend made his marketing
mels/000971.pt|start of the hangover okay if it ends up beating the
mels/032422.pt|ready for extra hits in phase two if you're

mels/026661.pt|what's an animal that like is

mels/013552.pt|what my chat okay that's good
mels/016756.pt|and so people that have solutions and
mels/013525.pt|it's tough enough as it is
mels/020427.pt|that's what i'm talking about though that's why i have been so unimpressed with pepsi's marketing because this is this is their whole strategy as of the past few years actually for the longest time you see
mels/002946.pt|i like a little bit more
mels/000484.pt|and i stare at the alarm clock and it is
mels/032133.pt|weekend though i will say in the great war between me the player and my enemy the casino a battle was lost this weekend the
mels/022700.pt|i had to hit that goal if you wonder why
mels/028379.pt|if the project you can't say i'm busy
mels/006310.pt|and youtube sided with him that's
mels/011504.pt|instead of buying a script bought like a high school
mels/028169.pt|a whopping 3 million dollars in salary per
mels/030836.pt|somebody my co-workers know too much
mels/003874.pt|and run it back but four years older
mels/027695.pt|look at who runs America okay here's the
mels/010592.pt|and we sing the same song with the same power we can be bigger than these struggles
mels/012546.pt|it was a cool idea the idea was cool and i could see it being if
mels/013685.pt|you could possibly imagine if you guys don't
mels/016125.pt|i have a lot of stuff planned for the new
mels/008189.pt|was the minion stuff contractual bro that's gotta be one of the dumbest
mels/028645.pt|i feel amazing okay now that's that's
mels/006864.pt|at the beginning like ordering and i was like what should i get us you know it's like people were like good chicken the whole
mels/012638.pt|the on me and your bad attitude towards all things that's not that's not my fault
mels/023043.pt|this is illegal this is a monopoly
mels/008796.pt|this is very unlikely i think a the world's richest man going to jail is unlikely come on what country
mels/016941.pt|into small percent return which is a way more
mels/002881.pt|in order to reduce the amount of money he has to pay
mels/006580.pt|what i'm saying it's like it's like a last sweep
mels/006725.pt|for sure just churning out the
mels/008545.pt|if the thing for it he loses between
mels/021440.pt|despite what it seems like in the
mels/008978.pt|i wanted to have all the people that were there when i bought it it's not a strong argument i'm just saying it's the
mels/011217.pt|i don't know what he's doing i'm down
mels/029786.pt|you know one of the cool things for me getting into the scene around
mels/019565.pt|it doesn't say anything about the brand it just says liberty over and over and over
mels/009945.pt|if the was be slightly self-aware
mels/002358.pt|it's to rsvp i'll take the steak thanks you
mels/012596.pt|tell you what i'm doing i'm just putting a little
mels/022457.pt|lot of people that worked on this thing but the
mels/007246.pt|worry about it good luck dude we're
mels/021244.pt|with the gaming okay the amount of money that gaming makes dwarfs all other forms of media so let's make a
mels/005901.pt|actual he made me say this obviously obviously i wouldn't say this
mels/019999.pt|as you can understand sports aka
mels/000133.pt|co-sponsors at this point you know
mels/012808.pt|guest who was our worst player on team

mels/027938.pt|i mean it's easy to use it's got a great interface it has easy access information
mels/006365.pt|at based on the math of rolling for it
mels/021263.pt|flex factor so with all that combined
mels/010735.pt|thank god oh thank the heavens
mels/002271.pt|i would have named him ford okay
mels/027703.pt|follow my account on there you can follow other influencers and

mels/011189.pt|i thought you were like 23.
mels/026469.pt|i love for amd dude amd is
mels/014561.pt|if the a lot of pausing on youtube is huge i
mels/000217.pt|fancy whiskey with like muddled cherry
mels/017016.pt|okay everyone knows that good marketing requires a
mels/004621.pt|to expect a certain level of revenue and profit
mels/019066.pt|find me on my twitter at
mels/012569.pt|and so i when i log on and check it it's
mels/000571.pt|the show in vegas go to like carrot top or something and like it'll
mels/018104.pt|not stop i will not rest i will not get weary okay i am a man on a mission a gamer on a mission and i will not stop until
mels/007983.pt|i feel like in my mind i've explained it a lot
mels/029123.pt|at the community you see this fossil is an item with absolutely no use or function until so i i'm the one that jumped into the
mels/011240.pt|in the contest for most crowns don't talk about don't bring this up
mels/028594.pt|i was stoked there's scarra at
mels/021899.pt|of an actual flywheel so the first one is one that i'm constantly struggling with and that is to sleep on time to work out
mels/030902.pt|i think we played when we were at your house
mels/004225.pt|i guess and i'm glad they did it but
mels/000883.pt|what you want in this entire world you could
mels/026562.pt|watch cinematic universe i assume that this is all part of a plan to make an absolute dummy amount of money but if he actually
mels/006161.pt|much appreciated just yeah i think the ghost really
mels/018616.pt|when netflix first started okay netflix was dvd by mail delivery service and when they started streaming it was all other people's content okay they had friends they had the office they had
mels/000526.pt|and we open the wide doors and we're walking in and we hear the
mels/000600.pt|crashing around people are flying off it's crazy that happens it wakes me
mels/029057.pt|and he gets in his car and he drives away and that that moment i realized he was
mels/028492.pt|so i just got this private off oh my god so now i want the private to stay so i
mels/010403.pt|walk over their customers and now you get great speeds at a low price in chattanooga
mels/017503.pt|it's just get this is good this is good games
mels/024388.pt|mr costume production person this did not premiere to the
mels/016167.pt|the the guy i'm actually a little bit
mels/014395.pt|yeah i think i think auto and i'm still making it still important
mels/013695.pt|so i don't know i thought
mels/026314.pt|the product volume the amount of product of
mels/007784.pt|but when we see it we'll see it
mels/017481.pt|your own life have a chance to support these
mels/021477.pt|it's just everyone betting that the meme will get bigger and they can sell which is a ponzi scheme
mels/016272.pt|in a losing graphic which is uh wow that's crazy how they
mels/024541.pt|so for example like if you want to subscribe on twit like if you want to
mels/027611.pt|it might be both for some it might be both more
mels/017378.pt|is just marvel movies thank god these people finally got a
mels/009741.pt|it was actually a really fun movie but the plot is so ridiculous it's set in like
mels/006818.pt|so if you're trying to binge the
mels/011355.pt|i'm just saying the one thing i agree with
mels/025968.pt|they told me this when i'm applying there even after all of this after all
mels/022591.pt|i would be like off the charts controls your game character and with the waterproof earphones you
mels/028936.pt|also the way the the way the bathroom i couldn't throw up in the toilet is what yeah like he had gotten me a also the way the the way the bathrooms were i couldn't throw up in the toilet

mels/023965.pt|it's like second and i think it's been the big
mels/020942.pt|is often the best choice there is too many people drag
mels/020754.pt|later this year a lawsuit filed by over
mels/010867.pt|wait a minute if i ever play league again which i hope to not right
mels/028686.pt|and if you like this content content
mels/028323.pt|little mini wheat is there with his
mels/026500.pt|smooth sailing all the way through and it makes me makes me happy
mels/007192.pt|intel tell when i saw jmuk's
mels/019706.pt|and then also they got him to do songs internally which means that's that's
mels/001028.pt|like they just found out about it there's like a hyundai plant where they're just processing sheet metal with like 12 and
mels/003255.pt|this is what i've been hoping for every single thing i do should be turned into a
mels/025658.pt|but obviously the real one is not so the market cap is
mels/000376.pt|so i get down i get down
mels/006566.pt|so sony's building space lasers and you know i know they're
mels/004872.pt|it's jobs are moving towards more remote friendly options
mels/018714.pt|on getting them signed up for

mels/027765.pt|unfortunately every one of those seven
mels/023074.pt|but with food all i have is a
mels/014245.pt|was this and ludwig is one of the best ways
mels/027134.pt|it's borrow from this and then loan the money out to you basically interest rates are the cost of borrowing money that's it and the government can set it by how much
mels/020069.pt|as are all right every time you guessed it for all
mels/004155.pt|however you never played undertale again therefore
mels/005454.pt|yeah target goes hard dude target goes
mels/002171.pt|yeah always have a tight five ready it shows strength of character
mels/027661.pt|it's basically people pay for a check mark
mels/010342.pt|in the process is an unbegun
mels/001934.pt|i think i could do either one of them
mels/011836.pt|the actors so you know my bar was low and when i got on the ship for the first time i was impressed because i'm walking around and the other this is the key thing the other humans haven't shown up yet
mels/020037.pt|with the originally and that is google's acquisition of
mels/006451.pt|of brilliance by beating a level 128
mels/020100.pt|usually you're acquiring them for the product but sometimes if they have talent you really want the people you really want like really talented engineers or product people it's called and aqua higher or basically you're hiring that you're buying the company just to usually you're acquiring them for the product but sometimes if they have talent you really want the people you really want like really talented engineers or product people it's called an aqua hire where basically you're hiring
mels/008797.pt|could the banks withdraw their financing
mels/017883.pt|fuck is more important than the

mels/028959.pt|they went home they were all gone everyone goes home for the winter except for me and a couple

mels/003711.pt|it's like you have to sell on amazon and then they find out what sells based on
mels/014977.pt|we're going to approach the war and now they're
mels/010279.pt|you are very playful is the thing wow

mels/026329.pt|apple shifted it down here they
mels/031285.pt|the skywalk and he realizes he
mels/024472.pt|pick up on what's going on in the first few seconds okay and we've already coded this ad in our brain as
mels/026406.pt|if the worse and less advertisements than
mels/001995.pt|and i got a heat stroke well that's not
mels/003864.pt|as this and like getting his point across but they just can't get on message he doesn't he just doesn't look
mels/005855.pt|we are trying to raise fifty thousand
mels/004100.pt|you know what i'm saying strong like bull

mels/004452.pt|i sub can drink shouldn't but it can
mels/009221.pt|well it's i'm not gonna read your message because
mels/029032.pt|what split off and me and him were in
mels/023159.pt|the first tricks marketers will do is it's drastically undercooked that's how they keep it plump so once
mels/025229.pt|diamond in league of legends and no one
mels/005140.pt|in the first of all i'm gonna play
mels/020642.pt|yeah yeah you guys know how it is you know
mels/021103.pt|towards smiley face and i agree simple you know what i like what i

mels/001616.pt|in this whole summer have been from factor meals
mels/001448.pt|is the game over yeah the game sucked
mels/028855.pt|i woke up the next day i don't remember
mels/023097.pt|things to try and create a picture in our minds and that is what marketers take advantage of
mels/004074.pt|with the great message that's like
mels/023848.pt|in delroy and his um his new album back to the
mels/005250.pt|it's totally fine and i look at him and i
mels/012309.pt|thing because that bar room has

mels/013100.pt|this guy got ranked 11th and then
mels/027989.pt|which is worried that the game will become the next cyberpunk so to avoid that
mels/003662.pt|after pepper and it's great and everyone loves it and then one

mels/023484.pt|ads and that is why they are the official truck of the nfl they spend about
mels/025330.pt|who decided to quit that's the origin story for
mels/028345.pt|and just gets raw forward smashed he was
mels/022675.pt|oh those trade deals memes trade offer you receive

mels/018127.pt|pepsi for pizza what i can't fathom including this
mels/017693.pt|is of martin luther king and john lynn
mels/011784.pt|like what is this going to be
mels/021217.pt|if the backlog they might be in trouble they have
mels/008624.pt|if the team and i don't like elon musk so there's a good chance that both of them
mels/001580.pt|if you're still peppa i can hear you
mels/019240.pt|outside imagine that now dude imagine that now with
mels/001626.pt|all the fun stuff i don't know what i should name it or title it daddy needed a new map that's not a good name that's not going to work the new hitman map is insane

mels/002564.pt|yeah that goes for him flip it damn i hate to see that i hate to see it
mels/013502.pt|and everyone else that's also true you know what maybe they should do that you know maybe there's some positive in this i think often a lot of aggression towards other people comes from a lot of negative
mels/000433.pt|to the other dealers he's like these
mels/026327.pt|we're talking about spending your money when i
mels/012228.pt|of me thinks about it he looks at me thinks about it he looks at me he
mels/017873.pt|more their focus is that other brand stuff
mels/013756.pt|the the most dominant companies in gaming ever
mels/011738.pt|because it says their name it'll say like it'll say like um you know mark and then
mels/020935.pt|is your passion later so getting rich quick isn't possible
mels/022844.pt|lost in a single quarter the highest loss in business history everyone involved lost money tons
mels/008586.pt|if you spit shine this car clean
mels/023162.pt|basically nearly raw but if it's if it's raw how does it look grilled how do they get these grill lines like look at those beautiful sultry grill lines god damn you know like sheesh you
mels/026141.pt|could also be a dangerous precedent but i'm going to give him a dub for this
mels/025270.pt|in that is to the the chuckle over at netflix i'm sick of netflix forcing me to watch whatever their flavor of the month
mels/010546.pt|okay well there's the okay there's the cutie from league of legends that i know okay there's the there's the league of legends coming out and
mels/024119.pt|well america hooked on the mobility adventure of hyundai the unfortunate part is it hasn't really taken off to a great
mels/006305.pt|nine and then we go right
mels/006565.pt|damn spammers i'm doing marketing monday jesus christ dude
mels/028122.pt|i have a company public especially one that's not
mels/026164.pt|ever since they first heard about diablo mobile they've been saying we have phones blizzard why don't you never know
mels/015842.pt|maybe but would you watch it there seems unlikely you have to build a brand for it people go to twitch to watch
mels/019466.pt|i have to say this but everyone in chat saying she's very hot and sex sells i don't think
mels/004191.pt|the choice that i've made but i've decided
mels/032352.pt|the challenge the modding community in
mels/015982.pt|was just trying to do that's what
mels/003464.pt|and with that i now officially end the
mels/003889.pt|in slam the thing and say dirty to
mels/014791.pt|as a sponsor especially for marketing monday um if you want
mels/006162.pt|the only thing is oh well whenever i
mels/006177.pt|he stole my trademark on the in-run logo
mels/005098.pt|that's not what i wanted to do
mels/010043.pt|do you understand what i'm talking about
mels/029419.pt|and i send it to him and then like three
mels/001202.pt|well every day as an adult also the thing about lunchables is i when i was a kid i really liked lunchables until one day i had a piece of ham that was so slimy that even as a just like a
mels/020385.pt|being marketed till you feel like you're in on
mels/020948.pt|i don't think your dog's that cute
mels/029875.pt|it's not much in love you were with me
mels/032242.pt|so i i withdraw more money we sit down at the table and we're placing hundreds of dollars on player and it works for the first round and then this is true this old
mels/025600.pt|and his company in charge of our social interaction big win for humans
mels/026748.pt|because people don't necessarily follow this stuff why
mels/024267.pt|there were like wait a minute this is kind of boring what if we just have him sing
mels/024304.pt|proud of this whoever made this whatever agency made this should feel like
mels/015701.pt|if you are a freelancer or a side hustler you almost assuredly
mels/009291.pt|what's the everything so it's very difficult to escape them and then
mels/016231.pt|it is crazy that we just found a 12 view
mels/009971.pt|i get my playlist on ironically i'm gonna end
mels/022420.pt|in the better at or we have 13 more
mels/017482.pt|whether through awareness support through any of these
mels/005845.pt|so really funny clip and but i i referenced it as a joke to
mels/017938.pt|and then get your cut of the nfl
mels/025900.pt|everyone clapped that you finally went
mels/009542.pt|so he has the legal right to say my team
mels/022444.pt|the android ones green has caused people to not switch it's crazy and it seems small but it's been so effective and it's like these tiny details matter to how the people that use your products see
mels/027488.pt|if you like it or not immediately becomes something that like determines your political party instantly i'm
mels/021732.pt|at my only point of contention it didn't do a good job of of
mels/021349.pt|because you bought in a thousand at peak
mels/022394.pt|is phenomenal and i think about
mels/005007.pt|if the price and pretty much has to
mels/002604.pt|god damn it roll it newbie guy heads or tails and we're getting near the end of this segment actually we're actually a little over
mels/028808.pt|she was pitying me she was like oh
mels/007214.pt|care how much this costs this
mels/026884.pt|incredibly rushed i understand that every second is hundreds of thousands of dollars when you're buying seven million dollars for
mels/020247.pt|samsung why do you pay ryan reynolds to be in your ad why hot canadian sex sells he has the voice of
mels/001531.pt|fair so i need to open up it okay um okay
mels/016206.pt|what do to research being immortal god willing god willing a world without jeff i don't even want to stomach it skip the middle
mels/019826.pt|the lying that's what they did but in the interim sense if you've ever watched
mels/028008.pt|when microsoft and sony the real winner will be the gamers both sides are getting better both sides are getting better games pc gamers are winning most of all because they both have
mels/001267.pt|part one look at the iconic
mels/012342.pt|like a margarita kind of thing this is pretty
mels/004636.pt|if he didn't even say nvidia right he was like in in
mels/016757.pt|is just open up to immigration you know this is a pure
mels/026116.pt|so i was actually really impressed with the
mels/022076.pt|try to be funny because generally the first lens we look at when we see a post is who it came from you can see the exact same post from two different people will get different amounts of
mels/026913.pt|want to put it easily in the uh pretty
mels/026206.pt|that he set up on a stand next to an open trash bin burning fire
mels/020013.pt|they should just buy the internet
mels/007990.pt|why do you go live so light or why did you say white if you asked why i go live so late that's one thing if you said why did you go live so late today i go live this time or later every
mels/022483.pt|you know they're just they're funny and they're creative
mels/021433.pt|it makes money and they did not think of the customers as their boss they thought of citadel as
mels/011314.pt|yeah and i didn't stay on campus
mels/029481.pt|worry i think full with a lot of up and downs
mels/005823.pt|so mad i thought he was like a really
mels/008538.pt|that he had to do it but the scale was
mels/001168.pt|and they emailed me to say i was
mels/027775.pt|good thing to say but you know how for like over a year now i've been talking about how like everything's in a bubble and then like now it's all popping it's all happening now
mels/021727.pt|actually happened here this is a very interesting situation the ad was terrible let's move it down
mels/031110.pt|he's been hustling he got better and
mels/018139.pt|oh my god there's a cop car on fire in a
mels/026793.pt|advertisers generally are looking for a high high net worth or
mels/017675.pt|and it's noticeable right it is a noticeable difference now microsoft in
mels/019353.pt|or six it's a disaster you are scored based on
mels/016230.pt|it's crazy how hard that goes the whole
mels/025522.pt|the xbox and nintendo and i'm sticking to it i think they've uh withstood some of
mels/015213.pt|we globally with two languages peacock
mels/007618.pt|not even go live and the gifties
mels/020565.pt|best buy and they buy the physical copy and they put
mels/029135.pt|will deliver the punishment you cannot hide before dig rat what they would do is spam start go to the item menu and click on use helix fossil and then oak would say
mels/002282.pt|put you in jail even better for your career yeah exactly
mels/029712.pt|i get a little bit like oh i'm kind of nice
mels/030797.pt|i can just tell it only
mels/026114.pt|what concessions for the employees uh
mels/015544.pt|is that they go to apple world because it's good
mels/028267.pt|most no no no no no someone in chat said she was
mels/028265.pt|that's what you get she she was like please please do not hire this person please i will give you even more references but this person is absolutely miserable if you hire
mels/024390.pt|and apparently this short cost almost as much as the
mels/025115.pt|you know what i think it is because nestle's
mels/018651.pt|at the acquired that's where discord is right now i bet you get discord for about one to two
mels/031455.pt|his head and we lost it
mels/024824.pt|a huge discount on something you know basically what
mels/007267.pt|i said more of the story where did i cut out i forgot
mels/007765.pt|never happened before but i'm literally
mels/016612.pt|if you want to check it out i think i have a pretty nuanced take on that i
mels/014740.pt|like that i'll be honest with you
mels/026770.pt|if the privacy for a while now apple did a whole privacy push
mels/029517.pt|i think the overall narrative of this this whole doc is like how the five gods came to be how they fell what you know like
mels/030319.pt|was like he had traveled he's like
mels/019197.pt|oh by the way uh can
mels/026693.pt|and so they come back and like
mels/017377.pt|one from a small share to now they are literally
mels/011393.pt|i didn't buy the five thousand
mels/005095.pt|i actually i'm not sure that i have but
mels/021944.pt|it found in this book but i'm gonna tell you the last good thing i found and this is another thing that i use in my life generally
mels/029408.pt|nervous and like this needs to be quick i was like mom no
mels/017250.pt|always of investors money without actually
mels/004046.pt|woke up early for a meeting and i was doing work and then i worked i just feel like
mels/027038.pt|it's like right up his alley and the concept of
mels/001761.pt|point of the tim burton remake seems to be that it would do what the video is
mels/028857.pt|read around like putting things somewhere i just put it all back on
mels/006839.pt|it was uh i didn't get to see a lot
mels/003811.pt|the way they reacted to people even protesting on the supreme court
mels/030295.pt|if the only messages like old
mels/010616.pt|at the lyric collab everyone's been asking for
mels/028273.pt|worked there he had been fired thank god because i go
mels/018680.pt|worldwide over two to one microsoft got their ass kicked i
mels/005106.pt|i have a twenty five months you lori on for the 25 months
mels/015668.pt|they clearly are cut above everybody else in the world that making movies
mels/022883.pt|what they can even hear me
mels/012830.pt|for lud now it's so crazy but this
mels/023739.pt|it is literally like half the cost for
mels/000402.pt|fucking amazing we have this plan where we're
mels/016101.pt|am i what am i what's happening here so in conclusion is
mels/024147.pt|in a half there's been a bit of a lull where
mels/020929.pt|as much more fulfilling getting good at something makes you passionate about that thing and also gives you that center that reduces anxiety so that's that's my advice on that and
mels/012663.pt|did he told me to play it
mels/023305.pt|coke zero sugar that's it and then it became not a story
mels/017880.pt|a good thing again okay cool chill chill children that was fun that was a good i felt good okay good good good good good good good uh okay cool chill chill chill that was
mels/005329.pt|you can just watch the four seats
mels/027146.pt|it's basically hot potato and so they've been passing this back and forth and just every time they
mels/001901.pt|know about is that twitch makes way less than youtube for me you know like twitch twitch is like
mels/026942.pt|is the solution all without feeling too rushed
mels/009541.pt|he kill he has even kda
mels/011798.pt|and you get off of that and they
mels/022296.pt|as them and their whole family and sues
mels/025831.pt|only going to experience this on crack after
mels/024130.pt|thank you so much for dining with us today ma'am would you like any hot sauce on your tacos you would here you go
mels/025949.pt|for your team to be featured next to
mels/027934.pt|if a job can at least know that he shares in their pain and is also down financially after spending
mels/009949.pt|these are good and bully more
mels/009403.pt|if they left the last two picks for the last part of the draft
mels/028295.pt|and it'd be like yes we do and thank you for asking that and then ben would ask him and say hey
mels/007106.pt|meet him out of interest to a large amount of interest to a large amount of
mels/004977.pt|and i only found this with
mels/009721.pt|i they don't even say that just thinking about that is horrendous ah ah
mels/016014.pt|no one wants to lose money no one wants
mels/028899.pt|the diego told me was that about let's say
mels/009749.pt|anyway that will be stupid enough but then while john travolta is anyway that would be stupid enough but then
mels/022300.pt|damn who mega lol him dude
mels/021159.pt|so though it made it's more of a smiley
mels/015759.pt|most competitive so the american market is where everyone's fighting for except for netflix but it means everything's expensive and it's really hard to make any gains american consumers are pretty good about playing multiple services off each other
mels/026042.pt|hey above minimum wage they pay i think 15
mels/018458.pt|i don't think i know him so i googled him he's a roblox youtuber
mels/024402.pt|this one on video games i
mels/021981.pt|to get her to say these lines like amazon is great and to get slightly personal here which i don't usually want to do on stream my father who works 30 years in the military
mels/013665.pt|it can't stand on its own feet mixer didn't get you
mels/022934.pt|working with playstation and we want this to be
mels/016473.pt|trends that are changing the world right now okay let's start off by talking about everybody's favorite
mels/029243.pt|no delay ah fans fans and as he's walking out
mels/006232.pt|i just figured out that i like watching
mels/030413.pt|my dog shampoo it just kept my hair
mels/017370.pt|the somebody who really needs it though can i just give a win for a second to someone who's been struggling a group
mels/020927.pt|it's change so what i would say
mels/021017.pt|it was terrible no one liked it if they
mels/000233.pt|everyone's got chips down there and they're rolling dice and if they roll well everybody wins that's the idea except
mels/019485.pt|what the commercials that's a problem now you have
mels/029126.pt|it's a new emo because i was literally there at the
mels/011864.pt|well i mean that part that
mels/002488.pt|pringles are trash on every laze bag
mels/001515.pt|all right i'm having this uh
mels/020371.pt|where i don't think chad is
mels/022312.pt|welcome to marketing monday on a tuesday today's topic my top five ads ever the five ads
mels/021933.pt|so that's the sort of idea people g i make your
mels/022472.pt|if the actual people that skate so they really did their research the
mels/006762.pt|that she sent me during game seven of the
mels/013201.pt|that you can like pull yourself back to reality with
mels/028779.pt|the other odd jobs like really if you added
mels/023002.pt|with the epic is is not innocent because as much as epic talks about this being for the good of everyone and how important it is for small developers that's only the case now after they secretly tried to get a special side deal from apple apple
mels/010509.pt|not all the fans right i mean you
mels/020047.pt|if the that subscribe button it costs you nothing
mels/012378.pt|the a bartender but he was not into it at all
mels/016804.pt|a variety of services they haven't had
mels/002402.pt|the rest of it to me is always a blur
mels/004176.pt|into a special type of marketing monday
mels/030742.pt|all of the above baby all of the above
mels/017186.pt|i hated it i was so sad i was in such a bad place
mels/019061.pt|yeah but maybe like a burger will cheer me up well like
mels/027129.pt|i just recorded inflation ever it's it's happening like crazy uh now
mels/002252.pt|monday to their dad continues to
mels/013833.pt|who you don't know anyone there you are not a shareholder
mels/016977.pt|we have a little bit of time then i'll
mels/003040.pt|should i steal my amc stock
mels/012884.pt|like they just they raise the prices every year without raising the quality of the education or the or the the
mels/015315.pt|prime because of amazon prime video that's worth it they can throw as much money as they want
mels/009907.pt|don't rely on people being good whenever you rely on better angels if
mels/018780.pt|which sort of dominates all the competition in fact it dominates dare i
mels/022512.pt|the sugar and we you know like
mels/021513.pt|and then take a little cut and instead of investing
mels/028398.pt|my entire life if you write as per my last email you are in corporate america saying i want to fight you you are my open enemy if you write as for my last email you're saying
mels/017474.pt|so i was actually really impressed with that
mels/024488.pt|is to lose and i think in some ways we all work in
mels/004588.pt|what up every time you guys think it's spectrum
mels/014517.pt|actually i got the wrong clip
mels/015361.pt|check out lily bank if that interests you and if you are spamming taxes and you are not eight years old i would be worried because it is coming and you will have to pay it so check them out link
mels/020402.pt|if we can't be with his family on christmas
mels/002468.pt|if they weren't like super fans of lays they
mels/013984.pt|i just wanted you guys to be aware that as my fail of the week is buy now pay
mels/013901.pt|but that's not and you know part of the problem is i
mels/015998.pt|it's all good for consumers while
mels/021884.pt|it's talent agencies in hollywood and it's this woman's
mels/032357.pt|i have no definitive proof you cheated
mels/019360.pt|jason he's like dude we're fine our grade is set
mels/001896.pt|but i currently don't entirely due to laziness
mels/029111.pt|seen before you start and i'm like yeah so before i've even done any work i'm up in tahoe
mels/003943.pt|what the president i mean listen
mels/011460.pt|in good god damn album and
mels/030760.pt|let me tell you i was walking around
mels/008299.pt|i put you in this right spot
mels/029469.pt|i felt like damn this is just not working i
mels/028540.pt|if the person today at the end of day we can help you
mels/000768.pt|it's melee you have to find your champion so anyway i don't know it was just an idea while drunk i wasn't
mels/017312.pt|and uh first of all given the fact they
mels/021058.pt|the ship your pants too i can't wait to ship my
mels/004037.pt|it should be on the vaude channel
mels/006543.pt|things like offer financial services to
mels/013536.pt|during lunch beating the shot of them
mels/015303.pt|it used to be owned by the
mels/030662.pt|she says this he says this lake known for having
mels/025110.pt|most places like you're going to complain
mels/028605.pt|the whole thing was a disaster i quit
mels/015545.pt|they love the iphone they love the the airpods
mels/008516.pt|and i don't think i sold around 45 to 42
mels/028145.pt|on that is not a business worth one billion dollars i know
mels/015287.pt|talk a little bigger hdmx a
mels/027819.pt|the crash so at the point i'm trying to make is that i looked at the data and retail investors which is what you and i are the crash so and the point i'm trying to make is that uh i looked at the data
mels/002905.pt|it is a two to three dollar per month
mels/028669.pt|right after that dude how was i not fired twitch culture in the early days was like so crazy
mels/004459.pt|what would my fast food crossover be probably whoever pays me
mels/014526.pt|competition breeds excellence and that's exactly what's happening here that's not a trump quote
mels/029418.pt|i write up this whole email right this whole big email to this guy like hey was great talking with you
mels/004276.pt|if the marketing monday speaking of marketing monday how about you tag yourself because we're jumping into it
mels/022944.pt|pull their access to it that would be illegal or at least a cause for you know
mels/030704.pt|and only one river flowing out of it that's what i knew about lake baikal so let's finish
mels/025269.pt|the main thing and i'm going
mels/001401.pt|and and if there's one thing
mels/029631.pt|it's going to end on a high note with pp and apex
mels/013259.pt|i don't really do much melee on stream but if it's really funny i'll check it out is that why ludwig
mels/014203.pt|to better mental model think about it like
mels/019071.pt|what i'm saying is i was impressed
mels/023329.pt|if you want to protect your family's interest in earnings for generations if you want your kids your grandkids and
mels/008903.pt|or a working institution we can't have that it makes no sense up yours woke moralists hey if
mels/002246.pt|they do a lot of stunt stuff they do the thing to where they they sent the
mels/016280.pt|there will be no crunch and you know what if i think of anyone in
mels/010453.pt|the over here and then we'll play the looker afterwards
mels/021418.pt|i love billionaires were making tons of money off
mels/023025.pt|big money if epic wins this lawsuit apple says then all these other people will lose money
mels/031488.pt|a sea tier korean he is he is not even
mels/002795.pt|it's casey it's very funny is your mic loose yeah it's
mels/022402.pt|i say savings you can't skip this guy
mels/023005.pt|at it but we're fortnite okay we're the big dogs so you give us a secret deal where we don't pay the
mels/023625.pt|back to the video how likely are you to recommend windows 10 to a friend or
mels/001632.pt|there's a new map and then that is that is
mels/028444.pt|work on my rhymes and play it
mels/010607.pt|and half the battle is you guys not saying things that are so effing stupid that i have to
mels/019554.pt|i would love the story i wonder if i
mels/011788.pt|at the video i think so let me show you what it was i was probably
mels/017340.pt|i would give it a fail because uh a
mels/003788.pt|it's just it's like it's so comical it's
mels/012573.pt|it out and there's like hundreds like six or seven hundred
mels/025766.pt|the harness that for your marketing in a way that doesn't make the audience feel cheated or angry or annoyed or jump scared then you may be able to find a
mels/014901.pt|it's just like them suing a random
mels/011450.pt|but what that means is interesting topics of discussion are limited to one or two days a week
mels/031632.pt|was what i said i don't remember what i said
mels/019838.pt|like the game world is so epically big
mels/017339.pt|that's the scary part that's what's coming but yeah i mean for now it's just an interesting fact i just thought
mels/010688.pt|it's just simple politeness i was asking how you're doing i doesn't you don't
mels/006600.pt|we're looking forward to number three
mels/029137.pt|that was one of the funniest things
mels/005166.pt|well it was all me holding my phone
mels/020009.pt|much money 30 billion dollars is so much
mels/031219.pt|we're like okay he won so in
mels/012440.pt|we like if you're a bad guy you
mels/009551.pt|best players in this whole game
mels/011901.pt|right you don't want that's not what you
mels/018713.pt|well way to get into gamers homes
mels/025165.pt|play the sound because it's copyright he start he made
mels/019070.pt|in character as a depressed alcoholic horse and i lo i thought i mean the the
mels/003008.pt|so we we rush to the exit the second we
mels/011655.pt|crisis i called ludwig and stands and said yo i think this might torpedo the whole world economy i'm selling everything now hey by the way that
mels/004987.pt|i'm not sure what the game plan is
mels/007149.pt|should proclamation yeah what similar struggle right
mels/007626.pt|like no one ever talks about that they always say like quack doesn't know
mels/028100.pt|million dollars in value in a day
mels/023010.pt|so what they did to kick this whole thing off
mels/024942.pt|the games like starcraft games that really were only about skill-based progression now do i think they're gone for good
mels/019444.pt|on the same page while we're voting
mels/013388.pt|and it's way way more convenient
mels/005150.pt|and i said during the broadcast that i'd never had a nail any sort of nail
mels/018120.pt|with your mom and you bought a
mels/004901.pt|the cap it there we cap
mels/029899.pt|and so we get kicked out of the venue we're all super drunk
mels/024431.pt|if the from that angle yeah i believe the angle matters a lot but it's also like
mels/004127.pt|it's there's always one person that might don't be that person
mels/016842.pt|i am trying to do a deeper amount of research into it to sphere figure out
mels/015527.pt|their idea is similar to amazon the apple ecosystem if you're part of the apple ecosystem let's say you're
mels/016013.pt|what the debt and fight netflix and your plan
mels/009113.pt|makes sense doesn't make sense it doesn't add up the story doesn't add up ember kingdom name of the three months youtube frogs shanghai makes sense it doesn't make sense it doesn't add up the story doesn't add up
mels/010886.pt|and then between that they show crypto
mels/022120.pt|interviews with the super bowl story
mels/014164.pt|what like a big cash out event you have to go
mels/029287.pt|the world yo this brings me back so when i was
mels/004373.pt|stuff on twitter all the time because i like all of them
mels/025402.pt|this is the final one i have a bombshell for you everyone's been
mels/029365.pt|of the dinner i talked to that comes at the end but either way i'm at the beginning of the dinner i order my food i think he's
mels/022525.pt|at google we seek to hire the most exceptional people
mels/024454.pt|they've been having declining same store sales and
mels/001898.pt|whatever i have is the minimum so whatever
mels/015636.pt|and customer and as long as
mels/009969.pt|the it but i do think he's he's he's
mels/002205.pt|in the ultimate source of truth uh man facebook is
mels/026678.pt|and pay blizzard for these rights so twitch was like okay how do we make this money back and it was things like this okay watching overwatch
mels/016596.pt|i'm sorry you can't see the number
mels/011113.pt|that doesn't make a lot of sense right but i
mels/026083.pt|somebody had put an image of jake hurwitz from college humor it's just one of the images and because it looks similar enough the people writing just
mels/003222.pt|we're about this game it's uh
mels/017076.pt|it i mean it's you know
mels/022506.pt|i think i think that looks really nasty and
mels/030240.pt|that reminds me of a story actually
mels/028245.pt|but but they were actually like the most
mels/006353.pt|seems to get a win in this country or in this world and that is rich idiots rich idiots have a huge win in the past
mels/001967.pt|it's to make waffles you know i i think i could have fun doing anything you're it's kind of a
mels/031397.pt|amazon i got money from the stream and the youtube
mels/000271.pt|so i drank quite a bit i'm putting i'm
mels/005401.pt|and they were talking about some of the tips from that and he was like thinking about starting a new one with me and point crow and we could like share ideas
mels/014951.pt|for help but if you are like me and
mels/030847.pt|it's a video it was it was in my most recent
mels/031190.pt|i legit think that's where streaming is
mels/015242.pt|the massive spike in churn what happened in
mels/011861.pt|every time you go in there
mels/024111.pt|there's nothing cooler than calling your game the hyundai mobility adventure and let me tell you for all the seven
mels/030594.pt|we're going to your marketing one yeah i'll do a marketing one yeah i'll do a
mels/014231.pt|if the for streamers and so instead of like it being
mels/016704.pt|and then others very long commutes and ways to alleviate or get around this are going to be extremely important people who come up
mels/011613.pt|i had my wedding last thursday and it was a very special day and i had a great time and then i realized i was immediately back to work on monday and it's just the one of the busiest times of year
mels/003034.pt|i just like a weird definitely weird moment and the thing i
mels/009841.pt|all i'm saying is that we need to start living in cities where cars are not required
mels/005796.pt|do people have asked for pictures but like
mels/027714.pt|play on Barbie and she changed it
mels/015868.pt|also just better quality rewind there's a video on
mels/026335.pt|it conveys that they're worth the price tag second thing on the purchase part of the
mels/021152.pt|be safe around trains a message from
mels/014185.pt|if they are not negotiating on
mels/006633.pt|with stands right and lud actually
mels/031698.pt|well later like 20 minutes later start dropping
mels/023718.pt|this is look my only qualm with a lot of
mels/029429.pt|was trying to get me a job at right
mels/017574.pt|we're just this happens while you're buying the item and this
mels/024439.pt|was your eye i think you're
mels/011835.pt|go on so it's pretty empty except for
mels/019575.pt|the instrumental also in one take but on the bridge of the song which originally went you could keep it to yourself
mels/027701.pt|information on your trades to hedge funds
mels/017380.pt|and took in more than i think like the next two combined
mels/005387.pt|nails done then obviously it would be worth it if i could yeah that's that's a
mels/006536.pt|it can see massive multi-billion dollar
mels/020504.pt|in value it's not just the value of the money
mels/002887.pt|no matter who you are he's the
mels/007567.pt|but i did they're like the
mels/014749.pt|bow your head in reverence to one of the greatest songs ever made uh the
mels/025369.pt|was it like scared because at
mels/003376.pt|during the moscow open yeah during the moscow open yeah i think there is a let me find the video
mels/008612.pt|locked and so now you know it's that's that's the whole that's
mels/017812.pt|and that was that was a quick quick and
mels/002443.pt|few months thanks for the dope content king no problem do it for you
mels/025965.pt|people but you can't hire anybody blizzard generally relied on the blizzard
mels/008031.pt|there's so much to do and i
mels/020301.pt|i can't i can't be in this ad i'm jewish let's watch this nintendo
mels/006794.pt|i was like i should text him and
mels/008406.pt|is that you probably don't want to hear you
mels/002408.pt|if the language hold the country
mels/021601.pt|it made more money driving their stock up
mels/017292.pt|this is what the author would have wanted by the way to carry on the legacy
mels/011562.pt|thank you finally someone said it
mels/027868.pt|does that mean it is worth more than every single other car company combined no it doesn't make sense the
mels/023690.pt|the first option is car sharing the second option is e-scooters the third
mels/001982.pt|and they all had different names the reason that was the case was because froyo is a very
mels/025090.pt|the nfl is one of the most hated brands now again it's similar to gamers
mels/029264.pt|one time players could finally take
mels/019555.pt|i get in touch with him and just ask him
mels/024187.pt|to start negotiating a better split and i
mels/025850.pt|the gaming environment and companies that understand
mels/018519.pt|people like adam sandler or production companies
mels/027086.pt|let's just get all that fun stuff out of the way all right we good are we
mels/014567.pt|chunks and it works all weird why is it
mels/015022.pt|plays commercial please play this commercial please
mels/007235.pt|oh no it's not no it's just it's merch it's
mels/007327.pt|so much early but then i i get i punted it all back
mels/004240.pt|i don't get so many comments like that
mels/023929.pt|the content i just say this is funny but what he can do is literally like make
mels/000742.pt|the thanks for planning it we clink our
mels/020732.pt|the year we enter the final four and if you guys are fans of marketing monday awards the mondays then you know
mels/015577.pt|started declining a little bit because everyone
mels/005025.pt|at or for crypto shills okay because right
mels/018832.pt|it's halftime and his team was down and he thinks back to the last game where he had to eat this
mels/021267.pt|heat up heat up for two people twitch and youtube if you look at
mels/006963.pt|i was connected i don't do taxes it's probably a bad thing too probably
mels/011918.pt|the first meal is when i realized
mels/022663.pt|be sure to visit the website down in the description for more news about game changing features and to get notified when ron launches
mels/013369.pt|order them and get some sort of themes we have none of that i'm going
mels/017578.pt|what back to the marketing model of like the 60s of the
mels/006207.pt|the flag okay and that and
mels/004116.pt|and she said i mean she said i said i'm so sorry like if it was anything was
mels/003107.pt|it feels like it either heavily discounts the many negative stories i've heard about working at amazon the fact that i quit working from amazon
mels/028885.pt|when i put the cup to my lips the night is now the rest of it's black everything
mels/005036.pt|and then you get 5 000
mels/018410.pt|really pissed me off the amount of money they spent holy mackerel
mels/022842.pt|time warner cable with aol stock so everyone at
mels/010798.pt|i'll see it for free and we get more memes out of it if it does well it's funny if a meme filled bad sequel to morbius actually outperforms the original that's funny if it flops again that's also funny so i think there's actually no bad world for me as a consumer if we get
mels/002243.pt|people see they post on the goddamn reddit
mels/029000.pt|oh no no he's scrappy dude if there was
mels/009835.pt|has not been close every single year the ford
mels/028661.pt|fake jewel i'm trying to show you what
mels/000176.pt|so here's the truth parts about the
mels/003627.pt|i didn't like it just it just it just makes little financial sense especially if you're like in the same town as your parents to move you know
mels/026355.pt|being perceived as luxury and high end and
mels/021051.pt|and up being one of the funniest ad series of
mels/003491.pt|you know i should probably try to find a way to
mels/010944.pt|drawing delicious meal and eating it on
mels/012879.pt|a good luck good luck good for you
mels/008573.pt|big twitter is not a well-run
mels/025151.pt|tall glasses of ice water oh no this is not a win i'm sorry i call
mels/007528.pt|it's a bit and i went over and again this guy
mels/014754.pt|as a marketing monday topic and we found a fan made autozone jingle from peter scott who was an
mels/011125.pt|i got a perfect solution for that it actually comes
mels/030941.pt|i love with yeah yeah i'm sort of a hardcore fan but i guess
mels/005369.pt|and so i assume that's it i'm like okay so
mels/007964.pt|minus my fee of course after my fee
mels/020656.pt|greater in the ad i'm talking of course about
mels/031524.pt|i got this at this event i was in the i was in the crowd waving this i was like
mels/000317.pt|in a great time on saturday
mels/004760.pt|at the current ceo who he was buying the company from
mels/024074.pt|true design because people aren't eating in the restaurant as much it's basically designed for a future where there's a lot more
mels/018252.pt|this guy's face this is my reaction
mels/027557.pt|i'm trying to keep it simple if uh one
mels/028733.pt|browse for jobs or something and i see a message and it's like from a day ago and it's like yo you've been around we
mels/007434.pt|i really i think it made sense you want to be absolutely in your element for your first big top eight uh and i think yeah he did
mels/031990.pt|you guys know blur from losing
mels/010778.pt|sign up for the private military for six months of free prime now amber herd's lawyer falls to her knees
mels/030229.pt|no doubt in my mind i was impressed
mels/007279.pt|okay i'm here to help him out wherever
mels/017771.pt|there is a much higher chance than let's say
mels/020637.pt|loving the award and then also ninja
mels/023136.pt|with the dolphins but consumers were concerned that they were somehow harming dolphins when they ate it
mels/024448.pt|it's that shows me basically trending new commercials every week that have been
mels/004348.pt|or whatever i got this bro i swear to god the funniest
mels/019127.pt|larger than life but you're not
mels/005414.pt|that's right now i'm sure you're making out all right
mels/026883.pt|process it it moves too much it's
mels/008542.pt|i know they were and they get paid a huge amount for damages because they've been obviously severely impacted people are quitting and they've been on a hiring freeze and so they're probably i think this is my guess what happens is twitter gets paid between
mels/021927.pt|pay taxes because i'll go to jail
mels/012926.pt|in an investment you can with a cost of almost
mels/005034.pt|it's and every post so every person
mels/023493.pt|truck month isn't even a consistent month you're right they just do truck
mels/009145.pt|hold out to the woke mob
mels/018506.pt|these consumer products people aren't buying walkmans though let
mels/032382.pt|i start recording and that's when i that's literally what
mels/002470.pt|there was no there was no
mels/031209.pt|i'm charles painter and today we're going to be talking about the marketing campaigns of the
mels/029267.pt|the final addition to their party
mels/026055.pt|it's alive plug with a penny the girl asked the lexa for a challenge to do plugin a phone charger about halfway into a wall outlet then touch a it's a live plug with a penny the girl asked alexa for a challenge to do
mels/011883.pt|if moving very slowly so you feel like you're you know like i was impressed with the
mels/013607.pt|well he's like no i got
mels/000818.pt|not seriously but i thought about it i thought about it i was gonna do
mels/021777.pt|this one needs to be watched and that of
mels/029041.pt|is this a fight or flight situation so i go like this
mels/016402.pt|printed out of thin air but our current inflation crisis that we're experiencing the higher gas prices
mels/021115.pt|die on this hill okay if you guys want me
mels/030472.pt|we were alone it was just the table the waiter brought the food and again so i have been stalling throughout this trip because i wanted to do it early and by now it's like pretty far into the trip valentine's day and if i don't do it today
mels/017394.pt|i played league of legends and there was a funny clip out of it where emiru didn't remember doing a game
mels/024170.pt|if the platform deals are hard to say no to because especially if you're not like incredibly still hungry to grow they provide you like the stability of being like i'm good with twitch you could
mels/005966.pt|the i mean it literally is the reenactment of that
mels/023374.pt|and figure it out yourself cause i'm stumped and so i instantly
mels/000041.pt|cause yeah canada is the world's largest live play every single person is part of a massive social experiment and every year they let in one fake
mels/002690.pt|at all there's no way to lose and there is no downside i'm
mels/000985.pt|am i doing what's going on you got
mels/003354.pt|the on mortgages then we have a real 2009 type
mels/018838.pt|i don't forget your smile when
mels/002515.pt|so i need you to say the word
mels/018809.pt|examples of positioning of all time they
mels/010082.pt|me who's a bit of a degenerate or gamer and you don't like to cook and
mels/017441.pt|okay the reason i didn't drink or do drugs um was because i didn't get invited
mels/007807.pt|here's the deal i have a question for you so i have a wins and fails
mels/026072.pt|a quick fail here for bad journalism okay you guys know this is
mels/030989.pt|who was very upset about it because he wanted to jack the rents
mels/010340.pt|it's no one's like it's not a bombshell if nvidia
mels/010801.pt|what what if it's a great movie dude
mels/012333.pt|we're going to need to pick them up with your goliat
mels/019664.pt|in the paper i put some stuff together i wrote
mels/001842.pt|it is now down to a very absurd time i think it's down to
mels/015500.pt|disney prints money with theme parks it's because
mels/027468.pt|it's a good question for statement continues
mels/012697.pt|if if you have friends that are
mels/016957.pt|you can get a free stock by using my
mels/007941.pt|so you have to believe in it tony thank you
mels/008729.pt|it has to be i think it's
mels/000447.pt|what's next to me the whole time germa
mels/025693.pt|you're selling consoles to gamers i
mels/014428.pt|is it and they use it because you use it okay
mels/022702.pt|hundred million dollars but all that did was drive the few people that were still using tumblr off the website
mels/006903.pt|and i made no money when i started a
mels/013444.pt|star wars is so broad and
mels/007721.pt|and the community but i don't know a lick of spanish
mels/032221.pt|but then we have this idea sort of enters our brains wait a minute the field was due two hands ago
mels/022882.pt|the actual clip from right before tim sweeney took to make his opening
mels/007946.pt|is what makes it all worthwhile and
mels/014173.pt|so they went for somebody who's connected to every group on twitch to somebody who really is sort of the avatar someone who
mels/012376.pt|it's not he didn't carry along he was a
mels/026290.pt|itself but that model has changed the world of marketing
mels/031074.pt|yeah this i can tell that he's like
mels/013044.pt|with how the learning is done so everything is very rote everything is
mels/020510.pt|the chances of people falling for the
mels/027998.pt|it's surprising first of the year failed xbox
mels/016643.pt|very high cost locations where there's not much sunlight will still be cheaper to have uh solar
mels/015508.pt|if you notice if you notice
mels/007029.pt|if the first time i got the trolls i
mels/022039.pt|is different from the bk tweet
mels/017455.pt|kellogg's strike in the rain with the hibachi sitting there this person
mels/009917.pt|the really understand you can't just be like please
mels/013247.pt|things can't get dangerous for you

mels/000124.pt|it is that dude you can hear me having lost my
mels/018525.pt|one of their biggest advantages sony had was better games they have more consistent lineup of
mels/008576.pt|pretty obviously in the right i think if you were to simplify it the example i would say is like
mels/022603.pt|don't even have to be in a pool to experience it
mels/026204.pt|i want to poor shame stands but his tv is
mels/020406.pt|why why when he's buying the oreo

mels/008708.pt|see a bot that seems likely one
mels/022541.pt|ready but like to an extreme it wasn't
mels/027187.pt|there's no disputing that so let's go uh
mels/000356.pt|and apparently i mean it turns out it's
mels/024889.pt|well actually one of the most devious examples i've seen
mels/004284.pt|i'm talking make a clip of this and we're going to listen it back and i'm going to
mels/016151.pt|what months shine your light on me think of the nine months

mels/005647.pt|the next day after the nails thing with connor after i get my
mels/003798.pt|joke about the gauntlet like the threat of proletarian violence would probably get them to act in the in
mels/019745.pt|it it definitely sounds like that
mels/013017.pt|what the people doing history whatever
mels/005079.pt|so we are going to look at the funniest and best tweets of the summer which i have compiled here
mels/003750.pt|go to jail and so when you make an actual crime
mels/026751.pt|is that the problem governments would block it
mels/030261.pt|my hair is lustrous and full my face
mels/019378.pt|learn from us because they wanted to get better grades and so they they started to look at what we were doing which is why i had carefully named all of our products incorrectly now let me give

mels/014916.pt|this is a really important win this is
mels/031091.pt|it's like he's turned that story into a
mels/025564.pt|pretty much the last thing we had over robot dogs that we
mels/011997.pt|at the help out rey and the resistance
mels/023527.pt|so they just get a ton of money per car it's not as big of a business but it creates them
mels/026796.pt|if the the government is um
mels/002198.pt|it's good for everyone to be more informed is like
mels/020090.pt|do you want to sell sugar water or do you want to change the world and so he gets the ceo of pepsi to come
mels/002486.pt|i even like psychological trickery it's that the big companies just won't they just bully the store all but the biggest stores either they'll have an agreement or they'll

mels/027413.pt|would not be competed with by the government they wouldn't make their own free software as long as they would agree to offer a free version to the majority of americans okay but the thing they did is do everything possible to hide that
mels/004989.pt|just floundering in all directions for public support
mels/011817.pt|at the theater men and women
mels/027537.pt|that being said and even though i've ragged on tesla's stock price before because i think it's crazy high tesla is a good company so as opposed to what's happened at twitter which has been disaster

mels/007399.pt|due to covered some people didn't make their flights or whatever so but it was it was it was rowdy in there it was packed and it due to covet some people didn't make their flights or whatever so
mels/022303.pt|let me tell you something if you have

mels/020553.pt|in the company but i wouldn't until they've proven they can solve these problems without killing
mels/005406.pt|yeah i wanna i wanna like i mean youtube's very rewarding in a way that twitch is left which is fun
mels/029848.pt|a long time in a youtube video and it's
mels/015325.pt|so jeff bezos personally demanded he went to his executives and he personally demanded his own game of thrones jeff bezos said i want us to have our own game of thrones i don't care what it costs this is a true
mels/020281.pt|for is deserved instead of paying
mels/020431.pt|i think we landed on a zero or a cringe for this one there is a single soda ad that
mels/003741.pt|why politicians before but like let's say
mels/005241.pt|you know no big deal and i
mels/020310.pt|they screwed melee over so it's a one and we stand by that you think the kids parents should die i'm noticing a trend
mels/005226.pt|and they did lose a little bit but i want to
mels/003630.pt|it's an american thing yeah for sure and
mels/000749.pt|not doing much social stuff for the past like eight months really because i've
mels/017173.pt|which means we are due for a couple things
mels/024705.pt|or valueless owning a bunch of
mels/031415.pt|i underneath the house is like a beach that is basically owned by them and the neighbors

mels/020932.pt|storage storage is competing against old lazy businesses like who's that
mels/004695.pt|but we have to talk about some stuff we
mels/018305.pt|the five dude what a great ad boys if you aren't out
mels/023633.pt|as in the lgbtq community but now now that
mels/019878.pt|phone number four let's watch the star wars
mels/000890.pt|goofy and wacky that that sounds like a nickelodeon show this is a serious stream with serious discussions
mels/009528.pt|that's not a bad idea tell him to stay back
mels/003458.pt|you have china for whatever reason that wouldn't be able to to make the chips they need to function in the modern economy so it's very very important strategic importance lunch like taiwan you know we need to defend it because raw democracy it's like that that's the you have china for whatever reason they wouldn't be able to to make the chips they need to function in the modern economy so it's very very impo it's strategically
mels/008290.pt|i'll miss you fix my light a little bit
mels/000326.pt|you know you can anyway so i'm in a squad with
mels/004165.pt|got engaged today but still can't skip marketing monday i
mels/003081.pt|they were just having a lot more economic troubles inflation's
mels/014506.pt|his audience and primes would go to him
mels/017436.pt|okay there is no luxury of time
mels/022145.pt|it really was just a terrible experience that being said this was my fault
mels/018249.pt|i am happy to share it with
mels/017361.pt|well children to touch live plugs with pennies this really happened i don't know what caused it i don't know but this is a true story this actually happened i thought it was fake i looked into it it
mels/020554.pt|in the developers a few episodes ago we made a list of the most overhyped games of all time and i said we'll see after launch
mels/009897.pt|once a guy from new zealand told me that people say new zealanders and canadians are similar and i responded must be the accent and he didn't realize it was a joke and was like uh no i don't think so
mels/031127.pt|were funny but like someone like lyric doesn't barely
mels/026911.pt|i think it's pretty smart i think as far as ads
mels/004223.pt|people that are like sad about this is zera so there's no
mels/011765.pt|right off the bat in character this
mels/023055.pt|we're going to be like hey apple's a little bit too big
mels/010209.pt|wow how could that possibly have happened oh i'm just a streamer it was
mels/012381.pt|day and that was wrapping up the big finale on night two i'm just
mels/007680.pt|it's not that bad sheesh a
mels/021796.pt|has lived in kansas kansas ain't in the middle of red and
mels/022258.pt|is that got me we need a breather okay

mels/021304.pt|these are the top gaming streams of all
mels/031568.pt|even if you're the greatest macro
mels/002440.pt|i can sort of pow right out of the big kahuna burger yeah
mels/004781.pt|at all the hassle of running twitter and he certainly didn't want to put all of his wealth that was
mels/030952.pt|okay wearing a suit and tie
mels/028905.pt|very very very long flight of stairs to where the bathroom was and so when you're that drunk a huge flight of stairs is very intimidating and apparently i dragged my roommate diego and i was like diego i need help i need help to get to this bathroom okay so he the way he tells the story is that he spent 20 minutes
mels/021128.pt|talk about it it's like impressive i
mels/024861.pt|they have something different that draws the attention of the
mels/022778.pt|right before that like actually basically as it was happening not even before it but like as
mels/020689.pt|indie game thank god they didn't
mels/031154.pt|what the people would say something like
mels/024532.pt|are they brought an apple executive onto
mels/010345.pt|in here we weren't talking about
mels/028967.pt|if the people okay so i go and i apply for a new debit card and it's going to be sent to the military base the
mels/025972.pt|or life and time into it that they are
mels/006971.pt|oh yeah he doesn't have it i didn't see
mels/014953.pt|if you don't have an accountant it basically tracks all your expenses and separates them from business
mels/007451.pt|this is a random story but i'll tell it because it's interesting
mels/024441.pt|see this you kind of can't look away if you're at the right angle i feel like
mels/019229.pt|the Wii did so many things to say this
mels/004042.pt|cause i would have been miserable it was so god damned goddamned annoying
mels/009100.pt|how to fix that for you okay i can't hand deliver you a better volume knob and turn it up that's something you have to deal with yourself
mels/011311.pt|if the first semester was coven
mels/017853.pt|my god it's hot in here
mels/019871.pt|and has a ton of players and a ton of money so they have a ton of developers working around the clock
mels/024380.pt|that money went the main things i can

mels/008726.pt|well the money that twitter has made so far from their normal business dealings has been made fraudulently every
mels/010233.pt|if he did some kind of
mels/018236.pt|the jeep there's so many questions i have so i can pull more than the
mels/011720.pt|okay this is it wait let me

mels/017020.pt|if the thing even think about marketing call the can't even if the thing to think about marketing cold i can't even imagine
mels/010947.pt|it will be it'll be the minions take over the entire
mels/024150.pt|as they they're both gigantic and did not get a good renegotiation you know what i'm saying they're not getting a fat contract from
mels/017069.pt|white honest what happened to the youtube oh um quack
mels/004786.pt|let me pull that up again one more time
mels/008599.pt|if the legal team he looks this contract he reads it through he agrees he shakes hands
mels/011944.pt|what are guests total on the whole
mels/028420.pt|he retired as a colonel like one step

mels/014935.pt|services let's jump into it today's topic oh wait wait
mels/013078.pt|you're actually wanting to learn and focus
mels/009459.pt|the games they snowball out of control
mels/019782.pt|we're never going to be in the game they just openly misrepresented what
mels/021237.pt|i want to ask you guys if you look at this picture what do you see not just girl gamers
mels/006416.pt|really really good stuff it's always like stuff that really is actionable
mels/020032.pt|it's just nothing it's just nothing now they are worth an estimated and part of their contribution to google
mels/007470.pt|and i want to order breakfast for dinner because i'm quirky like that
mels/030150.pt|in a fight today over who could type faster
mels/008229.pt|is that there's a chance that could work but
mels/027794.pt|well the inflation video there's two outcomes and
mels/029683.pt|during his prime he was virtually unbeatable
mels/013869.pt|i can give it to me i will give you 1 000
mels/020336.pt|expected it was demanded things started off great we had our grand opening customer
mels/010691.pt|well i'm interested i'd like to know you know it's get a vibe check i'm doing good
mels/012774.pt|he would talk to me about making
mels/032177.pt|with chair eight times okay now this is where either the worst or the best thing happened to
mels/022026.pt|and social it's like property of the public so you really have to you have to err sometimes on being a
mels/009882.pt|right now but moving to europe
mels/006084.pt|wait a minute you thought the clip was
mels/023048.pt|i mean eventually it happened what's
mels/019201.pt|the made fun of for having a GameCube
mels/011114.pt|it does keep it simple it does keep it simple all right well he says i think
mels/012169.pt|like my favorite thing to do on vacations i want to play
mels/026378.pt|if the for apple among their over over their tech
mels/022072.pt|there was no difference that's it's the
mels/023309.pt|and move on which is it takes discipline and cocoa
mels/027306.pt|really undercut that because we're not all that mentally strong for a lot of people getting stuck on
mels/004306.pt|what's wrong with the dangle you got a problem with
mels/006556.pt|one thousand dollars that you don't have with buy now pay later you still have to pay i think you're thinking of the buy now
mels/003007.pt|and you still hear commotion from
mels/028071.pt|i just always makes me think i i really like
mels/018971.pt|it's not just a shorter episode secondly they didn't understand their competitors so their competitors were this
mels/020119.pt|make you smarter but it is interesting
mels/017487.pt|well reagan basically there has been um
mels/008235.pt|take to take the take the initiative here
mels/003333.pt|these are kind of small wins in the grand scheme of things but it is a slight bit of progress because
mels/003048.pt|we we've called all day today they don't answer we
mels/030265.pt|we the weirdest look and he's like
mels/022570.pt|you know because the meme has a gun and
mels/022932.pt|if you're wondering how they can talk to sony like this
mels/023535.pt|it is unique there is no there's no product like the iphone that sells as many as it does and still has the high perceived value how do monopoly sustain themselves
mels/032274.pt|alice dollars and pocketed it and just said you lost bro
mels/027529.pt|ak jack stepped down it was their old ceo
mels/002031.pt|editor well he's a ticket editor who
mels/006908.pt|i literally went home to sleep at like midnight
mels/003645.pt|over the years which used to be very dramatic and the estate tax is one of the great resetters that makes
mels/025315.pt|it's it's the future it's amazing it's changing everything it's crazy kryptos
mels/001536.pt|these guys are so stupid in my chat everyone's
mels/004832.pt|is it the big ten count baby
mels/025842.pt|or for their movie with legendary pictures to make a
mels/017742.pt|the better dealerships car dealerships in general are a bad
mels/031813.pt|it's to me it's me and lincus
mels/011682.pt|i'm not a theater kid you know i'm not discord mod could be worse maybe you're right
mels/032330.pt|i had the foremost expert i just did it there's not a vast difference in skill in fact i'm quite sure that p five for me at least was harder there is zero chance he completed whatever you're not finish naga forestry with his i i the foremost expert i just did it there's not a vast difference in skill in fact i'm quite sure
mels/031862.pt|but the player base new players young players are not picking up
mels/028081.pt|so actually their first solution was to partner with motorola and they
mels/016949.pt|we can follow me on that app and see what i'm investing in you can follow many other
mels/015319.pt|book sales business and your and all that
mels/020925.pt|hot for a better player from korea right that's probably what it would have been i would have wasted two more years
mels/022608.pt|new product you can go like super goofy like this or you can go like on the edge of believable
mels/028219.pt|you know he's just like oh you're
mels/004949.pt|just a huge song and dance back and forth with elon musk that has made them both look bad
mels/023200.pt|so companies will just slap it on anything that's not selling and
mels/000919.pt|was on i call them goggles
mels/004722.pt|when it comes out tomorrow okay
mels/032230.pt|where i'm like wow what are we doing and i watch him take fifteen hundred dollars the atm was not far from the table i think stan's told
mels/012521.pt|you'd probably have a blast i think you'd probably have a blast i think some people did that and i think they had a great time because the actors never turned you down they never they never like don't banter with you
mels/021452.pt|that is completely wrong and i'm not trying to make fun of you but
mels/027991.pt|what's happening the only difference between this situation starfield which was one of
mels/020157.pt|making them more cynical to growth or authenticity they have full access to social media
mels/019628.pt|jingle i would love the story i wonder if i
mels/011186.pt|is a bartender so like not saying that we do anything illegal but like
mels/013356.pt|i'm trying to help you you think
mels/012436.pt|and okay let me get to the end
mels/007844.pt|it was bonehead by naked city no no no no
mels/022670.pt|intro because today is the top five times companies lit billions of dollars on fire the five worst
mels/004953.pt|but on monday i think they're gonna tank
mels/007833.pt|i can't say it again because the moment's
mels/023471.pt|the that is purely from the brand it costs
mels/013800.pt|thinking about what's on screen at all
mels/026513.pt|some of the more egregious crypto ideas comes from gamers
mels/031823.pt|the fact that i'm finally in variety is
mels/026735.pt|with reason the fourth reason is the
mels/019121.pt|perfect time for like a tactical
mels/026100.pt|anyway whatever it is it all seems really cool it all seems really cool let me do one more we're
mels/013863.pt|just buy it and forget about them
mels/022403.pt|as it's already over geico 15 minutes could save you
mels/012016.pt|they friday like they kind of already knew that i was evil and that
mels/030321.pt|i smiled they said for the first time in 30 years
mels/022723.pt|tell this man has they bought um nokia
mels/007068.pt|i've never been like i said i've never been
mels/017702.pt|they were very slash extremely satisfied after their visit these are unheard of numbers in the world of
mels/020793.pt|is that no matter how far down
mels/012970.pt|oh goddamn long people are just quitting like people are not joining
mels/023109.pt|you're outside of the system marketers can't touch you and that is why you're the king that is why you only accept the finest attendees of course
mels/024765.pt|some of the psychological tricks that they use okay that i
mels/029173.pt|average viewers in the whole site is 300
mels/008683.pt|read a lot of different opinions from people
mels/026315.pt|the price tags of like a gucci they are the only company in human history
mels/014582.pt|it's of dollars here and they're not worried about looking like they're
mels/002452.pt|i think more like would jeff would
mels/020930.pt|it's basically a little bit more market oriented it's that if you want to open up a trendy bar there's a lot of people that want to do that because it's cool so it's very competitive your margins which is the difference between what you what you bring
mels/016515.pt|let's see if i can fix that
mels/013680.pt|go all right ready tag yourself
mels/009831.pt|but yeah maybe it's gas prices yeah yeah are gas prices caught up
mels/020412.pt|it's like a little bit off we don't like him also this guy looks forty i dunno i also think the elf could it's like a little bit off we don't like them also this guy looks 40 i don't know i
mels/022061.pt|are still logged into the brand account and thinking they're on their personal account
mels/015997.pt|our movie that would cost me thousands of dollars in dvds and now i spend nine bucks and i
mels/001760.pt|the other two do not the chief
mels/007449.pt|it any more stories but it was just a fun time hanging out celebrating
mels/009666.pt|now for some real i think
mels/026212.pt|where of these companies that are starting to pop up that are having massive success under a model that is being called
mels/013977.pt|that there is no different and i listen to
mels/025436.pt|we are one coke away from
mels/018424.pt|okay let me explain why that's important because
mels/009773.pt|what's the house anything in the news what's what's what's the what's what's the vibe
mels/009231.pt|flip it around so it's like it
mels/031257.pt|i bridge had a stairway so i walk up that access
mels/027183.pt|if branding but first a little bit of background elton ring just dropped last
mels/016419.pt|rarely to fraudsters and rich people they get to buy the houses they get to buy the
mels/028563.pt|walk down to me tell me what i need to do so
mels/031858.pt|someone's gotta say it and it probably is already not even me but whoever said that
mels/010442.pt|anyway i didn't read his name so you'll never know
mels/003838.pt|you could easily i mean for
mels/005064.pt|with the cool that the richest people on earth are flouting the legal system
mels/005470.pt|the to jump cut i was at fourth of july with my family i went to see my family my
mels/020623.pt|to be reading this award i almost want to get up and floss i almost want to get up and floss but i
mels/022760.pt|billion dollars a little under one billion okay
mels/027366.pt|where of your brand assets and to confirm that i decided to read a lot of interviews with me as aka himself and i found this quote that really sums it up for me that it just mean they understand it so he said we're always looking to improve where of your brand essence and to confirm that i decided to read a lot of interviews with miyazaki himself and i found this quote
mels/008716.pt|why a company he doesn't wanna run
mels/022298.pt|that could be like a really fun sweet
mels/009695.pt|i ordered my quincy plushie fingers
mels/014843.pt|into the day i think fans are making it very clear they don't want
mels/005299.pt|it's all it's like it is chill
mels/007320.pt|so i was taking a lot of these bets and
mels/030292.pt|one random chat or pay for everything like literally two weeks before the
mels/028749.pt|a restaurant and we get in because he's there and we
mels/009658.pt|handshakes that was a pretty dominant
mels/022301.pt|this is a business relationship at this point stop playing the victim
mels/017591.pt|purchase this is like in-store it's like
mels/010090.pt|mix them all together and most importantly they'll
mels/025860.pt|but when you're a big game company it starts to look bad year after year when everybody
mels/023608.pt|am i'm not the expert by any means mostly
mels/005045.pt|okay we don't want to actually engage with other people it's too much pressure half of twitter is fighting it's too angry
mels/025437.pt|he salutes his own character so the
mels/004199.pt|if vague like anything could have gone bad in another universe ever heard of man in
mels/026672.pt|just because people are older and more successful than me in the world of business does not mean they are smart
mels/004147.pt|i told them that it's like hey i didn't know you
mels/016437.pt|in the final l to a person who i consider one of the closest i found to
mels/028482.pt|is like you are not taking responsibility
mels/018666.pt|for i'm trying to give you a visual the
mels/000235.pt|in your sad and whenever also sad you're sad and whenever else is sad
mels/015632.pt|the companies can and they don't have the creative power to beat
mels/018992.pt|i mean and quickly within six months
mels/016347.pt|because we're getting to a lot of great
mels/015747.pt|if the people which means if you add that up and carry the one and our next
mels/000180.pt|is the real hangover if you think about it dude it
mels/020918.pt|what other people it'll be competitive as
mels/003865.pt|say like i don't you you'd hope it would be about the
mels/004663.pt|apparently was a heavy shareholder in nvidia and she came by
mels/001530.pt|we're all the american that knows absolutely nothing
mels/011123.pt|so i'm constantly lowering and turning the
mels/024053.pt|the act to reverse their uh
mels/010789.pt|what kind of a morbius where you invent a new thing and you
mels/000230.pt|and i don't need to explain what
mels/018996.pt|oh by trade by profession and often in the course of my marketing i will have to get influencers and i came across an influencer she was relatable okay she was uh i mean let's be honest
mels/028794.pt|at the time she goes so you're not
mels/012022.pt|the ship all get trained in lightsabers by a
mels/030336.pt|yeah this is this is like
mels/002849.pt|if the for elon in this particular battle
mels/003469.pt|of the dog but what i will try to do is get a little bit more balanced so it's not so bleak but i do want to
mels/023853.pt|it just says now more delicious so but the thing is people
mels/027517.pt|instead of building really nice building all these people are engineers almost all
mels/014859.pt|okay well no actually you know what
mels/025085.pt|it's like people that have use the product people that spend money to go to university phoenix often feel it's like people that have used the product people that spend money
mels/016091.pt|listed below they have twitch and youtube and
mels/004019.pt|i felt this guy woke up
mels/024759.pt|i think in this past year more than that actually more than a
mels/030592.pt|where were the first silly wait so do you guys
mels/017064.pt|we may not be able to get to
mels/026354.pt|what allowed apple to get a massive head start in the
mels/031910.pt|for all of us for like all the friend group to go to prom i shouldn't tell
mels/019791.pt|this game was a kickstarter game that promised to bring back the magic of mega man to rekindle what mega man fans had lost
mels/012268.pt|kind of annoying at some points he
mels/020127.pt|the fly the drinking pepsi max while listening to the sweet sounds of snoop the fly than drinking pepsi max while listening to the sweet sounds of snoop
mels/018368.pt|what it means is that some other human being sees your work as valuable and
mels/001315.pt|the videos yeah and it's like i didn't know that i
mels/027424.pt|because we can still own these brands on
mels/005003.pt|well have already left they're gonna have them
mels/009454.pt|a pretty hefty amount on beast
mels/017829.pt|i bought an expensive graphics card is massive it is a massive way to grow brand value in
mels/021462.pt|that still have some revenue but are declining and so today they basically just called in all their billionaire rich favors to stop millions of average people from being able to trade
mels/018107.pt|i swear to god god gamer
mels/002621.pt|please the straw i'm cheering for you on this
mels/019307.pt|years old probably i in general spent most of my college time
mels/002940.pt|if the and then you put them in situations
mels/002964.pt|yeah dude everyone knows the name sierra 6.
mels/024427.pt|it's full of water i mean
mels/009558.pt|even when they win they lose because of
mels/010005.pt|he hasn't really crossed over into twitter they're not i don't think twitter even knows
mels/024054.pt|the bad pr they were getting end of the day though they haven't solved the core problem it's not like it's over for them being closely associated with adult content sex work makes the banks nervous and they need hundreds of millions of dollars every month to pale creators the bad pr they were getting end of the day though they haven't solved the core problem it's not like it's over for them being closely associated with adult content and sex work makes the banks nervous and they need hundreds of
mels/024535.pt|and he said the beginning middle and end and you can get points and that was their definition of a game it was just one of the many quotes that i thought were
mels/016963.pt|they will pay that fee for you they cover everything which i found to be pretty cool as someone who has uh fees from my
mels/027240.pt|maybe a thing worth considering is why many players are so forgiving of rough edges
mels/014724.pt|obviously that wasn't good obviously that
mels/016482.pt|and just a regular guy making low six figures obviously doing quite well for himself but very privileged but at the end of the day he wasn't a
mels/003288.pt|actual win okay let me get you a goddamn
mels/032089.pt|he had about enough to write the opening the first three or four jokes and then he ran out so he had to fill
mels/019738.pt|well it's really a fail on our
mels/029566.pt|it felt like a really positive trend that ultimately
mels/023117.pt|so what they've been doing this is only one of many many names is they have legally found almost any other name they could put on the label other than high fructose corn syrup i've found 10 they'll call it
mels/028421.pt|star general he was almost at
mels/003134.pt|the find the thing wait this could be the
mels/004868.pt|about the idea that anyone working remotely is stealing from the company i think he said
mels/027408.pt|we're in mind and so the government started to develop
mels/009228.pt|smash your head is that what i'm hearing is that am i reading through the line
mels/024645.pt|in construction and stuff that no
mels/024877.pt|we all said it was worthless or worth like two
mels/008126.pt|and i think ludwig as someone who's also a very extremely privileged white person would probably want to donate to the cause so i'm just
mels/029837.pt|some bangers if he says we got
mels/012257.pt|i because the most fun thing for me was
mels/021222.pt|are based on entirely how much the office you can watch this is pick your peacock and they
mels/020320.pt|at the time is true now is true now
mels/017826.pt|for all companies but nvidia drivers are generally better generally easier to use and
mels/012616.pt|it took our bags to the to the uber were
mels/030514.pt|like that it was kind of it
mels/025053.pt|the all microsoft probably windows complaints if
mels/016425.pt|at the hard assets the people that were close to the government and the

mels/004267.pt|in between they're like a metaverse token
mels/011799.pt|open the door and it's like right off the bat

mels/007163.pt|and i'm not immune to that right so saying one one area is right
mels/002235.pt|would it be only one to ask that
mels/019946.pt|i created this chart this is master chief sized at
mels/011158.pt|no actually i think the tv
mels/014761.pt|at my wedding there's there's not even there's a real chance that guy plays at my wedding
mels/027242.pt|and i think there are i think that there are are
mels/027801.pt|the party in power always loses when the great recession happened
mels/002261.pt|i can't believe it you've been following
mels/006019.pt|and than anyone else and most you know like most
mels/006444.pt|and this was all a good thing when i was
mels/014644.pt|donna marketing wednesday this feels weird to
mels/014711.pt|the solve world water issues did she ask she's
mels/021328.pt|so much is that we're entering the year of loneliness because people are looking for any
mels/011621.pt|the she gets way into it more than me so like i introduced her for example in the lord
mels/018975.pt|better for zoomers and the problem was
mels/006972.pt|wall street bets is like okay the
mels/022870.pt|versus epic lawsuit kicked off today tim sweeney versus tim
mels/013999.pt|add company it's always been my dream to take a company that defrauded millions of families and slap their logo on a

mels/023832.pt|i have got the wins and fails portion
mels/023835.pt|what he had made it had
mels/030759.pt|i had a lot of phone calls
mels/028904.pt|at the door and up a
mels/004907.pt|the board of twitter started to like do everything possible to stop elon musk from getting a majority control of twitter
mels/014771.pt|do that i want to announce sorry one second i want to announce a brand new
mels/001911.pt|in my editor one dollar a year as part of the nominal agreement that we put together that kind of cuts into my profit see the problem is i have to give away that one
mels/010066.pt|it too boring but number three and most importantly at the end of the video we have to have learned something can't be pure entertainment
mels/011104.pt|like seven years that's a long time this
mels/017350.pt|okay other i i need to be on this side i want
mels/028534.pt|while we're we're full like we we
mels/009790.pt|from the largest real estate companies are doing that but not some don't have to do
mels/027444.pt|can you imagine being taco bell
mels/008998.pt|but it's it's challenging the throne
mels/031909.pt|i took uh cleopatra okay so we rented a lemo
mels/002600.pt|that's morbius i i do be getting heads
mels/004706.pt|one month anniversary of the pop-a-thon
mels/021241.pt|if people having fun the answer is dollar signs that's what the rest of the world is starting to see from
mels/013051.pt|yeah that's one of the downsides like if you if you invest more teachers you get more good teachers you have to
mels/029241.pt|it was up it was like it was a
mels/003123.pt|you hear you worked there i did work
mels/025389.pt|i one hundred thieves hoodie or
mels/002828.pt|it's possible because while they're in this ongoing legal battle it is
mels/002095.pt|tons of money to get cards that can play
mels/010828.pt|two tournaments on saturday i am playing fall guys tournament
mels/002878.pt|that negatively massively impacts the revenues or he needs to figure out
mels/009401.pt|i have to tell him that in an ezreal
mels/026482.pt|if they bought this book at auction with this plan to make the book public to produce an original animated series inspired by the book and sell it to a streaming service and to support derivative projects from the community
mels/031400.pt|done good the fellas the fellas
mels/006268.pt|it's prospects please t y is that your
mels/022584.pt|or environments and games like the last of us remastered are more
mels/022385.pt|oh my god can you believe red bull created this
mels/019089.pt|now a needs your support so
mels/013385.pt|at obviously they shouldn't be doing a
mels/026657.pt|is right now if you were to click the
mels/009083.pt|gaming vibing talking doing all sorts
mels/030154.pt|he won game one i got a pop-up
mels/030326.pt|me let me try to well first let me show you a picture
mels/010157.pt|we to make sure that i'm cool that i'm
mels/023337.pt|it kind of stunned me and that is this it was announced today there is now a
mels/018593.pt|it there's two options no yeah
mels/000665.pt|the laughing at him like stop stop stop giving and then
mels/009293.pt|is mentally they're just very susceptible and so if they're playing a game that has loot boxes they like cannot resist
mels/025892.pt|he was playing like his freedom
mels/028260.pt|the she is almost in tears describing how terrible this person wants to work with nothing
mels/006601.pt|i have one more sorry i have um
mels/011110.pt|at their fake you want to do you know that they're fake you know what i mean
mels/001711.pt|the character as he appears in the original
mels/000951.pt|so we'll be doing get smarter
mels/019517.pt|what i don't like it and why i think it's it seats
mels/000555.pt|the of money i think how much were they i mean i don't want to i think it's
mels/028800.pt|which i probably wouldn't keep making that same amount if you
mels/006920.pt|you probably noticed the title eric
mels/015780.pt|what companies on sports rights and it's changing the game because once they lose sports they literally have nothing
mels/027047.pt|i have no strong take on it i wish this ad was better because i would like to be
mels/018652.pt|two billion dollars and it's worth it discord is actually
mels/015921.pt|they have to keep adding great shows to keep that listen you drop a squid game you can raise prices that's that's basically
mels/012015.pt|like it's like the half day friday full day saturday after sunday after the half day
mels/016845.pt|you know moore's law and uh and it is
mels/027542.pt|don't change it now let me talk about some of the upsides and downsides so the only reason there are basically two reasons that the board of twitter would not want to accept his deal because you know this is this is all about money
mels/008706.pt|is true in your head but
mels/006928.pt|and sometimes i rinse but i don't wash my
mels/018851.pt|is your mascot right he's clearly in love with this girl he's reminiscing about her
mels/018280.pt|i think it was written by
mels/023312.pt|let me give you a fail though the fail is every single one of you
mels/002448.pt|on the weekends he goes to concerts and he has a problem with his mobile
mels/006455.pt|and get it before it hits the and get in before it hits the moon uh
mels/031697.pt|we're going to pretend that it's a real
mels/013541.pt|but he would do it all the time like a hundred like like
mels/018745.pt|the the thousand dollars on a phone
mels/001208.pt|it started in marketing that's hustle culture gone wrong just be
mels/012276.pt|and all i want to do is win this dude i
mels/023423.pt|they they live their life like they're
mels/010098.pt|one canada i think it might even be us only but worth checking go to
mels/001785.pt|it was 17. logan or david
mels/000053.pt|if that i would skip it because my bachelor party yes on sunday when all the boys were out partying i said no i said boys you go enjoy yourself there's learning to be done and i sat my white ass down
mels/018259.pt|so in general it's a good way to farm i i never count
mels/000727.pt|it's pure degenerate degenerate gambling frog from from that point on we vegas just beat the brakes of us they go our money back we if we don't walked away then not mag in the ffiec but vegas always gets the last laugh always gets the last laugh and it's pure degenerate degenerate gambling from from from that point on we vegas just beat the brakes off of us
mels/025149.pt|that's the most unrealistic part of this
mels/020685.pt|never heard of them came out of nowhere to win the world's hearts with this game in fact we ran the numbers this game had only a mere nine million pre-orders only 9 million pre-orders
mels/014117.pt|the big creator in these years now that's a
mels/008790.pt|so it's that's where it becomes really
mels/023895.pt|which means he had to lose
mels/021860.pt|can you draw your own conclusions just weird that like most of this seemed to happen after i joined and started shaking things up you know if you are too focused on
mels/006668.pt|in a second it's it bloons is an insane insane game
mels/004753.pt|what your different loans that had different
mels/025181.pt|i don't think you meant for your logo to look suggestive but right now this looks like two knees to me i don't want to be
mels/002145.pt|i finally caught a stream love your stuff
mels/017729.pt|with thinking about this type of this this
mels/027838.pt|what the cash as the time goes
mels/013894.pt|there's nothing to get about i'm
mels/024475.pt|if the day you you fast forward
mels/017797.pt|part of the mango nation he rewards
mels/028670.pt|all the time dude twitch culture was like a
mels/028666.pt|in front of a lot of other
mels/000570.pt|at a plan on sunday this is cutie's idea
mels/028363.pt|and i say zoom out all the time i think
mels/027914.pt|or twice as bad and getting worse at least you can make your money back by
mels/003739.pt|super pacs and donate money to them and it was protected as speech
mels/029294.pt|it's really like that's a nice
mels/024819.pt|the thousand up there is actually clearly
mels/014695.pt|we got um stream stream elements is
mels/020970.pt|okay one of them was about what was quote unquote the funniest ad of
mels/031638.pt|the rest of the night i distinctly remember i saved moon's evening that that was like the most interaction
mels/005402.pt|and and i was like that sounds dope because i'm a hustler grinder and i want
mels/030356.pt|so i planned this vacation and as you guys know i had this vacation
mels/001433.pt|we very restrictive no cheater okay here's the question what is the name of
mels/005658.pt|just totally like she just seemed totally normal
mels/000178.pt|like they didn't tell me anything ahead of time so the only thing i knew going in is when i got leaked when i was at
mels/027613.pt|random rank and file employees i don't think there's like a mass firing
mels/012428.pt|that is a grown man i
mels/018199.pt|in discovered in market research and knew
mels/000712.pt|he he it's just me and him at the table right we have drinks and
mels/007291.pt|and it'll make sense because that child owed me money okay i was farming a child for money and then flipping them off so you
mels/021547.pt|i don't need elon musk to be like yeah
mels/000980.pt|that if i were to take a break from it i would need to find a replacement it was that important and that if i were taking a break and did need a
mels/031371.pt|that was my that was my understanding
mels/018295.pt|you know i used to have
mels/021806.pt|was created for this ad specifically preach corporation
mels/023450.pt|is called margin okay that's how much you make what's important about the three lines theory is that the lines can never cross price can never go above this if
mels/006940.pt|how many days i take off
mels/029865.pt|and it felt terrible it was the worst feeling this was why they were the gods
mels/027155.pt|the economy destroy people's pensions make a real estate worth way less and so if you tank it you will lose the election
mels/012736.pt|i think people like i think about the reward
mels/024696.pt|could be massive so evergrand again this is the start of
mels/010941.pt|sheet pan parmesan chicken i have already made this me and ari already cooked it right
mels/026997.pt|things went wrong number one their website went down
mels/028944.pt|image studying abroad it was a very very fun time although i will say if you go somewhere like seoul or
mels/008119.pt|well that's big of him for black history
mels/002777.pt|the actual ways to play it figure out some of the cool you know
mels/013740.pt|i always think it's kind of comical that
mels/009759.pt|and neither of them are like that great
mels/004801.pt|it's actually more stringent than it appears it does not
mels/030586.pt|oh my god there's 200 people
mels/006917.pt|immediate damage to my my life i honestly believe that i think it's easier to be a functioning alcoholic
mels/010033.pt|six months oh my god i'm gonna have to hear someone say
mels/028311.pt|at yourself he's a legend he has a
mels/005830.pt|the make sure he was cool i was trying to balance like
mels/020098.pt|way too expensive the next computers were way way way way too expensive and nobody wanted to buy them
mels/021305.pt|the most recent one from january
mels/022098.pt|now that waitress understandably was a little bit pissed she took a picture of it and tweeted it and people they started roasting this guy and
mels/002477.pt|we need to find a way to make them
mels/021330.pt|i think if you want to ask why
mels/017385.pt|the marvel plus pixar plus rest of disney
mels/001641.pt|walking time and they can wall
mels/030805.pt|but thank you for asking live sea otter
mels/019842.pt|they used all their fallout fan credit
mels/026163.pt|making the right moves this is what fans have been asking for
mels/018466.pt|it was all i'm saying people don't have the right sense of scale in this in the gaming world flamingo
mels/011925.pt|in the full i'm going to give you the rundown
mels/019901.pt|as like this game what's the it was your first experience with any sex that's what it was i got it this game sucked i'll say it
mels/021756.pt|and my bottom lane just insult every factor of their being
mels/004423.pt|i mean we're sending a date i think we're gonna go for saturday
mels/013093.pt|sort of very supper every summer every suburb today thank
mels/027013.pt|we are taking financial advice from memes
mels/013141.pt|has found it so much easier because they're already good at games they already have games and they can just
mels/018999.pt|self created from the ground up seraphine timed
mels/032117.pt|but juggle guy that was a rough year
mels/008118.pt|oh him off of this so he actually
mels/012030.pt|is i didn't have enough of these videos ready to go even though they would tell you everything i need to tell you
mels/003272.pt|easy it's not hard to find a
mels/031563.pt|it's a chance flash gamer mode engaged his first
mels/028848.pt|and i'm just living at the office i wake up and i'm like i got a
mels/027452.pt|release date back give that some
mels/002938.pt|right now but it's like uh
mels/009046.pt|or legs trying to get into fall guys and don't want to time out and try to figure it
mels/000013.pt|it keeps walking and he's like he like
mels/014037.pt|very different group knows ludwig they like ludwig they don't always collab with him
mels/029966.pt|well this is the perfect time to type
mels/006759.pt|massive youtuber extremely funny and he most of his content is
mels/022492.pt|corporate april fool's jokes and find
mels/030286.pt|i had to deal with dog shampoo jokes while playing league of legends with my boys
mels/018857.pt|thirstiest time of the year sprite
mels/003712.pt|when they just make their own version amazon
mels/023587.pt|the greatest and only marketing show on twitch and youtube last week
mels/023198.pt|publicly stated that it will not it will it was innocent
mels/011685.pt|you know she made the gun for cutie the jinx
mels/004070.pt|the cheers such an awkward terrible thing to
mels/025250.pt|because i was banned there can be no
mels/005779.pt|i'm just checking my phone and hassan
mels/005407.pt|but when you make a like i really am proud of the marketing monday netflix video i think quack did a great job i feel like the research was great i feel like it came together well i feel like if you watched it in a few months you're still getting something out of it like it's still i feel i like that i
mels/012989.pt|for things that you don't learn any deep thoughts about it's not impossible
mels/028105.pt|we should but i wanted to give a quick update
mels/029066.pt|so i only knew curtis for another half half a year so it's like
mels/028360.pt|if you work office jobs there's some
mels/007009.pt|whether or not i'm the coffee cow is irrelevant okay i don't drink it it's empty
mels/008649.pt|i don't have to pay money the real question is whether he does pay it
mels/015233.pt|this is not demand for like um
mels/023684.pt|anything and then respond by saying pay your
mels/012637.pt|depressed you're depressed okay and you know you take it out on me
mels/005937.pt|are you more or less likely to tune in next time
mels/016568.pt|in disrupting the uh higher education and
mels/029405.pt|we stan a mom that that covers uh debts
mels/000567.pt|get player cards show up to tables individually bet for a little bit but not lose it then cash out and give it to the next person so they all have a lot of money on their player card all tracked but
mels/015333.pt|want to hit badly because right now that's
mels/019158.pt|on just what they're selling even if this ad inspired me it would not inspire me to go sit in my basement and play
mels/020636.pt|just off screen just off screen you can see
mels/000765.pt|and so we thought okay what if we independently
mels/016623.pt|know this but i think some stats are pretty stark i think it's
mels/001396.pt|something about this game show is perfect and something about it is flawed i can't figure out if there's a flaw here
mels/008359.pt|in the earth and killed everyone else watering is lucky
mels/022413.pt|you can't skip this guy go at
mels/025189.pt|even though mcdonald's has like a
mels/031407.pt|you might think i'm exaggerating i hope you can hear my instant regret when i jump in this water
mels/028882.pt|a very cute girl who i was trying to impress very cute you guys understand like cute and i wanted to impress her and she was at my birthday she was also an exchange student
mels/029068.pt|if the the the question did either you or curtis end up with a girl in the end no what a waste of time
mels/011403.pt|and months nick w they've been four months
mels/020950.pt|stop doing the project that's when you give up changing your mind
mels/018985.pt|into the day this was the real problem
mels/026789.pt|because a lot of bad things are happening for them all at once recently number one it's called
mels/027246.pt|and what a good brand will build their brand on is being distinct uh and the ones
mels/028797.pt|so i crack and i'm like i'm
mels/017271.pt|as winnie the pooh is now public domain
mels/012142.pt|at the airlock or something i
mels/004780.pt|i immediately got cold feet and at this moment as this all started happening it became very clear that he didn't really want
mels/010633.pt|with them because who knows who's lurking on the other teams but i wrote notes i wrote notes like i was in a uh i
mels/003499.pt|so like once it's already established
mels/007262.pt|right after grand finals is over and he lost he goes out he smiles
mels/005008.pt|at the for his actions in the past and he's
mels/012485.pt|anyway they all texted me after the fact they were like hey glad
mels/010137.pt|you should have known already i should have known already cats are cute
mels/026776.pt|would i recommend is going to wall street bets sorting by controversial borrowing as much money as you can and going all in on the first thing you see just really like pump it up and and risk high risk the higher the risk the better if you have a mortgage kicking on your
mels/019982.pt|what has already generated more money for disney than pixar and it was acquired later and
mels/028384.pt|well saying let's circle back on this
mels/001735.pt|so he bets it'll be like oh it'll be
mels/022013.pt|multinational brand you want to either stay level or increase your brand perception this is terrible people took this opportunity just
mels/021613.pt|the cost over the past 10 years
mels/023977.pt|which is terrible that's not a business that's like a  that's like a bad youtube video
mels/027255.pt|well as games and this would not ring true for
mels/001773.pt|talk about a willy wonka film it's less than a
mels/007796.pt|or something i could do a
mels/015347.pt|amazon is worth more yes but you cannot buy freelancers do you think you've saved enough for your
mels/002591.pt|get into gambling my friend with that
mels/018938.pt|they clearly just thought if we throw money at this problem what could fail but that's not the only problem all right i think the main problem because again what they basically did and let me
mels/030728.pt|the correct answer was nobody nobody
mels/005588.pt|so much waste there's so much waste
mels/010611.pt|oh shoot just pretend we're in a meeting you know
mels/030714.pt|yeah everyone knows that i feel like that's i
mels/014155.pt|facing a world some streamers start
mels/028945.pt|or somewhere with a really different culture to your own you will get homesick i swear to god i was having a good time in korea i like korea i love again i came there because i also love starcraft
mels/002667.pt|you don't have to tell me because
mels/031479.pt|i was like dude it is absurd how many millionaires there are just secret millionaires they just cluster in certain
mels/016398.pt|that are in the middle of all three and they have not benefited the average person very much at all there are very very few cases there are cases that exist of small businesses that got the
mels/005609.pt|smash community ee cheated on schooled
mels/025830.pt|that is kind of intimidating for new players league of legends
mels/003016.pt|it was like my adrenaline was up
mels/004677.pt|if for one if it out of a million paths
mels/013245.pt|it's like i love point crawl i love
mels/010168.pt|at the first three times like it didn't do anything right like like
mels/030569.pt|the laughing at the absurdity of it no not belly i was just
mels/029399.pt|in a bit of a pickle and i'm sweating through my riot jacket so what i do is i go to the bathroom i say i
mels/007129.pt|all throughout the flight including this old
mels/026474.pt|what about amd drivers right now let me tell you i am not happy about them that is the
mels/024280.pt|with movies all the villains are played by
mels/030706.pt|which should the south american content that's got to
mels/006036.pt|as i remember that's how it went and uh
mels/018213.pt|chance to rate okay we got about enough
mels/018611.pt|they say about it this game's
mels/007315.pt|at crazy odds they always got crazy odds it was always
mels/011607.pt|when i don't know i it makes me feel like
mels/027970.pt|the heroes over at babylon's fall
mels/027275.pt|your core parts of the fromsoft
mels/031030.pt|i guess infections and stuff all the time and i
mels/020044.pt|it's very unlikely that if this deal were to come by today
mels/018356.pt|the second twitch offers you any amount of money including
mels/029886.pt|i'm going with scar to mango's house on
mels/007249.pt|throw it making a player like get a chance to go
mels/024856.pt|these people for the killers you sell competitive advantage
mels/006234.pt|that's one thing if you like investing your own money into
mels/014183.pt|the the drop a dozen ads every hour we
mels/028470.pt|what were you doing last night i got all
mels/007836.pt|because what i was saying was funny and i don't
mels/010131.pt|yes i'm here i'm ready i'm wearing my
mels/002444.pt|you're the person i have in mind
mels/022501.pt|would have made it but it wasn't that
mels/028649.pt|so i'm just sitting there with my skateboard staring in the door there's two guys
mels/013821.pt|charts graphs and and numbers it's so depressing i i would fought in
mels/006945.pt|i take time and take stock of your life you know and it's like when i was
mels/005469.pt|and i didn't get too many of that although i can tell you this is
mels/003520.pt|that's basically what i'm saying uh i i
mels/025954.pt|where they're exploiting their own developers and
mels/016861.pt|it's the same thing this is this is uh
mels/014265.pt|what gaming app on google play download now
mels/025097.pt|hardcore fans have a very low perception of the fox brand and again this all comes from something there's large
mels/001680.pt|by the names oompa and lumpa
mels/025758.pt|this one was pretty scary i don't think a kid sees you like this rabbit if you have a white claw hey that's my dad don't mind him
mels/028969.pt|is the american military base in korea in seoul so i would i would travel on skateboard for miles and miles and miles and i would scam buses and and i would get on buses without paying
mels/025914.pt|it got extreme negative pushback everyone rose up of course is
mels/028527.pt|the work workday i get home i see this letter
mels/030696.pt|i have a quick comeback back then like
mels/026659.pt|i get your free stock check it out now let me give you a story from my past that sort of explains what i think happened here
mels/004539.pt|still typing it's not you think i would do this elaborate bit where i'm typing to
mels/025188.pt|that is what we should base our entire brand on the world should know about
mels/005251.pt|i smile and i go hey all
mels/009875.pt|so which is crazy it's the same state
mels/031378.pt|well stock for it so that's day one day two he says
mels/016764.pt|is anything about him and they are
mels/013381.pt|it's an empty flights to maintain takeoff and
mels/010528.pt|well so we'll figure it out we'll discuss
mels/012102.pt|like on day two at night when i'm sent in to
mels/018121.pt|you brought it home and it was this
mels/023541.pt|on offering things under their cost let's be honest here's the truth of the matter the average person did not have the ability to have a private chauffeur anywhere they wanted to go okay and now suddenly since
mels/031314.pt|in the back they have the cashier in on it in a
mels/010695.pt|is like a person that knows you in real life
mels/024700.pt|it company and they made a bunch of fake
mels/022818.pt|the a company so people think it wasn't going
mels/018244.pt|it is stares at him he just stares at him he just looks at
mels/027234.pt|basically kind of mad at the elden ring reviews my life is a lie they also don't
mels/020773.pt|that's me travis scott i'm out nobody defined marketing more in
mels/014238.pt|i know that people on this
mels/001705.pt|i never talked about the problem of the lazy poor i've only talked about grandpa
mels/023950.pt|what our current reality they're just
mels/000015.pt|i do not have the look i was like i
mels/028787.pt|but i get through it i get through it
mels/015292.pt|just to get the rights to james bond
mels/023438.pt|the version of the senior level
mels/026377.pt|it is one of the greatest measures of brand value
mels/019636.pt|i'm doing good man i got
mels/010644.pt|that i've been lucky to partner with
mels/004247.pt|i have you heard that bank of china is preventing people
mels/020548.pt|if the things quickly after years of crunch and i'm i'm not sure they can execute it it's
mels/026320.pt|on someone else's terms it would be on a verizon terms best buys terms
mels/000909.pt|i'm desk warming in japan watching this muted on my phone this is not the right stream to watch muted on your phone do you know what i'm saying there's not there's not enough to take from this if
mels/027075.pt|that people would be talking about that
mels/025942.pt|is this is the first of its kind they
mels/023780.pt|is around shooting people would be appropriate
mels/021007.pt|i hope this guy got fired i pray this man was fired oh money you spent on this was a waste
mels/025508.pt|to a charity in the cayman islands connected back to our bank account so
mels/009883.pt|well i get paid in euros is like right now
mels/011000.pt|they actually told me this is not working so i need to crop
mels/001287.pt|let's see let's see let's see
mels/003923.pt|that's it doesn't make sense like it should never that should never ever happen except for jeb bush though hey
mels/000411.pt|it's not a game of any skill it is a coin flip
mels/029062.pt|with to everyone already left and my mom has to
mels/024191.pt|i'm sort of interested i'm gonna
mels/019389.pt|category they had one and then
mels/025611.pt|want to different funny ones but i'm saying it's mana because it's
mels/007819.pt|and we'll do a little react actually
mels/027168.pt|i think i'm saying today is all to say
mels/028299.pt|and get heated about it he's like openly arguing with the ceo
mels/025846.pt|somewhat cinematics could have given their team a chance giving them extra money
mels/021160.pt|i could see wanting to give it the highest honors if you really like it
mels/031099.pt|it's like this like as your viewers and subs
mels/008626.pt|well employees leave out of like they don't know
mels/023628.pt|i need you to understand that people don't have conversations where they randomly recommend operations to one another
mels/024355.pt|okay the the stunt is cool and i assume
mels/014743.pt|food from ari maybe we delay this five minutes so i can eat
mels/015903.pt|if you feel like you have to have every piece of content from every platform
mels/008979.pt|with any sort of bearing on the contract it holds a drop of water rather than the
mels/004468.pt|chicken bowl chicken bowl brown rice
mels/021845.pt|it kind of paid off so let me talk about this so this is jeff bezos
mels/000656.pt|we could lose quite a bit and still a lot of
mels/005681.pt|they were all extremely aware and i
mels/001797.pt|his works and i wasn't able to look at my
mels/006645.pt|that's like that's the game where they do the tricks
mels/024413.pt|with ads for other goods and services on top of paid dlc and pack openings yes
mels/006630.pt|with him dude it was depressing either way god what a miserable game dude at the
mels/008872.pt|and they could i mean listen it it would be
mels/016271.pt|might take some responsibility step forward but it looks like he's contractually unable to be featured in a
mels/026699.pt|flash forward to late last year blizzard
mels/015421.pt|in the streaming wars hulu exists for one reason things that are not brand appropriate for disney or things that already have a contract with other companies go on hulu that's it hulu is not going to win this war hulu will not exist eventually hulu only exists to
mels/018997.pt|just drop dead gorgeous she was uh clever and witty
mels/030275.pt|my hair has never looked better my hair shined it looked fantastic
mels/030285.pt|get away with it so i sigh loudly and he walks over to the ventrilo server
mels/011952.pt|i see what happens if you do like if you're
mels/029738.pt|and okay okay back to kings of
mels/018835.pt|it turns around and then he close there's
mels/014289.pt|i want to link this yet i've created
mels/014352.pt|it's just like an easy way to live stream for normies and they can just live stream
mels/013294.pt|no you're not invited this would not hold up in court
mels/008847.pt|is way more vague they don't even they can't even specify any hard numbers
mels/013650.pt|somebody had to say it and somebody had to do it okay
mels/017241.pt|it's ahead of my mind i think my mind can't comprehend but so that's why i gave it a
mels/015824.pt|let me check keith here what
mels/014670.pt|it's settled here i have to make sure everything's set up
mels/029118.pt|all talking about it it was such
mels/022774.pt|i don't even ask for one
mels/024829.pt|your money on it should be tens of thousands
mels/012999.pt|instead of having to dread one math period if it was like math every day and you had real
mels/014875.pt|of the console wars i want to say with every week that passes i am more and more impressed with the
mels/001821.pt|do saudi arabian city well i've known about
mels/024029.pt|so that they can get all the money they
mels/021208.pt|i went anywhere everyone is buying netflix and they're not leaving it is it's like a cable bill
mels/031153.pt|i think millions after the brand deals and the you know it's a millionaire and then the thing that bothered me
mels/003380.pt|a move during the robot's turn and that
mels/022389.pt|what happens is over time you do enough
mels/008017.pt|well yeah it's like it is the first open world game where i i really want to explore even breath the wild which i did i
mels/002784.pt|your question i wouldn't answer anyway but you don't mention your question so it's
mels/006225.pt|of my friends big any tips
mels/012053.pt|i had to hold shields they had like forced shields
mels/029904.pt|after that like literally it it started so much later
mels/022529.pt|with vince vaughn and owen wilson you probably don't cause no one watched it this was literally like
mels/023142.pt|was revenue and nothing it's not just naming it's also visuals if there's one thing i've learned from food marketing it's how important
mels/008601.pt|that like helped their case in the
mels/023838.pt|my proposal now king delroy is having
mels/006466.pt|if the market downturn or crash that was that was supposed to indicate
mels/020973.pt|with this particular ad i would love for you
mels/025515.pt|the switch but what goes up must come down
mels/023679.pt|health insurance which by the way i'm sorry wait i
mels/004991.pt|why is he agreed to in which case it will be
mels/005883.pt|similar their streams in person but also
mels/020723.pt|monday good question here's the answer yes in fact when i looked into the results of the
mels/026353.pt|hi this is very common and it
mels/012250.pt|at the corner and there would be like people
mels/022279.pt|i have a trigger warning okay we're
mels/010411.pt|if the were voice it's not great you're still choosing coke or pepsi you know
mels/017005.pt|you know the deal you know
mels/009925.pt|like i'm talking about it too much sometimes
mels/002032.pt|is going to be working with me on magic that as well
mels/002321.pt|i just had this idea for the 10 years
mels/021851.pt|i have ever seen in my life like a super villain so something about long-term paid off
mels/025829.pt|after the launch of queen's gambit that's the red line and
mels/020279.pt|yeah there's no celebrities in this and the fact they say you know in the summertime when things are fun santa
mels/008413.pt|put up your streams and i see if i get inspiration
mels/000061.pt|was so hard imagine how much celery you can choke down with the boys
mels/021297.pt|the graph twitch viewership has tripled
mels/027338.pt|is only defined by how many people fail um this this example really
mels/027198.pt|you can find my account on there and follow me
mels/017222.pt|was completely off book off script he was fired people asked i
mels/023334.pt|i spoke about in my marketing money predictions way back in january uh just about the rise of influencers
mels/012814.pt|like we were the best college team
mels/031843.pt|im content where's ninja where's ninja
mels/020146.pt|it's just like a medium joke it's like it's like
mels/013938.pt|variety names because they don't want to say interest they never want to say interest and
mels/017721.pt|way of configuring the camera or extra cameras or whatever so everyone knows that you spent money on the new one
mels/014680.pt|i was seven years old when what the
mels/018760.pt|flex factor design and it allows them i think to charge more uh whether you think
mels/020571.pt|can we all have a moment of silence for the
mels/005574.pt|that's actually really cool so uh
mels/004818.pt|in children with one of his employees at
mels/031928.pt|and i don't know why we thought that was appropriate to do right next to all of our friends and again i'm not that kind of person but so so we were doing that okay so
mels/009783.pt|inflation's up high same as everywhere but you know pretty damn high the
mels/030957.pt|the show you a wonderful time
mels/022236.pt|put a movie on for you
mels/013859.pt|seen it but it has to be said this is the member list for the steam group called boycott modern warfare 2 we
mels/011794.pt|and then all you can't really see out the window but you can see
mels/019340.pt|quote which i don't know why i
mels/027772.pt|to reject Elon musk's offer says
mels/006504.pt|but on the other flip side this is
mels/010953.pt|the crisis my understanding is that they didn't do that my understanding is that was and that grew in the minions had nothing
mels/025899.pt|it's policy against sexual harassment and there was a great
mels/003761.pt|well in a gerrymandered district where they
mels/025869.pt|give them feedback for free and they thought they would just be honored to try a new blizzard game and that is like a that is
mels/005389.pt|you could yeah you could invest in the market while you're
mels/023024.pt|basically if you capture users that can only use your platform everyone's like oh
mels/030228.pt|is piss race anyway it was an impressive piss race
mels/031196.pt|so the first use of gambit was you know there's canon
mels/028352.pt|is much higher at twitch much more
mels/017960.pt|probably one of the best days i've had in
mels/015058.pt|and smartphones okay if you're the first mover consumers see you as the default
mels/020961.pt|the most arguments because you're wrong about most things as most people are because we're all
mels/017423.pt|and drinking have a ruinous impact on their parents
mels/010431.pt|all invited and all show up and so i thought
mels/008239.pt|run in politics is very unlikely i don't think
mels/002182.pt|i was hustling i was working like
mels/002589.pt|the the lesson there was to stick on the
mels/005191.pt|the video because i was wearing a coal cassidy shirt while getting my nails painted that's
mels/029545.pt|like just say what's up we're like yo
mels/025621.pt|i wasted it isn't this every kid's dream
mels/029661.pt|it's like what are you talking about now
mels/008548.pt|i to use he's not really losing so
mels/025916.pt|well this is an american company blizzard owned by an american company activision riot games
mels/021161.pt|it was a great song congratulations to dumb ways to die the final entrant into the exclusive
mels/031848.pt|in the middle of nowhere i'm gonna be the kind of league streamer
mels/007598.pt|if the truck love your content but through
mels/005326.pt|in the front section and it was like kind of
mels/013178.pt|did you see the adidas suite yeah but i
mels/024291.pt|they all drive jaguars at the end i think it's necessary i think the goal of a
mels/023588.pt|this one's a little more fun doing something that everybody loves doing
mels/030168.pt|the he said he said all
mels/022491.pt|well trolling they can put on their problem face and they
mels/029076.pt|he worked at twitch when i was there
mels/002078.pt|and then then i'll show it to the audience ligma balls okay that's
mels/004982.pt|it was like you know what big papa
mels/016880.pt|if the year olds uh even amongst all ages tv is
mels/019426.pt|of those things that is the absolute perfect and most
mels/016841.pt|with the scariest ones the one that
mels/018154.pt|dude this is so poorly designed i can't even imagine i can't even imagine
mels/030896.pt|and then i poop and my acid reflux
mels/015917.pt|what a lot of people in this past year they raised prices
mels/014807.pt|but until then we need to get into the actual content so
mels/012571.pt|and so people have been signing up with my code and tagging the
mels/029431.pt|well come on in come on come on in i want
mels/016130.pt|and we're going to keep daily uploads
mels/003242.pt|the sharp-eyed people who read books guess what there is a new opportunity for you because i think
mels/030180.pt|and there was a concert outdoor concert and a lot of these big bouncy castle type things you know what i'm talking about like irl fall guys yeah
mels/017476.pt|he's like apple companies like activision blizzard is having a strike right now they're i
mels/024771.pt|what that skin having to go to your wallet and
mels/020006.pt|they were acquired and it's because they became essentially the de facto
mels/017214.pt|if the the worst symptoms you
mels/006850.pt|i've got this trick i got
mels/012025.pt|obviously me a giga chad can
mels/023036.pt|especially in recent years has been very very very lacks about any
mels/027664.pt|guys remember but a while back i talked about how remember that tomato guy the guy who said the secret to getting rich is you
mels/025482.pt|it's a really brilliant business idea if this gets popular it could be quite a
mels/031889.pt|when i first moved to arizona
mels/021316.pt|a single individual people have the power of
mels/031189.pt|in the house is like a sign of the future
mels/015065.pt|so they got friends they got tons of movies they had basically early netflix back in
mels/010672.pt|one of the call maybe who dat or
mels/027127.pt|why going crazy housing prices skyrocketing but the hangover effects of that is that money starts to become less valuable per dollar
mels/008061.pt|how did it feel getting in the headlines oh we'll talk about it we'll talk about it
mels/021995.pt|or plans this morning burking uk as you may have
mels/022972.pt|add a little bit and the epic game store
mels/008575.pt|i don't think twitter rules but in this situation they're like
mels/012946.pt|know that went to work there got laid off and they started a total meltdown over the next
mels/011276.pt|sure why would you be invisible
mels/018219.pt|the creative idea it's a creative idea
mels/002686.pt|as you should have a walk-away
mels/005169.pt|our life my nails when i really looked at
mels/011893.pt|or even ari they they had like they were like characters they like had
mels/014131.pt|it's toast now again he personally is doing fine he's getting some good numbers
mels/005562.pt|we should just stop and get out and walk it was like very close to the house and the bus
mels/030813.pt|and i was just like wait i can do this i
mels/024422.pt|and i saw this ad from korea
mels/007514.pt|that was the original joe's bacon and eggs
mels/002736.pt|fifty dollars to walk away there is no way there is not a six in the first
mels/028325.pt|do you want to watch and
mels/001145.pt|if the salmon and you will be having i'll just
mels/030560.pt|it turns out i was not able to ask his wife i never
mels/020655.pt|if it can't go to cutie i am so honored it went to this person what a genius way to use a
mels/025463.pt|the first time or the first hundred times but eventually i might actually get a full day's wage
mels/006990.pt|that was sort of my birthday that was sort of my birthday was just
mels/023031.pt|because they don't even take 30 percent of my
mels/003124.pt|work there yeah i worked at amazon when it was
mels/015622.pt|have continued into this year and they show no path to changing again if these shows didn't do it they're not getting more popular
mels/004808.pt|are things that it's a material breach of contract
mels/006720.pt|the i'm never gonna find this
mels/022836.pt|it up again let it pass in history this should pass
mels/026133.pt|i was actually stoked look at
mels/017505.pt|it'll give you a chance to transition real
mels/024484.pt|are quite special because they aren't wins at all in fact it's
mels/011151.pt|it does it gets the job done
mels/028560.pt|did that that's in turbo tax right
mels/026013.pt|and publish it it's all available okay it's all available and it's all kosher because winnie the pooh is now public domain that being said it's actually not all available i'm sorry to call that a
mels/015556.pt|there are so profitable why not lose a little
mels/011522.pt|and i wasn't even usually when i reply
mels/028269.pt|no it turns out this guy had written i worked at x company
mels/011546.pt|is pretty cringe and there's good anime but i've never met an anime profile picture that i thought had good takes
mels/008173.pt|so there was no it was all like going to tournaments you had to like get your team and go to tournaments
mels/019376.pt|once we started to take the lead and we got closer to the
mels/015463.pt|disney's like this big gigantic titanic ship and it's hard to turn it's very hard
mels/022460.pt|greatness is not some rare dna strand it's not some precious thing
mels/005307.pt|and so you have to wait

mels/015684.pt|i think these two are so small and insignificant on their own
mels/025833.pt|the ip live beyond video games and so what
mels/018993.pt|they wasted it and there's so much good that could have been done with that
mels/014263.pt|it patiently well folks the day has come we're launching farmville in vr
mels/015409.pt|maybe the dvd would break and you'd buy frozen with the bonus features or they

mels/002064.pt|yeah i should get one of
mels/009280.pt|what do you think one ad spot here costs
mels/024634.pt|where it's going fingers on the pulse

mels/004406.pt|i did say pp you got me on that one so today we're gonna be doing a bunch of
mels/029103.pt|i was really trying to make a track twitch
mels/026347.pt|in their packaging to what it would look like if microsoft designed the ipod
mels/003414.pt|are not supported on anything um
mels/021389.pt|was the amount of shorts gamestop was a company that was right around here okay between 20 and
mels/022754.pt|and put it on this new thing called the internet
mels/012044.pt|amazing we are and he's like you can do it now without the training indicator
mels/021266.pt|xbox is waiting on halo which has yet to materialize literally the only thing that can save the xbox next year is a phenomenal like a
mels/019861.pt|and then the matrix you know every
mels/022692.pt|not making any money so now you have a
mels/026310.pt|going to see gucci fendi prada and apple they've
mels/031625.pt|but i do remember one thing that's the reason i brought this story up
mels/026014.pt|at the dub so quickly it turns out disney's lawyers have gotten their hooks into it and made it very clear that disney's depiction of winnie the pooh is still under copyright only the character from the books has entered the
mels/028941.pt|six months i lived there but i
mels/002320.pt|my nose i did not put that on right right
mels/022511.pt|i just love being clever dude like what if we made the tomatoes
mels/000126.pt|as a question they know the answer to
mels/013043.pt|it was like how because we pay teachers so little and give them no respect there's so many bad teachers and to accommodate of having so many bad teachers we have to be so strict
mels/029992.pt|without having to do any work or spend any money and then i get to watch the
mels/018222.pt|add you're trying to attract parents you're trying to get families
mels/021834.pt|little more direct you know they're not
mels/003344.pt|and i've always been like this and it's just become a little bit more hard to hear because the news is becoming real and not just me talking about it
mels/027867.pt|tesla even if tesla is a great company
mels/019952.pt|the only thing that made this a viable competitor to sony and nintendo out of the gate was that they had an absolute killer app in halo so that's why it's my
mels/031040.pt|the clean this like he wouldn't even walk in
mels/026637.pt|is the entire value of sony now i want to
mels/014063.pt|there are that and they're not
mels/000101.pt|yan two times ten months of not noticing
mels/002398.pt|so i wouldn't i wouldn't i wouldn't let him back
mels/032244.pt|our bills and he pulls out this little
mels/011205.pt|that's what that's the best part
mels/029520.pt|doc and i love what he's doing and it's great but it isn't it
mels/014945.pt|well if you don't use an accountant
mels/005995.pt|like the amount of hate they gave
mels/019138.pt|they have had some commercials of their
mels/015966.pt|and they're making smart consumer friendly moves and it's it's working for them and since they're kind of in the lead
mels/015960.pt|and i think i mean even
mels/017856.pt|melodic was i'm just think a lot of i'm just saying a lot of
mels/030496.pt|i start talking about memories that we've had together like just you know kind of reminiscing on our old stories okay this
mels/023222.pt|and that is what it takes to be a god gamer if you guys
mels/007366.pt|you know just a euphoria in the crowd
mels/020610.pt|i mean dare i say phenomenal but actually i'm sorry i i
mels/029583.pt|with all my head but i was like damn if mango thought that that really means it because mango would be the first to
mels/005069.pt|it just feels like a world where
mels/009650.pt|what does that boy boy has picked up a rallies
mels/025695.pt|i was employment history and they switched to these ads dear playstation i got a tip
mels/025874.pt|be a little nicer he's gonna
mels/012947.pt|it's a meltdown and nvidia had the greatest stock run of like any company

mels/018541.pt|trying to make twitch more profitable but
mels/032191.pt|and of the phoenix suns and i want to say that was the last smart thing i did that was right about the end of the night on saturday and that was the last intelligent thing that i did that weekend sunday the empire struck back after the cuff if i had walked away on
mels/009723.pt|vibes is for like when you you know you get like a good attitude or
mels/005700.pt|i i get to talking to

mels/024507.pt|so when you logged on to buy v bucks you
mels/022028.pt|this is again comes from i think a deep lack of understanding of how social works how sort of the group think of it works and how the immediate nature of it works so now i'm
mels/000540.pt|we all put our why in the middle it was the is i mean it's it's almost too nice to this website for bala it was it was this we all put our watches in the middle it was i mean it's almost too nice to
mels/022438.pt|very different way to say pc users are losers and i think about them i think about how like you don't have to be too subtle that's the lesson i took from this as a marketer is that you really you don't have to
mels/002250.pt|it's my dad he's professor of business
mels/015663.pt|it the most effective to their business

mels/026182.pt|it's the best our human scientists have come up
mels/009874.pt|easier quicker cheaper faster than i can get from like
mels/022824.pt|the clip of them quizzing the ceo on why he would
mels/023274.pt|then she knew i cheated she wasn't even like oh
mels/020324.pt|i'm sorry i don't know this guy he's one of their friends his
mels/007672.pt|how's everybody doing you know how you
mels/031562.pt|it's not even close to over but that means he can
mels/000979.pt|or because it implies a world where the
mels/015304.pt|if a family in hollywood now he's saying
mels/004948.pt|the dollars a year now they've made a complete
mels/008177.pt|what he did but fxo paid
mels/015224.pt|great movie you kind of want
mels/020606.pt|to get king delroy live for this event can i get some
mels/014067.pt|i wanna talk about the whole thing let's do a quick look back at how we got here okay let's look back at how we got here starting in
mels/019917.pt|in a magazine that said john
mels/028001.pt|if they paid a lot of money for they paid many many billions to acquire
mels/021081.pt|for dinner yeah i thought we would try something new that's weird it's not weird your pants are weird eggs for dinner isn't weird you're weird for thinking it's weird wait this was
mels/015314.pt|amazon really only cares about the churn rate on prime subscriptions if two percent p of people don't
mels/003744.pt|this politician voted a certain way
mels/022615.pt|wait i forgot what that says in chinese
mels/002771.pt|oh yeah one more time big reminder
mels/020201.pt|what the pissing himself a woman makes soliciting
mels/001446.pt|i don't have any wild ideas
mels/000465.pt|where he worked at twitch and riot and all these places and and uh we're doing
mels/001954.pt|if i just recorded you know an hour of
mels/026010.pt|winnie the pooh has now entered the
mels/012773.pt|i bet league of legends let me tell you
mels/013565.pt|but i didn't think about it
mels/025873.pt|there's a bug in the game and he wants to like
mels/022334.pt|that's level one we turned it into sort of a viral thing so we had hundreds and hundreds of channels do it so seven days before the announcement of the
mels/016263.pt|it's christmas they're trying to resign him and
mels/026257.pt|was accomplished in the past decade and a half if you
mels/023905.pt|i mean this is just crazy that's that's the comeback story of like any sport that's and
mels/031684.pt|in the feed while getting carried by challengers in order to get
mels/012767.pt|i'm not even kidding dude is that
mels/008262.pt|it's the connect and build communities
mels/026918.pt|in the machine someone said f not true to the character
mels/009788.pt|the only problem is that i
mels/005584.pt|because the party has like 70 people
mels/031191.pt|it's going and you think about it that's how
mels/009215.pt|sounds terrible for new players no wonder that genre died
mels/027421.pt|yeah like when you tell everyone it's gonna
mels/026295.pt|is your money when you buy the car you buy the car it's
mels/016683.pt|here's another one electronics as a percentage of total car costs this might not seem like an
mels/004682.pt|coffee cow what are you talking about
mels/021543.pt|which means they sell more which creates a loop where the entire
mels/018681.pt|us they lost everywhere everywhere bought more ps force then xbox once microsoft is nervous going into this next generation they gotta get this they lost everywhere everywhere bought more ps4s than
mels/024416.pt|would be some of you have pack openings maybe
mels/023353.pt|and this is likely a direct response to a great showing by
mels/021909.pt|i don't have a quote here but in the book and in what i learned about
mels/014834.pt|i'm sure the ceo bought a couple
mels/006269.pt|invest in what are you talking about
mels/023345.pt|gucci right he's not a generalized celebrity but it doesn't matter anymore he's a micro celebrity to people that buy disc
mels/003746.pt|a break the law and if i get caught i'm
mels/004005.pt|somebody let's look at the list
mels/007155.pt|andy anyone out of their opinions and they're often used to divide people
mels/018400.pt|and here i am playing it for free
mels/010649.pt|thirty minutes but i can't curse all day today it's a no cursing day and that's the end of that stand of the story
mels/008680.pt|it's forever is fraudulent and the entire company doesn't make sense and everything because then you
mels/004893.pt|but i'll give you the long and short
mels/015745.pt|another have to start like lying or being shady about it they have to start like lying or being
mels/029071.pt|we tell you i scrap with ludwig
mels/003692.pt|and i understand that like because we haven't seen we haven't seen good progress
mels/000673.pt|if the day we had a good time but but he lost i mean if i had to guess if i had a guest total he probably went from 4 or
mels/022200.pt|going too fast she reminds me of this ad it's like wow i don't want my dog who i love my dog like it actually works so uh good
mels/021458.pt|trade for a little but you add them all up what's interesting what's most interesting is that they were so brazen about market manipulation this story yesterday wasn't that interesting to me it was like whatever it was kind of fun but i just knew that it would end up with the average person holding the bag which is probably still going to the
mels/017147.pt|thing where i get to blow up a car
mels/026677.pt|i think oh yeah we should pay this we should get a hundred million dollars
mels/017044.pt|for that i love some shark tank
mels/020752.pt|a job because of facebook and the kazoo then this house which represents the very foundations of america starts to crack under the pressure of all this misinformation
mels/010368.pt|the main thing is the reddit we're gonna do a bunch of reddit stuff and then
mels/001869.pt|an egalitarian i think it's gonna
mels/024405.pt|they don't have good compelling deep characters i'm sick of games they don't have storylines that grab you and hook you that have dialogue
mels/014925.pt|i got the gold now i'm going to get 500
mels/006866.pt|did you play hearthstone i i did play
mels/019793.pt|in the community people wanted this bad people were treating it was like it was going to be the second coming for classic action games dude
mels/013080.pt|and then re-watch it until you learn it it's
mels/020713.pt|when they first got the monday 100 thieves wow
mels/024403.pt|fails starting with my first fail
mels/001155.pt|no i'm not eating the salmon mango meal and it's like um i'll talk about a second
mels/029091.pt|that's what it was going to be it
mels/027253.pt|it's true or not it feels true because ubisoft
mels/006039.pt|yeah yeah i don't want you to use the
mels/025701.pt|worry about games and guess what even though kevin butler is probably not the best pitch person these ads did phenomenally it turns out that the weird the
mels/032059.pt|to get our you know deadlines to get
mels/008552.pt|twitter every year has to put out a
mels/019365.pt|and i got this warning i took a screenshot of it your firm's independent auditor has noted you intend to spend 12 million dollars on new
mels/023865.pt|me that big easy reach lighter
mels/004557.pt|i need you to do what i've always
mels/024689.pt|what i'm trying to say is
mels/019583.pt|wentworth and because the phone number has cash now in it it has a call to action and what they do
mels/026057.pt|fix the error as soon as the company became
mels/009940.pt|for people to laugh at it i also think that the internet bullying it is actually going to be good for
mels/010840.pt|the and then realize there's no assassin mid
mels/019964.pt|finding nemo those movies did have huge franchises those movies were amazing
mels/003038.pt|it's all want to say about that i just want to give you guys
mels/016210.pt|what's up marketing man i got a five

mels/001281.pt|in dollars didn't that that's that's just that's
mels/023556.pt|want to win versus netflix they can now use the fact
mels/023178.pt|what it looks like in all the ads and i'm
mels/014839.pt|big example was uh stalker two
mels/028568.pt|yeah whatever like that so anyway it was being
mels/025141.pt|the copy is peanut butter more like
mels/023104.pt|in the five ingredients they don't change the ingredients they send to the stores
mels/002845.pt|ruled on in the past she has a
mels/031216.pt|campaign slogan i forgot exactly what it was but i remember it was stupid and the kids that were voting thought it was funny and liked it so i knew
mels/008755.pt|it's big enough and he did he made a big deal and then
mels/014629.pt|as but youtube is pretty good
mels/018916.pt|but he owned dreamworks when shrek was
mels/008977.pt|that's the only argument that he really that holds any water is like the company's different it's different than what i paid for i
mels/022210.pt|old man gets shredded lift up his
mels/019171.pt|leading into the promise of Halo and
mels/017793.pt|megawatt mangled banger mango had mango banger mango

mels/009109.pt|where i don't curse at all she might be older okay what do you mean
mels/021077.pt|i don't want to get pregnant right this ad appeals to that age
mels/021974.pt|that it's harder to be kind than to be
mels/019400.pt|where's the market share of every category anyway we
mels/023612.pt|you can't hang out with anybody stops her from having children in relationships
mels/017827.pt|and you don't think about that when you're when you're thinking about advertising and marketing for
mels/013253.pt|sexy without connor's approval you have to

mels/017718.pt|it's one of the reasons i believe that um
mels/001971.pt|of exciting because what you could
mels/003041.pt|it was on my mind and it was a weird situation

mels/007502.pt|well again i'll eat this so he looks down
mels/032405.pt|it's so much harder and then this is the system
mels/019049.pt|that's the secret i thought it was the fact that it's fake so because
mels/020137.pt|mood last night all good mp thanks for checking
mels/024753.pt|impact is essentially a far more predatory casino it's the first truly triple a gotcha
mels/002590.pt|on the straight and narrow path and don't get
mels/028866.pt|that's very cultured of me i just don't know what it means it means personal choice yeah i guess that makes sense yeah i
mels/022202.pt|i insurance we have fire insurance too that's
mels/016363.pt|but now investigators say hundreds of billions have been lost

mels/005929.pt|and finally finally someone has invented a new strat to counter it pop off first get
mels/000662.pt|but on sunday it was just ludwig and he was taking thousands of dollars he was running over to
mels/026858.pt|want to give you my my opinion uh i'm
mels/002824.pt|as business reasons to talk about elon musk
mels/003608.pt|in the parents i gotta understand yeah totally
mels/019948.pt|at five billion dollars i had to cut off
mels/006258.pt|crazy different ways ends the balloon menace once and for all
mels/025046.pt|actually there's something to complain about
mels/000474.pt|actually really drunk and if i don't get this
mels/014721.pt|i hate i hate it already let's see
mels/012337.pt|if the the grabbers for you and it's like
mels/024264.pt|sort of like having him be exactly like the
mels/029412.pt|paying the bill so like i finish the call i go out there and i just put my check on the thing and i remember i was just so
mels/018530.pt|with some kind of way to make money in the in the back end or
mels/003867.pt|that is dramatically hurting him the
mels/029774.pt|get their giant mugs to be like a plane
mels/026262.pt|reasons for their outside market rewards and
mels/019270.pt|raging entirely in Twitter comments on
mels/004825.pt|from this population problem back back around
mels/003200.pt|martin shkreli turned a new leaf and he's
mels/000658.pt|but i remember and then again i was a little drunk but
mels/028864.pt|i can read this you guys know i can read
mels/008232.pt|i think it's the i mean normally sure being the
mels/013436.pt|that sounds cool as hell god damn i love
mels/015943.pt|and again making a good stream
mels/008371.pt|although they're trying to automate i mean have you seen the
mels/004311.pt|what's happening uh got actually a good amount of stuff
mels/025133.pt|i like animals and a song at
mels/004527.pt|point of my stream is about
mels/015288.pt|i video bigger than all of them combined there is more stuff on prime video than any other streaming service it's not all good stuff they've got a bunch of random shows from the
mels/021511.pt|a hedge fund manager is like he goes around
mels/014159.pt|it's more of the same like like
mels/030827.pt|am a professional employed adult i don't dignify it with a response usually okay but i just this time it was particularly egregious because i came back with a large
mels/019689.pt|but answering my crazy youtube request for
mels/010239.pt|full art posters of my father and
mels/005026.pt|ap reply pinned to push crypto like some sort of bot yeah that would be that's good yeah oh what
mels/011805.pt|at like and all of the windows were really high def screens so you look outside and it was like
mels/010860.pt|in a different life in a different era this is who i'd be i am like this i actually i
mels/029315.pt|if the fan of league of
mels/030624.pt|i was in fourth grade brother i was in fourth grade okay it's funny because i think one of the reasons that
mels/005751.pt|he gets more and more dangerous as the meter fills he starts
mels/019968.pt|we're absolutely nothing it's always crazy to me that like in his off time steve jobs founded pixar lucasfilm george lucas's company
mels/005023.pt|some retweets from big account i would get obama to have to automatically
mels/023702.pt|well that's super funny do you like playing pokemon would you like to play pokemon go around
mels/010760.pt|enjoy it but i think i think
mels/029536.pt|why just like to get a feel for it right so he's
mels/003208.pt|one of the philippines got hooked on this game as a way to make money and as it turns out as the value of the
mels/021636.pt|this scene is really seen brought home
mels/011167.pt|also negnig is here in the house
mels/028608.pt|behold it led to a job at twitch pog pog you now instead of grinding
mels/022085.pt|at the break that doesn't matter how funny it is
mels/028478.pt|he's on the verge of tears dude
mels/024002.pt|is that this was all a
mels/031631.pt|and i said like i don't
mels/029840.pt|after them bobby would always put on juggle fox
mels/022800.pt|world where this is not number one i'm shocked but there is a worse one spending two billion dollars for the right to lose 50 billion
mels/009051.pt|with the tier one published dragon thank you
mels/019054.pt|is like a delicious combo meal
mels/006717.pt|the veil yeah like like and then she responded what
mels/008019.pt|very impressed i'm very very impressed
mels/021188.pt|the average money as you'll see in
mels/003556.pt|super working out and i was far from friends and so like like maybe people are
mels/012528.pt|so if if i can take a vacation that like ari's really gonna enjoy and
mels/009212.pt|i play the game with your friends
mels/031107.pt|at the time that's one of the reasons i was telling him not to be so rushed because
mels/004928.pt|see if anyone else wants to buy them they can't
mels/004795.pt|he possibly can to get out of buying this company now
mels/006002.pt|i said dude let me see the
mels/027632.pt|man in the world he can afford it he's got
mels/023398.pt|brother you've got a future in marketing
mels/026099.pt|yeah it was a good one
mels/029664.pt|i i felt for like a flicker i was like
mels/028382.pt|so my resources from another project to this
mels/027563.pt|the only reason to do that was
mels/006857.pt|we'd never i would never did i could barely swear to god just doing that phone stream with them who'd at at support would never i would never do i could barely swear to god just
mels/026685.pt|being the weasel that he is figured out
mels/023377.pt|you know more of an l for this guy you don't say boom
mels/008160.pt|if the the gaming than work this weekend
mels/002405.pt|can't get my head around it cst though that's that's
mels/022201.pt|i made this ad the dog would have hung itself probably true because they really really really don't know when to stop and the car would have crashed and then like when the family came over to inspect the remains
mels/022756.pt|in the late 90s at the height of the
mels/022254.pt|oh no he lies that we have everything
mels/003634.pt|so boomers control all the wealth basically in
mels/013792.pt|where do they come from i've never met a
mels/016207.pt|he's got a sick only fans
mels/029247.pt|as the honor and simple work and then i think on my stream we became fixated with the idea of trying to set free
mels/005201.pt|we're a video but i wouldn't do it like my on my
mels/001900.pt|it's not a big chunk of my income on twitch but i i think a revelation that maybe i
mels/030926.pt|and they're in three boxes on a wall
mels/030268.pt|what shampoo did you use and i was like it had it was the the
mels/020003.pt|i could do the halo example but again this was 30 million to
mels/026246.pt|that's amazing you know because people are psychologically susceptible they are more likely to buy things that they cannot afford so um okay anyway that's it
mels/025909.pt|the blitz chunk situation happened this
mels/008324.pt|if the had coming up yeah that's usually a bad sign
mels/030715.pt|barbaric american education if you go to american school we spend at
mels/000530.pt|i said i've always been into watches but um
mels/015335.pt|if the quite hit the cultural consciousness the way that like
mels/026084.pt|this isn't like a joke they just think that's me so not only did i get forgotten by
mels/002993.pt|or prickling up a little bit i start you know what the
mels/022017.pt|in the double down they said why would we
mels/017329.pt|bonus effect is that amazon does pay
mels/000810.pt|i haven't paid ludwig so it's as thin as it was
mels/018411.pt|warning warning warning warning warning put up your cringe shields
mels/024557.pt|or dude honestly because even after all this even if the judge
mels/014665.pt|made me so there's going to be green stuff
mels/028161.pt|one thing that was very interesting to me is that they have extremely high
mels/012660.pt|i feel like i've been out for a week plus with the wedding into the
mels/001017.pt|can you please look at my dog in your discord i
mels/021402.pt|what a bunch some smart guys bought a bunch and wall street bets picked up on that and they started looking into it and they started realizing this thing is so over shorted there are so many
mels/018590.pt|picture of a mountain be xbox exclusive elder scrolls six will this mountain be only on xbox
mels/000785.pt|but things like the watches things like
mels/011900.pt|yeah it like it takes you out of you being
mels/017331.pt|because of the scale of amazon basically anyone
mels/002888.pt|which man on earth 20 billion dollars cash
mels/020408.pt|be funny is that this guy's a
mels/019623.pt|we talked about jingles the best part of waking up is marketing monday on your stream
mels/026271.pt|look at it this is how much apple spent on advertising less than a billion dollars versus samsung
mels/027208.pt|but after release it began to get some
mels/023193.pt|and and so as long as they've eaten grass at one point in their life they can say safely that it was grass-fed all you have to do is give them grass once this is most likely a grass-fed cow
mels/022809.pt|with the company's goes public for
mels/030036.pt|wide people happy what does all boys even
mels/016381.pt|small businesses at all basically took the money didn't save any jobs with it and uh pocketed it
mels/017927.pt|we're about the rest it's it's a
mels/019016.pt|they don't miss deliverables they don't promise they'll do something in a contract and then get lazy influencers are notoriously unreliable influencers wake up at noon if not one and
mels/026766.pt|it's so out of the blue but i want to talk
mels/024936.pt|we put a lot of time in to get better they can
mels/014959.pt|the cost of this camera i
mels/014932.pt|in the times bigger instead of million dollar deals
mels/031967.pt|of all time he's a former twitch
mels/031867.pt|outside of that one boston major with
mels/012364.pt|like we had to go to the bar at
mels/026238.pt|and realize that they're not really
mels/027866.pt|in fact especially great companies in a time where money is free to borrow get overvalued they get they get they get ahead of themselves the point i always make
mels/023419.pt|are your 30s actually your prime
mels/014075.pt|what are you doing we're customer focused
mels/010016.pt|it's in the very video we're talking about yes i did i
mels/009992.pt|of himself doing it let alone doing it uh
mels/017118.pt|here to tell you it's no longer your nickname
mels/001642.pt|like most cheating times aren't one
mels/017342.pt|is on right now technically but i also was employed by amazon as
mels/022613.pt|would you like to play a game we actually made one
mels/015974.pt|a lot of debt over on their
mels/008276.pt|watch some of the greatest um
mels/009358.pt|i mean you know what i'm saying
mels/012702.pt|in the worse does law or the
mels/012258.pt|take the game was pretty fun
mels/019329.pt|hi all the time love eric by the way in a true example of nepotism we
mels/013435.pt|if i say i don't like
mels/000040.pt|the what life's about i've always said that your sub count is your is your happy count
mels/026501.pt|let me give you one more let's double up look there's
mels/007696.pt|because when i tried to practice she would make fun of me so i just stopped practicing
mels/026721.pt|one everyone else out of business become the dominant platform for for subscription games and then uh then
mels/018431.pt|maybe a little bit higher than luna
mels/011212.pt|i think about him so as i'm always
mels/026820.pt|hand over fists creators are going to
mels/029930.pt|with the matters this is a great set holy moly it's a great set yeah this is one of those recent
mels/016083.pt|and i found their website which bro you can't
mels/009182.pt|i definitely get mauled and i'm i'm way
mels/011398.pt|but i did spend over five thousand dollars in two days so we have to talk about that and i
mels/008184.pt|well as mushroom is over it's dead over
mels/015172.pt|it but what's unique about netflix's strategy here and what makes them different from
mels/031508.pt|but plenty of their moves are perfect there is no perfect move in starcraft everything they're doing is wrong from the very first fraction of a second they're already off but what a perfect
mels/027577.pt|other people that are interested in acquiring has been looking very closely at twitter's financials to see how much
mels/010780.pt|but this is a bigger tragedy than the
mels/018166.pt|i don't even understand what is the
mels/021990.pt|is trillionaire status you have everything you need
mels/005689.pt|best friends i don't know anything about him
mels/016469.pt|if some of this stuff is
mels/000156.pt|during the bachelor party and it's a movie it's crazy i mean it's
mels/010134.pt|i didn't used to respect cats nor cat owners then i became one and then my values change it's like republican dads who have no respect for women till they have a daughter like i would want my daughter to be treated like that my daughter's should have the right to i didn't used to respect cats nor cat owners then i became one and then my values changed it's like republican dads who have no respect for
mels/008621.pt|which might be the greatest outcome of
mels/031644.pt|as well but this guy was the korean translator but he didn't speak that great english he was their translator but he wasn't a
mels/003076.pt|you know and nobody everyone like enjoyed them but because they hadn't happened yet everyone was
mels/012163.pt|i tell you about the highlight of the trip for me okay because during day two i started to realize that
mels/017510.pt|in my life when i heard that song
mels/009214.pt|iraq challenge there's none yet but there will be by god there will be
mels/003280.pt|that's not a win let me get you an
mels/026059.pt|let's give a win to somebody who really
mels/003486.pt|if a full marketing one edge i have
mels/009284.pt|what comes back what do you think is a good way to
mels/030412.pt|i like four ounces over three
mels/025536.pt|is that they are eventually ending the cycle of the switch and they don't have a good
mels/026565.pt|really impressed because that's that's very rare so big big win to him big
mels/029799.pt|that's how i knew you going in but when i would go to tournaments
mels/011668.pt|let's see it looks like a prison okay
mels/022669.pt|you might be wondering why all the money was on fire in the
mels/011922.pt|if you want to spend five racks or your family does if you're
mels/020300.pt|another thing you could have done is have mickey put the hat on his head mickey's
mels/002984.pt|i took up my phone and i'm like is this part of
mels/004300.pt|that's literally not quiet dude why
mels/002306.pt|right now even though you guys already know the bit it'd be
mels/002670.pt|i need and that is all you have to give me a number between one and six
mels/023241.pt|certified and then i looked at the label and a lot of you are spamming same
mels/014712.pt|mr church for everyone to hear
mels/004578.pt|but i have to use these cursed wired headphones
mels/016848.pt|predicting all i know is that ai is a massive massive force that is going to change so many things
mels/009486.pt|this up he's got extra can blood print
mels/004617.pt|did you pay the required subs i know you're a subscriber
mels/021416.pt|average people didn't make the most money off
mels/004719.pt|the last three drake albums honestly
mels/024729.pt|have you been listening but no
mels/005242.pt|there's a guy in front of
mels/015334.pt|is good invincible's good but they haven't
mels/003818.pt|about it too it's tough i think i think
mels/030541.pt|in the garage of this apartment complex and he was taking the bike down there
mels/031885.pt|how many of you raised your hand
mels/026001.pt|wiggin dollars of investors money without
mels/015829.pt|we are going to get their news from assange
mels/028522.pt|it's jail time and so i like
mels/028029.pt|ratified their union contracts and they are now having a target union it's awesome
mels/017666.pt|you are more likely to feel validated in your purchase it's less likely to feel buyer's remorse
mels/010918.pt|what about different than factors they actually give you the ingredients and instructions and
mels/004886.pt|in america we live in a society that is extremely
mels/026833.pt|if every time you watch a ad
mels/021146.pt|public transport you're right really gives you the authentic public transportation experience you just
mels/017354.pt|i that's good that's good that's good stuff
mels/014591.pt|and live so they can be like gaming on youtube is bigger than ever because every year youtube gaming vods grow so they're
mels/025630.pt|sales way up though profit was declining because they're spending all the money
mels/026865.pt|is a celebrities also three stacks his
mels/019167.pt|oh heuristic of marketing is that if you are the underdog which Microsoft is
mels/032183.pt|by the way the rarest thing you can get
mels/026017.pt|well off the tongue so although we did get this out of this in response to winnie the pooh ryan reynolds turn it immediately into an ad called winnie the screwed by mint mobile
mels/009776.pt|with the world we are in a really really really crazy time and i think the next couple
mels/023746.pt|without cause it's an actual at let's find out
mels/001953.pt|watch the video could be better if i just did this
mels/015393.pt|this was the big innovation okay and it has been actually quite successful quite successful because
mels/030763.pt|one person higher up next calls like an amazon vp next calls jeff bezos yelling at me
mels/005762.pt|shrimp persona that is him off-stream
mels/023861.pt|that example this could theoretically be an exa an
mels/009762.pt|that's what happens they do that the rest of the
mels/030982.pt|the the gear for soccer gods dude
mels/025260.pt|you know listen i don't hate every one of these casting choices i think chris
mels/018326.pt|to go public the day you decide to do it
mels/021302.pt|amazing year because brands are starting to realize just how desperate they are to get the audience that creators have got
mels/024091.pt|it actually cuts times in half for the same quality of food pretty pog which
mels/013848.pt|it's the same and this is russell
mels/007485.pt|and tapa was sitting near me and he ordered the same thing the original joe
mels/001337.pt|i guess it was kind of fast
mels/009926.pt|what about the union of marriage i'm getting married so
mels/008725.pt|like if it it basically has to imply that all the
mels/003560.pt|but i can understand my audience is
mels/014676.pt|and then one big win but it's not a whole separate thing and then i'm gonna jump right into the
mels/029354.pt|if the for team liquid i was doing these odd job work for like
mels/026534.pt|can troy baker and there's just a lot
mels/019951.pt|the xbox would have died if it weren't for halo we would not had an xbox
mels/014860.pt|the this is a win for millennials we got our first millennial president of chile who apparently announced as he got elected that he's a swifty let's go
mels/001965.pt|yeah i did i think about that all
mels/021765.pt|funny because that is the core reason why mike myers would become wayne again
mels/014370.pt|the way for game developers to grow
mels/023821.pt|dominant so i'll watch one more
mels/016980.pt|and come back live for some shark tank oh i didn't want to recommend one more thing while you're here
mels/025084.pt|what just people that actually use the products right so it's not social media
mels/013482.pt|i'm not i'm not this bad but i'm not saying i haven't done something similar once or twice not crying obviously obviously not crying that would be
mels/008607.pt|and it's and it's locked and it's good
mels/014597.pt|would you consider heading an nvidia
mels/006994.pt|i got something i got a gift and i want to shout it out actually
mels/003903.pt|if the from just continuing to run
mels/002597.pt|i would love to hear your role heads or tails
mels/019675.pt|you know i was like you know what let me do
mels/003329.pt|where people can switch jobs and leverage that to better pay and that many people are doing that right now and
mels/022269.pt|the thai commercials have the decency to pay for three minutes
mels/031873.pt|just like how crazy impactful amaranth
mels/028710.pt|i go around i write articles
mels/013934.pt|the cost of anything but technically you can pay later technically within a few weeks yes correct technically
mels/019818.pt|this game might be number this game might be number one but let me give you my reasoning let me give you my
mels/026293.pt|or cars keep their value longer than other cars and because of that this this amazing
mels/029920.pt|are feeling like butterflies in my stomach because
mels/012752.pt|the league of legends character than any human being on planet earth it was across all servers including
mels/012982.pt|where nobody can learn anything like it's like i
mels/032194.pt|money on craps we went to a game called
mels/030386.pt|i you know so i don't i don't even have the
mels/001732.pt|fast would take for the ship
mels/022936.pt|that possibility went out the door when fortnite became the biggest game on playstation i've never even i couldn't imagine talking to a sony executive like that
mels/013743.pt|somebody this week melted down a
mels/029788.pt|as a scar and toth but the other side of that
mels/012587.pt|his referral and i'm gonna put a little my own money
mels/012353.pt|the money's worth so i tried everything
mels/026581.pt|so much less of a story if you
mels/026854.pt|ooh successful she sailed into the setting sun as a seashell celebrity
mels/002425.pt|and yeah i believe i believe his website was just defunct or i
mels/023019.pt|and they needed this to happen
mels/017948.pt|taco bell is a great example designing entirely new stores built around
mels/013631.pt|if the these wars so we're talking about actual streaming wars so we're talking about
mels/027084.pt|the deal and this is why it's probably good that we do this now when you hear the words inflation or you hear something like interest rates it's very easy for your brain to be like this i think a lot of times these terms are designed and
mels/003649.pt|for generations and the fact that we
mels/009552.pt|and i think if they drafted differently those guys could take over a game that
mels/019139.pt|as marketing who's got the best marketing who's got the best
mels/031700.pt|go into his anime brain and realize
mels/002934.pt|wait and everything i don't know
mels/021080.pt|i more condoms than you guys let's be real
mels/027455.pt|his return this may it'd be worse if you said
mels/028514.pt|and i'm at work at twitch i'm probably
mels/023059.pt|if you believe in the cause maybe consider dusting off the old keyboard pulling out the controller and buying a couple
mels/023741.pt|i use them every night before i go to bed when i listen to podcasts the
mels/007494.pt|i used to it wasn't a soup it was not a soup
mels/023959.pt|people think it's bad so it doesn't work maybe canada has found a way to turn
mels/004471.pt|beans yeah black beans and then i usually double up the chicken sign a
mels/021881.pt|with the photos that i want to tell you
mels/004023.pt|seems to be like he's very clear about what he wants and you're the one not reading the signals
mels/014862.pt|i dunno what they call it down there but
mels/028432.pt|it was strained honestly yeah so so i was
mels/025412.pt|the rings the for the gamecube
mels/014469.pt|the advice that i gave him was that
mels/028060.pt|in the world three trillion dollars plus and it began with
mels/019000.pt|to the release of a new champion in game timed to the
mels/015406.pt|is actually good and makes money or if it's only good for the customer but actually loses money because one thing disney has said
mels/020978.pt|this this article from a respected uh from
mels/014874.pt|i do a lot of wins and fails right
mels/010038.pt|especially kind of long but i i i
mels/008350.pt|it really a recession sounds awesome yeah
mels/016460.pt|i applied for small business loans from
mels/010598.pt|it'd be like oh come on why can't you go live
mels/019855.pt|can we find out who is left let's start with number five of course this one's a doozy okay
mels/021355.pt|book every sleazy underhanded trick in the book so let me show you why i need to explain what's going on because this is how most of you sound
mels/027813.pt|it more and then inflation didn't stop and but already just those two tiny bumps in the interest rate
mels/030140.pt|i think it's part of reason why
mels/030545.pt|and then he gets to the air room and again this is like you
mels/009698.pt|was before just watch the new vid bud
mels/013370.pt|will tab that means we're gonna
mels/001191.pt|that's why i like them they've been easy to work with they let me move my thing
mels/026197.pt|i think it was that great i thought it
mels/014212.pt|not the on instagram they'll what's that they on instagram they own whatsapp they
mels/009056.pt|kind of spooky time do be flying is my deep thoughts on that hey listen when i go put that in my in my book of quotes time
mels/020714.pt|get into that back half of the awards starting with
mels/000661.pt|big bets and coming back but on saturday when we did that we did it together and we both
mels/013797.pt|is the best we've got that's the best our human
mels/015536.pt|when they're in the system but it doesn't have the same impact or ruthlessness when the in the system but it doesn't have the same
mels/030464.pt|i had gotten it last minute
mels/013987.pt|is there to help you or make things easier and often they lead you to spend now they do they do work in terms of if you are a merchant for example if i was trying to sell my merch on
mels/004220.pt|what i'm saying i guess you know
mels/029208.pt|it's finals they will watch these
mels/014842.pt|was their mind and now they're removing it because fans
mels/020050.pt|by december by the end of the year
mels/002497.pt|it's not a great game just didn't did a lot of things kind of badly but
mels/019526.pt|and also when i think about it i don't trust chat i think they didn't like it because they don't know it
mels/021166.pt|boys are you ready i hope you're ready for marketing monday
mels/023969.pt|we've had situation have been very uh surface
mels/008153.pt|quack quack quack i might need you to upload mon frere
mels/024249.pt|walk away thinking yeah microsoft's really
mels/027513.pt|he basically worked like four hours a
mels/014268.pt|when i can't stick my i can't land on my eyes will not land on it it's like
mels/024785.pt|it's crystals primo gems intertwined fate a quiet fate star glitter star dust and more you buy primo
mels/030792.pt|when asked about the cello line
mels/016721.pt|that's an aggregate time of more than nine billion hours
mels/030139.pt|mexican standoff where everyone's unhappy no one's
mels/006079.pt|mad about this it makes him
mels/008391.pt|it's worth it you know it's juice
mels/015100.pt|if the the company dvds are dying weak
mels/028095.pt|update a random person with the last name ma was detained by chinese police and
mels/015240.pt|let me give you the best example if
mels/031039.pt|he didn't even bother to inspect it with me
mels/030019.pt|the already he's a good guy i'm
mels/021261.pt|you know why because no one knows the name because it's one of the worst name products in
mels/020838.pt|and you've clearly put a lot of thought
mels/002854.pt|your courts in america because unlike working for regular people it works for
mels/010870.pt|every person that's quit league wakes
mels/003769.pt|i think is the root of every major problem and
mels/011156.pt|nothing oh i thought you're going to say my
mels/013010.pt|after you need all teachers to be active on
mels/018979.pt|to make it this was the competition this was not the competition and also even if this was the competition you got beat because guess what
mels/011149.pt|people trying to steal my other ones so
mels/002815.pt|as to him on his hands and knees at a party begging
mels/023038.pt|what usually happens in these cases what usually happens is a company stands up for
mels/030354.pt|with somebody and i don't hate them and i actually like
mels/011377.pt|what what could have compelled you toxic cloud
mels/009406.pt|bro i feel like they're doing everything wrong on
mels/007592.pt|if he gets a big boy
mels/014090.pt|are streaming was like oh i have to know about this every tech exec was like
mels/029792.pt|what of yourself as a player who commented on the side like
mels/007091.pt|a solo chic main has never won a major tournament ever in the history
mels/024792.pt|much more likely to not share their losses and happily share their wins youtubers
mels/017821.pt|just because i it's my work and i get into it but if you think about it look at this look at this look at
mels/009202.pt|not saying you're lying i'm just saying it's shocking it's like
mels/014319.pt|it doesn't caught up to it is crazy again one thing
mels/008188.pt|i mean weekend ahead of me real real gaming hours
mels/028910.pt|and i was like yo we made it and then i'm
mels/013076.pt|yeah i heard people people in college would always be watching those or for computer science
mels/008665.pt|to pay it just feels it feels hard to do if he truly just
mels/011992.pt|is allied with you so like because i'm like getting this text
mels/016563.pt|what people earn by about 10x
mels/007306.pt|i was taking all bets and i was i was doing well when jim
mels/010911.pt|we don't necessarily want that even because i already have the minions
mels/003005.pt|i heard so we all get up and start going for the doors i mean i get ari ari
mels/032041.pt|i thought i would be drowned out with laughter and they did laugh but it wasn't it wasn't loud enough to drown me out and so you could see me get nervous is when
mels/026566.pt|thinking of starting something called merchandising monday totally original thoughts go for it bro you can call it marketing monday
mels/013959.pt|to miss payments will cut you off so it's dead on training wheels you'll still have to pay
mels/020109.pt|it's of that he started alright because
mels/000512.pt|am eating the blt so i and i was drunk so i wake up we wake up pretty late um but i'm not hungover like
mels/026289.pt|it's all relied around this they did not care about this or this it really relied on create a sticky compelling advertisement and then the rest
mels/009127.pt|mildly critical of notorious fraudster elon musk
mels/022688.pt|we don't get it we know you guys you tumblr you guys are hip we're going
mels/021921.pt|it's easier and you make more money from each one
mels/027284.pt|in a gucci belt and bucket cap and
mels/032413.pt|nothing in this game is harder than like it's like about
mels/028701.pt|which i've never told this story
mels/006865.pt|i didn't like it at all
mels/014143.pt|at go to youtube go to go to facebook go to mixer and around the same time mixer implodes and dies so that's another big spending competitor in microsoft
mels/001447.pt|if you're adventurous you could do like a skydiving
mels/000903.pt|somebody at him and then i could tag him
mels/019416.pt|in special a marketing monday jingles tier
mels/015015.pt|quack i don't want the roku sound
mels/017689.pt|what's considered a bad idea companies
mels/003101.pt|twitch streamers not youtube streamers twitch streamers you know why because we
mels/001943.pt|and there's a third theory there's a third theory
mels/007443.pt|gambit esports and j mook but
mels/005604.pt|yeah yeah so at the after party
mels/021174.pt|it's interesting and it's based in data so hopefully we can learn something from it i sort of organized
mels/010792.pt|which they make a morbius too
mels/003156.pt|one ios for tracking except for apple which can now track their users freely and
mels/027995.pt|well that's what i'm saying how buggy does the game have to be if bethesda delayed it because they think it's too buggy
mels/030010.pt|as do you think we i would not go there no
mels/016094.pt|and here's a short clip that we'll watch
mels/004864.pt|in the office for 40 hours
mels/011201.pt|with the generational wealth that's crazy
mels/017376.pt|this is the last 10 years they've gone
mels/015116.pt|so as hollywood steals everything away from us we
mels/004002.pt|i will see you tomorrow if you want
mels/004370.pt|i generated image of stars with like darth vader on trial or something
mels/026664.pt|let me try to explain this guy's business style because it's not good leadership and it's not smart and it's it wasn't good for the company overall but he does find ways to get paid so first example was the overwatch league there's a smaller scale but it's going
mels/019799.pt|with the great movies uh optioned
mels/006535.pt|like that it's like it's very obvious why they're doing this and apple only does things they think
mels/025121.pt|boils and goals that is the end of
mels/030486.pt|but i don't i don't do
mels/014481.pt|and i told him i'm so glad it's one of the greatest
mels/012511.pt|i didn't pay for travel like i i paid
mels/005653.pt|what the time so let me tell you i i got to hang out there was a
mels/022381.pt|it feels like i can't even see the ground it's weird
mels/024698.pt|if they were a few months away from being totally broke nobody knew yet and what they did was create this just capitalizing on the
mels/020085.pt|now let me tell you the story because
mels/010474.pt|we all have every time i say i don't want something
mels/021598.pt|today look like nothing today was insanely unethical but enron dude enron was like enron was every
mels/005575.pt|and then mischief called his boss and
mels/014480.pt|the leadership more i just i get a vibe that things are going to be really cool here
mels/001067.pt|is something you enjoy uh but
mels/028313.pt|all of than everyone else twitch was
mels/016239.pt|into the wins and fails uh let's
mels/027874.pt|are terrible they're just bad people die people lose their houses people are fired
mels/019173.pt|we're looking at are not really among the greats so we're
mels/024138.pt|well that was the peak of comedy comedy has now peaked no one else should even
mels/026506.pt|if the creators to make new things and allow everyone a chance to own and invest in the ips they create we all have a story
mels/006544.pt|his pockets and they're just trying to offer financial service products and you know
mels/019323.pt|it was like a gigantic flop these are all
mels/018613.pt|at calculator on your watch on your
mels/028015.pt|and he has started because jeff bezos is now
mels/002568.pt|if we flip this coin again and it's
mels/026452.pt|and you're spamming it and you're
mels/007995.pt|working hard like is your boss okay with the stream like
mels/029617.pt|that's actually one of those things like if you try to beat the best you're always like rotating around
mels/001231.pt|can you tell factor to make a pad thai option the only thing i tell factor is to send me more strawberry banana
mels/010401.pt|forced competition and provided a a
mels/006140.pt|i at the fall guys tourney
mels/007607.pt|and asking for szechuan sauce that's
mels/021764.pt|in shows up dude i really could put it anywhere but i'm
mels/019479.pt|so get out there and play because you've got to
mels/011986.pt|and they send you the code you can go and open that
mels/017407.pt|so not only did i get forgotten by
mels/011265.pt|i volunteer and i'm well aware of that
mels/031428.pt|you know just say things that you know boys being boys apparently the kids heard the kids by the way were full german so i
mels/017977.pt|to overturn roe versus wade which is what um basically gave
mels/004499.pt|at all times because they could always make this argument what okay
mels/009370.pt|we don't want him they do not want doublelift to
mels/010618.pt|stevens my new coach by the way i have some
mels/020345.pt|what bit of bravery are you
mels/025927.pt|the thriving esports scene they got a thriving
mels/021346.pt|it is time to talk about game
mels/016114.pt|well i could do oh we could watch that
mels/010503.pt|about community when did i ever say anything bad about community
mels/013584.pt|jokes about ludwig's dad jeez dude
mels/019469.pt|if anything that would really other than the fact that she is female
mels/010709.pt|can't wait for jimmy beast to come
mels/025268.pt|if the topic will be about mainly i want to do
mels/002168.pt|why their hobbies why their hobbies their interests their weaknesses their fears
mels/014050.pt|and so i think they've they've made a big mistake by allowing him to go to
mels/032102.pt|this story happened in real life i was there it was a pretty boring night we got high and watched anime
mels/002581.pt|or in my chat let's find out we're gonna
mels/014447.pt|i think they're both converging on the same point they're basically being forced to
mels/021813.pt|of business and life advice and all
mels/031474.pt|you know this was definitely not something you could do every day
mels/027066.pt|was making goofy sounds like people love
mels/011325.pt|got about chat we're here to a truck what
mels/023839.pt|as a kid he already had a kid but he's
mels/000392.pt|so germa shows up and wants to talk
mels/006512.pt|and again psychologically that when you use
mels/015631.pt|tech companies are just so much richer nbc is not amazon
mels/006372.pt|no way to get your money back
mels/011675.pt|one thing so ari is obviously a bigger fan
mels/016337.pt|apparently his body never needs to use a toilet because it apparently is quote unquote
mels/003530.pt|make more money like it there's
mels/025685.pt|talk about it because i think that original study i talked about was flawed yes this ad is memorable i have not forgotten this ad sometimes i lie awake at night
mels/005582.pt|well the don't worry everyone's like
mels/013526.pt|my boyfriend forced me to play smash
mels/007015.pt|i mean like hey what's your favorite snack and
mels/024635.pt|beggars on the polls now speaking of fingers on the pulse now speaking of
mels/009197.pt|going gonna watch videos i mean we're gonna game
mels/022749.pt|it was a bad deal for 2 billion so if you're doing the
mels/005425.pt|drama frog they're both good at youtube it's possible for multiple people to be good at youtube otherwise we're all just
mels/028133.pt|with and invested in them lost money so nobody
mels/012880.pt|give it a real shot if you're going to do it give it a real shot because
mels/012280.pt|while i'm in this hand he's like uh
mels/027829.pt|or revenue is collapsing you think it's a good business right you take some
mels/000251.pt|they all drove out and one of them wasn't he's a teacher so he
mels/027983.pt|at big on the blockchain yeah
mels/025950.pt|and so when you add all that up all that innovation on riot's side
mels/021753.pt|showing up on my turf telling me that they got the sandwich of all sandwiches but i got loyalty
mels/031358.pt|what you might as well like your life's
mels/024178.pt|one or two and then quit they're they're coming for a lot more and not for
mels/020007.pt|it's the for for decades now the amount of money
mels/007911.pt|one of them which is just mommy with a bunch of
mels/000258.pt|big squad we got like 10 people and they're
mels/028947.pt|at certain points it was really dark because i just felt like very deeply deeply homesick like for like i wanted to eat peanut butter and cheese this is where i lived
mels/016205.pt|didn't bezos just make a company to
mels/008029.pt|it really at all it's just a
mels/021785.pt|number one i was really worried that nobody had said trying times yet in that
mels/026496.pt|damn so i guess now they are going to try and make their own separate intellectual property what
mels/003443.pt|really like to know how it's going
mels/009122.pt|ever dumber comments sorry those were me those were all you
mels/025862.pt|are you didn't then blizzard did the same
mels/005725.pt|he was carrying out some art
mels/014999.pt|sports is getting hurt as a byproduct
mels/019448.pt|but i rarely buy anything in the ads so to
mels/022415.pt|is zero percent retract i think
mels/008067.pt|we had one meal of chipotle together i mean i like
mels/005146.pt|a video that will be going up tomorrow
mels/026632.pt|if they wanted to buy something else and i also
mels/002248.pt|and then they have elon musk who's very well in public
mels/021584.pt|stop stock they didn't have and they were
mels/013236.pt|have you seen episode six of book of boba
mels/022586.pt|i simply pause the game sync
mels/017463.pt|but the kellogg strike is not only the strikers
mels/022224.pt|i couldn't imagine me and my
mels/003531.pt|like if you have a car that works and you're like
mels/010844.pt|the blunt rotation bro you want
mels/008288.pt|we have in your pc do you delete stuff i don't really i have a lot of storage it will eventually fill up and then i will have to mass delete many important things that i should look closely at but i won't
mels/012758.pt|yeah find somebody to improve it's funny because if he ever had
mels/018799.pt|the the happiness in a way that it does not deserve it's just sugar water
mels/004871.pt|seems like a lot of the world is especially you know
mels/017858.pt|a lot of games like battlefield is a great example the battlefield has amazing trailers battlefield will will make you think the
mels/010244.pt|certain things but surprisingly some things don't
mels/006253.pt|if the thing if it's not a thing it should be
mels/012170.pt|so i get invited on my little data
mels/026920.pt|in this ad yeah he didn't i don't it would have
mels/027394.pt|yeah so roblox obviously sensing a pr
mels/012951.pt|and your opinion uh you said any worth i'm
mels/000408.pt|and over to another table of baccarat and
mels/017500.pt|that i'm wrong you know what the sega ceo was right when he said
mels/028067.pt|one between the two of you now can go
mels/029372.pt|it's a little bit i clearly am passionate about the game maybe to a fault but clearly and then they start talking about
mels/019643.pt|with the story behind this jingle yeah
mels/028422.pt|or and he didn't do that so he retired um but he was pretty high up
mels/011526.pt|bare minimum effort of getting you to believe and
mels/000858.pt|that's just being born as a baby and growing to an old man there's
mels/012252.pt|in kind of loud but like they knew nobody was there
mels/009824.pt|but we are finally picking up on it which is good
mels/021533.pt|like losing all that money it's a sacrifice there's no way
mels/005532.pt|i definitely smoked him what happened
mels/030374.pt|i literally forgot where in this messy

mels/025122.pt|at the marketing monday that is the
mels/024024.pt|what they were trying to do was publicly announce that you know the extreme end of the pornography will not be tolerated so they could

mels/005939.pt|it's so good for the sport
mels/008989.pt|but they should be double or something or they last two months
mels/009877.pt|what is a long process well i mean right now it's probably i guess if you have if
mels/023166.pt|and they add the grill marks fake
mels/000577.pt|character is crushing it i i have no fucking idea if you got know carrot dog is crushing it i i have no

mels/014899.pt|and he was hacking switches and nintendo sued him which is the first time
mels/018016.pt|but at the end of the night when i got home i literally
mels/027997.pt|i have to be if they were like we can't we actually can't let's give a
mels/001389.pt|abraham before what is that this is a bible reference
mels/028897.pt|at the bar i was spinning her around i was talking to people i was obviously drunk i was loud and again this is one of the first things i did we didn't get there that late i did
mels/012897.pt|yeah a free pair of tickets to the season 3 world championships
mels/003198.pt|who said that it's it's positive we got
mels/003552.pt|i don't think it's productive for the person or for anyone like i i don't think it helps you but it's one way to cope i guess
mels/006609.pt|was back to back you know how do you turn that into a video i
mels/031956.pt|it was a pretty fun roast and we can watch
mels/025264.pt|of nowhere and they made him the lead in literally everything for like 10 years
mels/012335.pt|dude they're just like easy mode chopsticks they're not galactic grabbers even in the world of star wars no one would call those galactic grabbers
mels/026953.pt|my mind i'm gonna have to give it uh
mels/021407.pt|you don't have it and so if it starts to go up you need to quickly cover that bet because it can go up forever and you could lose a bazillion dollars
mels/000293.pt|i got out the for a bit is that ludwig won't stop trying to play piano the whole time reviving in the sweet i got out there for a bit is that ludwig won't stop trying to play piano
mels/001559.pt|if you can get two more
mels/026726.pt|go wrong steam save us steve steve steve's a monopoly of its own
mels/016284.pt|you know what though it doesn't even matter because look at this i was thinking
mels/002002.pt|the they're very low cash to run they're
mels/027430.pt|affordable housing we shouldn't have rent control
mels/013366.pt|at tweets of the year 2022
mels/027124.pt|and it worked and unfortunate thing about that working is that we haven't stopped that strategy since and you know this happened slowly
mels/019770.pt|the product won't match up to what the
mels/011723.pt|with the full story and we're gonna decide
mels/031679.pt|is that event and now years later i can feed in league
mels/030060.pt|alright i'll tell you that let
mels/021996.pt|i have heard women belong in the kitchen full stop end of tweet
mels/017438.pt|do with my life okay sorry i'm not high my portfolio is yeah
mels/017547.pt|one disney and oh yeah you still have like 60 billion dollars
mels/007566.pt|we roasting him about not knowing whatever
mels/020722.pt|we care about sales here on marketing
mels/019929.pt|but this is the first time we had a famous developer tell us he was
mels/013718.pt|what he sexually harasses women if it's valid if it's
mels/000292.pt|with the sweet is that um
mels/021338.pt|you're going down dude there's no shot by neo stock chinese tesla
mels/024685.pt|in the problem is when all the knock-on effects
mels/015769.pt|it's not brand appropriate for disney plus or content that is under weird contracts that can't be on disney for example i think like
mels/022272.pt|the minimum so you bought about 40 seconds
mels/002063.pt|it's okay this is okay this
mels/022575.pt|if they banned dream for a day i
mels/009163.pt|the anything else before it i'll
mels/016766.pt|that was like we're basically at like a zero net
mels/012805.pt|mister global and i was trying to get known on streams and stuff but it wasn't really popping off
mels/005909.pt|it's a bunch of july fourth i mentioned july 4th i mentioned the
mels/027694.pt|anyway I thought this is a fascinating
mels/025162.pt|came from by the way this
mels/002630.pt|wait a minute maybe he has maybe
mels/022171.pt|english subtitles but it has 9 million views so i
mels/029724.pt|so the thing is that he saw the winner set where
mels/026003.pt|your fake blood testing nationwide deliver everybody false positives like false positive hiv false positive cancer false positive for a miscarriage and then if you can't do all that without going to jail what happened to this country
mels/016554.pt|very possible that weren't before some of
mels/016864.pt|year accelerated rate you can't really see it let me things like
mels/018284.pt|in the book the toyota corolla is just the
mels/022976.pt|multi i mean apple has more money than epic made off fortnite in their
mels/030401.pt|my relationship and plans are spoiled another route you find my toothpaste we
mels/005192.pt|what i was wearing a kolkata
mels/016076.pt|you just said it appears to be a recreational fluid that's not a case study

mels/019824.pt|all this stuff they all talked about it and none of it was there at launch this game was one of the most disappointing launch games in history and if i only talked about the moment of launch it's just
mels/026493.pt|after two months of outreach conversation with former business partners and
mels/027309.pt|it will be very easy for them to be like in a moment of weakness make the game easy so

mels/029663.pt|but at the time i did not know what the
mels/029943.pt|i popped off so hard that that that person turned to me and was like
mels/008923.pt|we'll use it can you guys find the twitch shatter
mels/007717.pt|and like they had mariachis playing and everyone was
mels/018579.pt|they're not going to die but i'm
mels/010747.pt|i grabbed the dog i'd grab some stuff i'd
mels/015027.pt|we just hold for one second if you're busy like me have you just hold for one second please if you just hold for one second if you're busy like me if you just hold for one second

mels/024414.pt|look at this and they're like you're behind
mels/024572.pt|and we don't need to and you know what they didn't
mels/008368.pt|the way to learn you should worry about that
mels/007785.pt|i was thinking what if i released
mels/000105.pt|someone said listen streamer and plus wedding i'm proud to announce
mels/013968.pt|on a credit card to buy an item and it comes
mels/031960.pt|so the audio does not pick up the crowd that well i was there the crowd was loud when i watched the
mels/019434.pt|the use of simple advertising jingles actually started all the way back in the 15th and
mels/027585.pt|i think we covered the main
mels/005908.pt|i think those are the main things that's

mels/028646.pt|i you're wondering where this the shirt comes in so now i have the moral high ground and i want to let albert know that i am better than him so
mels/004553.pt|say a couple words off camera anyway
mels/012516.pt|and what i think is because it's so new they probably made it expensive for this
mels/023915.pt|if you can like whatever but at the time i didn't like
mels/001373.pt|in the discord call real quick if you just are
mels/003822.pt|i think it's i think it's not unrealistic and i think it could happen quicker than people think it's happened

mels/030314.pt|well this is a very real story
mels/008598.pt|with all of his lawyers his massive

mels/013710.pt|money where their mouth is and
mels/021688.pt|good choice oh my god can you believe it holy moly rocket mortgage came through big the only ad this one was quite
mels/028315.pt|was one of the older people there
mels/023836.pt|but we thought it was a banger so we all commented on it saying how great it was and then the artist reached out to me he was an
mels/001861.pt|like whenever i talk to him
mels/009927.pt|one where i said actually unions
mels/029533.pt|given that custom profile picture that he has
mels/022553.pt|and values you know it's something that people could see being real it's close to being real but a little out of reach okay and that of course is the one where elon musk tweeted that tesla was going bankrupt

mels/015349.pt|or freelancers whichever ones of you that
mels/003036.pt|no real information and it's definitely like not not cool that we all are

mels/005642.pt|new him and i was like it's just
mels/024898.pt|you are capable of solving that but you
mels/013625.pt|literally breaking bad desert middle of nowhere

mels/020124.pt|as for your frenemy fries for your bank teller fries for that guy hashtag fry for all
mels/019739.pt|i thought the last weapon we had against

mels/006774.pt|i think i think you got i think my
mels/003006.pt|it leaves her wallet like we start moving
mels/018989.pt|and it's sad it's sad because so many people lost money and people that worked there
mels/002853.pt|the contract law it's one of the speedier
mels/017782.pt|the the doesn't have an impact on the sales he sells more subs than most people if you
mels/027224.pt|it came out the same time it has an entirely
mels/024694.pt|you see it dip a little bit i would wait for a bigger dip because i
mels/009327.pt|no one really wants to carry around a ds and
mels/021220.pt|and my predictions that peacock will be canceled this year though i think
mels/001988.pt|it's a very easy business to set up and run and so everyone wanted to do one and then
mels/010097.pt|if you like them they're not available in
mels/017501.pt|going forward you know what turns out he was right and when you screenshot
mels/025333.pt|every now and then what is this nutter butter squid game this squid game that we want nut game
mels/000774.pt|you know he'd grab a random old lady like hey do you want
mels/014402.pt|try to make both for twitch and youtube the ability to very easily i mean
mels/019102.pt|too often and for such a long time people have been treated unfairly and in some cases even hurt by others because of the color of their skin this stuff
mels/000613.pt|i think about i would have been pissed
mels/028012.pt|improvements and innovation while the war is in full swing you know what i'm going to be honest with this one usually
mels/001106.pt|time there uh yeah it's quad ball now actually i
mels/010501.pt|is deservedly illegal and i'm against the war on drugs you should be locked up for what you're smoking if you think firefly
mels/006173.pt|get up to him i look at his hat
mels/025652.pt|the squid game based crypto token which had a parabolic rise earlier today
mels/029997.pt|we got as big as you did you had like every single one by the
mels/006793.pt|we were all watching the game or watching um
mels/011860.pt|what you are is that you're in a windowless prison room but the the
mels/007837.pt|please i you shouldn't drop a joke like that
mels/015710.pt|and hopefully we can do more with them in the future but please check them out if you would like it's in
mels/006516.pt|i probably should have and if you ever miss a payment that no fee stuff goes out the window
mels/031123.pt|like the competition wasn't that fierce
mels/011120.pt|in bluetooth broke so i can't use
mels/028751.pt|it's scary process ever eventually i ran out of money
mels/031981.pt|and i'm so sorry to all of you about that two years before i'm friends with ludwig
mels/027725.pt|let's give a win to everyone in the
mels/012825.pt|i can make i told my dad my dad and i have been fighting a lot because my grades were not that great in
mels/018634.pt|and then if they get a they
mels/029310.pt|invite you as a friend i'm like dude i barely know
mels/028451.pt|well to this okay i got subway sandwich and laced potato
mels/019101.pt|if he was just himself i don't think it would be as relatable or interesting to the audience he's going for it's like
mels/024253.pt|what the next one kia's the
mels/006974.pt|to qualify for a payment plan that's so funny that is
mels/009822.pt|can go up dramatically here in the good old u.s of a
mels/000651.pt|i think even though we weren't youtube ballers i guess i mean i
mels/003512.pt|i i do i think sometimes a bad job of contextualizing in the larger world
mels/004360.pt|i just want to sit in this for a second
mels/007281.pt|he was yeah it was incredibly hyped so
mels/007926.pt|or yearbook photo that feels like
mels/026947.pt|well them as a solution showed their product looking easy and fun and then had the right nostalgia around it and then anna kendrick was a good pitch woman so in my mind i think this is
mels/026802.pt|nobody really wants to work there unless they get paid exorbitantly nobody's dream is working at facebook right now it's like their top talent
mels/018255.pt|animals always a good way to get some
mels/014507.pt|i realized i'm about to get some bank my biggest competition from my time slot
mels/024687.pt|if the the ground safe points at the
mels/000506.pt|okay because sunday hits and we are up thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars
mels/027274.pt|in the understand that now we're talking
mels/014096.pt|wait there if you're a big
mels/023026.pt|which is not really a bad thing but they're kind of trying to scare the judge and scare they're basically
mels/023081.pt|on average you're going to spend 500
mels/026612.pt|welcome to marketing monday on january 18th that means yes it is a tuesday
mels/031991.pt|i ever esports club at arizona state university yeah which makes him the first person to ever
mels/012795.pt|were formed by sponsors and they would just be flown out to events and we were on a team i was on team
mels/012883.pt|it's just it's it's predatory how the prices have increased so much over the past
mels/030671.pt|i just know how to write it and they're like
mels/016178.pt|to this marketing monday an event that sells
mels/026241.pt|they do work for example if i was trying to sell my
mels/032362.pt|actually when i opened it again
mels/016037.pt|but it's very hard to keep track of all the subscriptions you have for example for
mels/010161.pt|are fans of the charity why do they want to see you get it looks so painful and miserable yeah it was
mels/019022.pt|it's almost real right here they don't have controversial opinions they have very brand safe opinions in fact all they care about is your brand and
mels/032060.pt|going to roast material in to be finalized looked
mels/024947.pt|and order i know that a
mels/021856.pt|we've been really go up at all people might think this is all jeff basis is doing jeff bezos and is intelligent planning is the reason this all started to spike i'd like to point we've been really go up at all people might think this is all jeff bezos is doing jeff bezos and his intelligent planning
mels/028850.pt|and like a cushion i just steal all these soft things and i build like a big
mels/006392.pt|wait a few years ago and now all of the sudden they've changed their ways kind of
mels/027745.pt|well that's the idea to do that he is following
mels/023756.pt|a retired football player that probably would do it for
mels/032046.pt|know that i've seen his set
mels/023205.pt|if the to save money what companies will do is include a bunch of cheap
mels/024214.pt|what the movies did it for his resume he did get some exposure i
mels/028120.pt|that was the plan they announced late last year
mels/017971.pt|quality of life improvement it was the whole thing's a little embarrassing
mels/017743.pt|bad experience tesla dealerships are better
mels/016160.pt|i was working today i got i got no idea
mels/027216.pt|want to talk about today the main questions about difficulty because i think that's the most interesting aspect of
mels/020881.pt|decisions are critical and plentiful risk is for real stress can be crippling delegation could be impossible if you're
mels/000483.pt|and all i can think about
mels/028411.pt|if the or again in military they say landline if your officer
mels/011423.pt|let's say 40 months we'll call it even
mels/015355.pt|and so you just spend that money thinking it's yours and
mels/016772.pt|so we're actually literally having an extremely negative uh warped future
mels/000905.pt|want to scroll back to your first message we're going to learn about you before i
mels/006602.pt|i just need to make sure that i have
mels/000701.pt|this is my boy lorenzo i'm just
mels/024714.pt|going on but if you pretend like
mels/027590.pt|and you realize that trump owns a competing social platform called truth social that he's trying to prop up even though it is
mels/022646.pt|true now you can sit back and let ron do the arguing for you
mels/013094.pt|thank you jackie moon these shops noah rose
mels/031772.pt|in good but i was on
mels/027207.pt|when the entire opposite direction and when people played demos of it they
mels/020357.pt|in the back of the car
mels/018348.pt|it should get some form of stock if you're working in a
mels/013173.pt|i live in pakistan are you currently in pakistan it's
mels/018288.pt|i always have a cup for whoever
mels/026167.pt|about the sexual assault lawsuits anymore yeah who's
mels/014714.pt|are coming with the heat today appreciate that
mels/018620.pt|at to fill the gaps if we
mels/002818.pt|no way he could have done it this is a
mels/021528.pt|the problem is to hurt them we
mels/030473.pt|it makes sense like it would just i have to do it today i'll be honest with you all right i if i can talk to you know a thousand people
mels/000972.pt|well as you know i will let you know i will let you guys
mels/002327.pt|what is going to be so much fun how much
mels/020912.pt|the real thing is to get mommy's cc and those three little cute numbers
mels/015774.pt|do cable services stand any chance against these guys no cable is dead cable is dead and dying they're they're selling all
mels/026887.pt|those jokes and then the rest of it be like
mels/000669.pt|and then stands would give him you know two thousand dollars and
mels/014176.pt|if i didn't know them i would guess and that
mels/017145.pt|in dealing okay it's a co-worker relationship only
mels/025292.pt|at right into my second win
mels/014674.pt|i actually i probably have one fail wait
mels/001725.pt|and this guy is is nearly broke he's lost almost all his money
mels/024162.pt|ninja very smartly did exactly two streams in the off season after
mels/009262.pt|that i saw before i went live uh
mels/022907.pt|private emails from the other side to use to prove their case and they're getting made public one of the big reveals of the apple versus epic
mels/020967.pt|it'll probably find even more entertaining the reason today's marketing monday is this i was reading as i do ad week at age
mels/025798.pt|the show since the launch of squid game to
mels/004884.pt|employees citizens even ceos of other
mels/024591.pt|and appear naked in court and the judge
mels/011247.pt|at it and it sounded like a really i was
mels/000601.pt|white up and then i have never been more invested in a show in my entire life
mels/032021.pt|player it looks like the kind of
mels/012497.pt|for two of us so 2500
mels/016801.pt|immerse and a lot of people that
mels/018048.pt|it's i'm pretty good this is pepsi
mels/001104.pt|all the specific oh cause i founded that
mels/019566.pt|with an f for so long and then suddenly they
mels/008699.pt|the the process they did was fraudulent like that
mels/029568.pt|we used to say stuff like we we've kind of made that there's kind of been that narrative for so long but it
mels/027296.pt|it's together we are all going at different paces on the same journey we have we have fewer and fewer shared communal experiences in this world
mels/020070.pt|it's definitely not where all my
mels/028010.pt|one of them wins it's gonna be
mels/008587.pt|and you're like okay it would be financially irresponsible of me to not take this deal even though i don't want you to own my car you are offering me such an extreme upside that i pretty much have to take it
mels/015328.pt|the the rights and they're spending like another quarter of a billion just to make the show lord of the rings is already set to be the most expensive show of all time and it hasn't even been made yet okay
mels/028634.pt|of getting closer i'm getting closer i'm getting closer
mels/019170.pt|doing that so they're they're really leading into other things
mels/000375.pt|i'm trying to get my team hyped
mels/027487.pt|almost all things that happen as
mels/006912.pt|please do not get fired because you
mels/014059.pt|almost every engineer that i meet in silicon valley thinks
mels/027083.pt|most of the countries that you guys live in now okay here's the thing here's the
mels/017157.pt|i like my job a lot but i don't love san jose and if i could work it remotely i would
mels/025918.pt|in the speech about it they
mels/011044.pt|the connotation well let's keep it
mels/024719.pt|over the course of your life it'll go up right now the federal government is just printing money to keep this artificially high
mels/014624.pt|but i don't want to call it a superpower of
mels/030029.pt|what happened what is this content
mels/032095.pt|get a great angle though blood
mels/028544.pt|the skateboard my skateboard had like like a
mels/013698.pt|they got a twitter old head please please please can we get somebody new in here
mels/025385.pt|so again i was gonna originally make fun of this and call it a fail and then i was like is that just
mels/007152.pt|i know there's a lot of different opinions on it
mels/010851.pt|is cringe and then if you on on on wider scale may be team i was very annoying but for me it's you me because you me is is cringe and then if you on on a wider scale maybe timo is very annoying but
mels/000963.pt|from china he was like yeah we don't have bachelor i told
mels/002496.pt|deus ex invisible war the game itself is pretty cheeks it's pretty bad like it's
mels/026730.pt|as of steam they have to beg to get you on the platform but once they're so big that everyone uses it then you have to
mels/012310.pt|custom drinks and everything they have is like they put like dry ice in a compartment at the bottom so it's like they're all bubbling they look
mels/018501.pt|on this chart it's near like
mels/002113.pt|and it basically came down to his vote and
mels/018282.pt|in the dust jacket was written by a.i and
mels/022532.pt|as ad for google it just talks about how
mels/001217.pt|a great example if you're 18
mels/011192.pt|word in high school pay attention to class
mels/002609.pt|what down even though i rigged all these from top to bottom it's still crazy that nobody's winning the stro you are our final
mels/028790.pt|it was like electric i was like
mels/024661.pt|what's more scary is that on our side our stock market is at absolute record
mels/020764.pt|but i don't care he's actually wait he's
mels/030997.pt|in that era is the peak of rents in sf and landlords that
mels/014354.pt|i mean does it really well and integrates
mels/029982.pt|just a little different this is like a this is
mels/010539.pt|you're interested in so i i didn't even bother to ask
mels/004457.pt|day day signs and just hoping for a a
mels/027692.pt|you can get elected as a
mels/015564.pt|i hate it i don't like it at all but i'm including roku because i want to keep this jungle metaphor going you know
mels/029596.pt|and i actually started thinking out loud i wonder if there is some influence that's happening where
mels/013753.pt|if you guys know marketing monday you may know that i put out one of my favorite
mels/026945.pt|that are moving into prime house buying years and
mels/019538.pt|i'm sorry why buy a mattress anywhere else a lot of reasons what if there's a better price a better product canada
mels/022440.pt|what our values are and be actually kind of blatant with it because most people are kind of dumb the one more thing i learned from apple is the power of product as a marketing feature and it
mels/011976.pt|bad guy missions and ari who would never do anything like that is getting all of like the good guy
mels/012833.pt|going to be great and then it turns out that
mels/028343.pt|i went down to last stock
mels/007260.pt|yeah that's anyway that's the story that's the story of me and j
mels/010585.pt|okay okay and does it work
mels/006697.pt|me watching youtube they get which they were worried about because youtube is a
mels/011051.pt|all past two weeks i'm looking for

mels/031501.pt|she's of uno are too much well

mels/015723.pt|this episode of marketing money on the streaming services although i'm open to answering any questions and also just
mels/007130.pt|oh that was so weird i thought that was so weird
mels/026442.pt|the more subs you should learn from mango mango
mels/018306.pt|at there with a cup of coffee at
mels/021442.pt|if you are betting this money because it is the one chance you get sometimes
mels/005038.pt|if you've got a book dopamine rush and then in all the replies we'll have
mels/027312.pt|they benefit from brand wise but isn't
mels/022431.pt|in about saying cool people young creative attractive lucky people use our product and out of date wife hates them businessman uses their product they
mels/009903.pt|also meeting and your property value won't go
mels/016611.pt|watch it it's called um the new dating economy
mels/027310.pt|in this is the one i'm talking about later
mels/015313.pt|if they don't really care about the content unlike netflix which is a content play
mels/004932.pt|and like look at this like so on june
mels/015847.pt|cable dies the minute the last boomer
mels/027401.pt|we are they are not hitting the mainstream of

mels/000461.pt|we have other plants so we all we all go back to the hotel room but i still want to be lt i'm obsessed with it all i wanted to we have other plans so we all we all go back to the hotel room but i still want
mels/023499.pt|if everyone's got a ferrari then you're not going to pay a huge amount of money for it this is the strategy behind things like drops exclusive sneakers
mels/009344.pt|she's actually yeah she just kept
mels/032211.pt|at night and it starts out innocently enough we're winning
mels/005913.pt|they knew their numbers yeah that's it jarvis was great
mels/027606.pt|the from someone the crypto side who are worshiping elon musk twitter
mels/030360.pt|yeah told chat like almost the
mels/010324.pt|at the bottom great suggestions and i knew that what i post
mels/027039.pt|the literal flavor town is pretty funny not really up to the marketers who made the video
mels/030223.pt|this this did happen as well the
mels/006233.pt|it's kind of scary for me
mels/006838.pt|i was going to get the video

mels/023661.pt|the way better than me i invested in america by
mels/015642.pt|i have families that watch nick
mels/022212.pt|if they sold whatever he was wearing that would be the best out of all time
mels/015408.pt|normally you'd go to the theater and watch frozen and then you'd go home and buy the dvd
