data/007247.wav|and then he goes out there and plays an amazing game gets the grand finals so i
data/003249.wav|except for anything less than millions so it
data/025053.wav|the all microsoft probably windows complaints if
data/032386.wav|by the way on on my first attempt this is not even
data/020642.wav|yeah yeah you guys know how it is you know

data/025926.wav|google games of all time in

data/029999.wav|well for the first time i'm getting some women viewers yeah more accurately girl viewers yeah who are watching my
data/015909.wav|they have a huge library and then they raise prices netflix especially needs to raise prices
data/001657.wav|in that he has daughters and like he's like wait a minute or
data/003425.wav|ash point between the two big military powers
data/000701.wav|this is my boy lorenzo i'm just
data/007496.wav|anyway he gets that and it's the end of
data/009975.wav|that means you got an open seat and
data/010527.wav|ask somebody on stream things get
data/017020.wav|if the thing even think about marketing call the can't even if the thing to think about marketing cold i can't even imagine
data/008398.wav|in the nation that has handled some of the biggest business dealings of all time has to read about
data/029681.wav|it was one of the most viewed
data/011519.wav|to do but when i'm locked on a
data/003770.wav|slow to fix everything in this country
data/022350.wav|watch soap now when they approach
data/010428.wav|i thought about who's my guests
data/014815.wav|what i'm talking about yeah here
data/009015.wav|and so she is not here tonight so i'm kind of open
data/020476.wav|the years and you buy a game that is
data/007251.wav|more content i think just to get to get on sponsors like radar a little bit but his
data/004337.wav|that would have different opinions i think i have a slightly different take on whether the
data/016838.wav|especially as we continue to destroy the planet we're currently on jeff bezos will pay you to find him a
data/007546.wav|i'm glad they kept that around as a veteran of world war ii that was
data/024569.wav|they brought in multiple expert witnesses and by the end of it
data/003208.wav|one of the philippines got hooked on this game as a way to make money and as it turns out as the value of the
data/007096.wav|game of thrones torrents i am so
data/026092.wav|when i read this article was how much of it seemed to be based off of number one
data/003486.wav|if a full marketing one edge i have
data/030377.wav|so i like make sure awkwardly and thank she said
data/028352.wav|is much higher at twitch much more
data/017199.wav|and her symptoms were way less severe i had
data/025091.wav|we'll say we hate ea and then buy
data/024867.wav|these achievers this is where the whales live if you are in the achievers zone you are
data/023062.wav|marketing monday food marketing edition featuring
data/019805.wav|at the end of the day it was like it was
data/003892.wav|well i can't imagine he gets primaried i
data/025915.wav|is censorship this is terrible by
data/000331.wav|the the the ground you could just walk across it but we're like
data/019461.wav|well that's just dumb you thought
data/023304.wav|like doubling down or getting angry or trying to change things they literally just said everyone is entitled to their drink preferences everyone has different tastes and needs players are offered water and coke
data/025193.wav|there were like relatable to the
data/026776.wav|would i recommend is going to wall street bets sorting by controversial borrowing as much money as you can and going all in on the first thing you see just really like pump it up and and risk high risk the higher the risk the better if you have a mortgage kicking on your
data/002278.wav|and then you come back dude you're
data/031305.wav|i crack it open i crack it open
data/000599.wav|they have this scene where the entire
data/030358.wav|i don't know if you heard about it in a movie or a book or what but like
data/005575.wav|and then mischief called his boss and
data/015931.wav|even though she's a bit character in the show
data/018662.wav|the first one now going into this generation the
data/014375.wav|then the culture and this is a massive one and this is the one that you that
data/031350.wav|she's like well there's not much i can do like you can't i can't let you off but given your circumstances and that you're here for a school trip and
data/020253.wav|a good holiday ad will be on the on the the feels
data/016989.wav|and the the relationship they have
data/009211.wav|have played for 14 hours a day for the last
data/008862.wav|fighting this tooth and nail right and so
data/010336.wav|when to engineering needs a laptop that has
data/015475.wav|the extra money now if they were able to do it where it was like hey you get it all if you just pay the normal
data/003922.wav|a father son should never be president that's crazy that is craz a father and son
data/014395.wav|yeah i think i think auto and i'm still making it still important
data/009068.wav|i just got into harvard crying
data/024936.wav|we put a lot of time in to get better they can
data/014721.wav|i hate i hate it already let's see
data/015962.wav|for a company that to make a stupid sounding name because they want to keep their branding consistent
data/020688.wav|wow wow wow what a game what a game what an
data/016539.wav|well massive massive increase similar to the rapid increase of the rise of the internet and so if
data/018029.wav|worry the mystery of pepsi man
data/027437.wav|whoa feels good baby that's all it takes to beat the landlords back that's a good segue because speaking of not effective marketing it is a fail on behalf of taco bell and i suppose a win on behalf of
data/030763.wav|one person higher up next calls like an amazon vp next calls jeff bezos yelling at me
data/016564.wav|why minimum wage um this line starting salaries
data/025433.wav|in the world is all watching the rage
data/006348.wav|so let's jump right into it today we'll start with the wins and fails of the
data/019025.wav|at the film a dead body in japan in the suicide forest well that's tough now currently i'll say
data/021636.wav|this scene is really seen brought home
data/023323.wav|i outside of a club and hassan and i were waiting the guy asked us for a photo
data/005925.wav|it's a little bit wants to get that option back on the table he's worried about just misfacing lasers even so slightly
data/020544.wav|in the farther out and so i'm very worried that
data/029594.wav|in the community very recently is i feel like
data/015584.wav|absolutely cheap stuff and that brings us back to our favorite company
data/006190.wav|and then i'll take a picture with you
data/000404.wav|it's a really slow game it takes
data/014659.wav|can you do one right now
data/000057.wav|i have like three fourths of a
data/021905.wav|it up really late again and
data/021352.wav|i am changing my tune normally i would be saying i told
data/018616.wav|when netflix first started okay netflix was dvd by mail delivery service and when they started streaming it was all other people's content okay they had friends they had the office they had
data/022681.wav|if millennials which at the time
data/014202.wav|if the a model it's not exact numbers it's a
data/028005.wav|it's actually pretty good they do have a decent
data/023234.wav|the sugary it's dessert basically this
data/031284.wav|but he asked me how i got in i tell him the truth i tell
data/008421.wav|those was finally one find me one find me an
data/011479.wav|because the creative director had a crush on her moved across the crunchy and broke up with me because the creative director had a crush on her moved across the country and broke up with me
data/002475.wav|but they were inventing like loyalty
data/028139.wav|because they weren't public in time and the financial forecast is much much darker than they originally promised they still have income they don't actually make money because they spend
data/027268.wav|and they do things differently they have different
data/014423.wav|for to these companies amazon and
data/005280.wav|ask him to i don't care i didn't
data/019289.wav|that is all of it well let me just say
data/012503.wav|is that made me a lot more than 5k
data/012737.wav|it always gives you reward so you work hard in wow or anything
data/004921.wav|on his promise so they froze hiring people started leaving and
data/011142.wav|never make fun of your board look
data/002181.wav|legitimately was very very very it was just like dude
data/017864.wav|is how you can build your brand and stand out in the gaming world and people only focus on this and this is the only this is like the best way to trick consumers and this is the best way to get them to become
data/007656.wav|we've been working on it so
data/031115.wav|where neither of us knew the stars and so it took all saturday but we tried to erase it but none of us
data/020639.wav|we got ninja the blood himself i mean
data/010236.wav|he himself at his own backyard and he's not back flipping in front of the office i work at it's like that's progress we're making progress
data/006972.wav|wall street bets is like okay the
data/014391.wav|and it makes it very hard to switch because you know your community be lost but now what if that was easy what if
data/022135.wav|it's a miserable thankless job corporate emails are the worst so it's a miserable job i remember
data/010313.wav|sleepy joe is cracked on the sticks well i don't think i should call
data/004872.wav|it's jobs are moving towards more remote friendly options
data/025796.wav|one hundred percent and the audience scores 99
data/022643.wav|if you're like me you love talking about
data/007842.wav|put that clip in yeah you might be had for some for put that clip in yeah you might be headed for some for some ds
data/028645.wav|i feel amazing okay now that's that's
data/002359.wav|let me write that down wedding guest
data/001402.wav|when people cheat on online stream based trivia i hate it
data/028611.wav|i would have been at best bottom tier lcs until i got kicked
data/017859.wav|in the beautiful game that's so fun and then you buy it and the
data/010048.wav|to the task you don't even wear a mask so
data/007570.wav|you know i might watch it on stream
data/003274.wav|this one for example is a win on the concept of third chances because
data/010140.wav|in the cat it's not the nvidia geforce rt
data/009291.wav|what's the everything so it's very difficult to escape them and then
data/006554.wav|the one that makes kind of any sense um
data/015755.wav|the the general philosophy was that everyone would be like netflix and if
data/013161.wav|i can't wait to play that with my chat
data/029007.wav|i could easily do it you couldn't beat mango yes i could dude
data/010592.wav|and we sing the same song with the same power we can be bigger than these struggles
data/016261.wav|this is so dirty to malik monk
data/020750.wav|and then education altogether getting the entire country screaming noise at each other instead of any meaningful dialogue
data/029548.wav|it's great okay like get excited people
data/017133.wav|keep it of course with the 20 months
data/014171.wav|we can start to get over the audience does that
data/011031.wav|yes i do sphinx king you specifically sphinx
data/002776.wav|to figure it out live so we're
data/016687.wav|car is going to be electronics and what that means is people that design for the future of cars are primarily going to be more
data/019477.wav|it's a marketer's dream you come up with
data/025678.wav|but it was not effective for the
data/010214.wav|as i wouldn't be talking to you um and
data/002630.wav|wait a minute maybe he has maybe
data/017736.wav|and value rather than having again a better
data/024675.wav|these companies similar to what america did in
data/032379.wav|by the way if anyone saw i went accidentally
data/003857.wav|it right now this is this is gonna explode like no
data/007159.wav|bigger problems that is how i that's my general opinion so if you
data/025011.wav|so what the united states you know what i
data/032025.wav|most of my good friend bobby scar i didn't
data/000347.wav|cover we have to wear a big heavy backpack
data/016575.wav|getting more and more valuable this is
data/011748.wav|it is good as the actors but they're they're
data/016965.wav|the think you can use it that's my last opinion um
data/007818.wav|will do wins it fails today and we'll do wins and fails today
data/001409.wav|well join up if you're not expecting to
data/028794.wav|at the time she goes so you're not
data/030386.wav|i you know so i don't i don't even have the
data/020745.wav|it's a bad in january is truly impressive but what i think is extra based about this ad
data/009961.wav|will be disappointed but who cares i'll have content
data/004395.wav|we're a letter first of all you don't need it in twitter is this
data/013380.wav|wants to make up for this brussels airline runs three thousand
data/019383.wav|just to steal more market share so
data/007130.wav|oh that was so weird i thought that was so weird
data/015546.wav|they don't really care about the content the
data/008718.wav|the damage so to speak and like try to rewind everything to before elon musk got involved which means him paying a lot of money to twitter and then him walking away
data/024950.wav|well quotes from the comments of that video that i thought were interesting this person named depression said when i first saw this video two years ago i
data/018560.wav|because to make up the cost of getting everything exclusive
data/029702.wav|one more and he sits up for one second
data/008405.wav|at curse i cannot promise that and
data/031973.wav|it's like that's that's hbox and his crew going
data/012018.wav|the both of us and we'd go together so we went to like the bridge together and learned bridge training how to fly a ship and then oh my god
data/026620.wav|the billion all cash deal there are only like four companies on earth that have
data/026363.wav|well branding to call to call it a genius bar
data/010142.wav|i jumped up my lap curl
data/020248.wav|is he has a lot of positive associations so basically
data/006601.wav|i have one more sorry i have um
data/026522.wav|people that love you from gaming and they they just hate
data/015507.wav|at number one baby that's apple also
data/029161.wav|the package to find the most full batteries and
data/008636.wav|they have a lot of employees leaving
data/015642.wav|i have families that watch nick
data/021234.wav|the growth rate has been absolutely phenomenal it did not get shut down
data/008532.wav|if they make like chicken fingers
data/029481.wav|worry i think full with a lot of up and downs
data/028118.wav|be the first billion dollar esports company
data/026488.wav|the the go from here does anyone know let's see
data/014546.wav|a young otto's got many years
data/024147.wav|in a half there's been a bit of a lull where
data/015853.wav|what do you think about amazon and netflix
data/006017.wav|what i wanted to say i wanted to say is that
data/031603.wav|the food was the free food the snacks in the press room at dreamhack it was like coca-cola bottles
data/027354.wav|we used to think about a way
data/021237.wav|i want to ask you guys if you look at this picture what do you see not just girl gamers
data/010280.wav|one with the headphone cord oh
data/018469.wav|where was that particular little message
data/014431.wav|we're going to get bigger and it's going to be a major way we consume content for the next five six years and
data/008775.wav|guy from columbia university clinton said musk's argument will probably guy from columbia university quinn said musk's argument would probably fail in
data/002916.wav|because they knew it was like they could get the widest possible audience the
data/013412.wav|good thing whether they're making fun of my voice or not
data/009792.wav|so they can't get natural gas from russia which is a good thing i mean it's good that they're having some economic sanction to
data/008790.wav|so it's that's where it becomes really
data/020572.wav|who are on their 50th cup of coffee
data/025270.wav|in that is to the the chuckle over at netflix i'm sick of netflix forcing me to watch whatever their flavor of the month
data/008938.wav|get nothing just as a penalty that's so much money for nothing
data/015156.wav|the most google thing ever i think it was so successful that yeah it was successful it was
data/015351.wav|was actually because they don't have the
data/021722.wav|ak system is so complicated it's complicated because of you
data/002805.wav|things off with wins and fails and i want to start off by giving a big big big sad fail to the concept of lost friendship now have you
data/000130.wav|while let me tell you what happened at the bachelor party it was very fun
data/025574.wav|i posted on twitter and most importantly i got thousands of likes the good thing about getting that prediction right
data/001942.wav|bro are you beta spending time with your wife is
data/004748.wav|it's okay so he was paying about a six dollar premium per share
data/005909.wav|it's a bunch of july fourth i mentioned july 4th i mentioned the
data/005618.wav|get it because we're way past it and let me
data/015747.wav|if the people which means if you add that up and carry the one and our next
data/023470.wav|fat chunk of cash on every car sold and that's
data/004769.wav|and at the same time the big elephant in the room started happening which was
data/006422.wav|you open up the elder chains online and feel a rush of excitement your buddy from school
data/011039.wav|well you guys don't know if it's good or bad
data/025075.wav|and guaranteed and it's the exact
data/003446.wav|half or more of all the world's chips come from and i'm not talking about lays i'm talking about
data/010128.wav|the last one sounds like we're parting and if so it was a pleasure and
data/010254.wav|which when i say it like that sounds like a bad
data/029744.wav|cause you could actually do it like a one of
data/025695.wav|i was employment history and they switched to these ads dear playstation i got a tip
data/001599.wav|i mean people who else shake drizzle lyrics editor
data/021311.wav|it has a gigantic cast a network behind it and a team of ad sales all of that
data/009261.wav|let's do a quick check in on this
data/026617.wav|if the for two and a half billion dollars was a crazy big deal in case you're wondering this one is bigger than all of these combined it is also not just one of the biggest
data/011078.wav|in the temp files or something it would not open kind of a you know
data/021839.wav|was how much he emphasized thinking about the
data/003041.wav|it was on my mind and it was a weird situation
data/031779.wav|i have never what is s 3k
data/001035.wav|i have thoughts in the back and
data/028955.wav|homesick oh oh also at one point
data/011007.wav|wall guys if there's a squad for fall guys i can do that
data/012055.wav|was the worst part there's plenty of parts that i liked the
data/016309.wav|one warehouse number one buy a mile
data/011515.wav|is kind of a researched and bold stance that if you look at the data they
data/002754.wav|have a more deserving person for this
data/009791.wav|we are giving quotas on when residents can use hot water this is all because
data/021047.wav|if the smiley face because it's steve our own
data/017772.wav|say in my stream that he will actually read
data/017938.wav|and then get your cut of the nfl
data/014379.wav|this is like the these three things i think are what keeps twitch in the lead
data/031492.wav|in starcraft are unlike any other game
data/001635.wav|although cheaters have already shown up unfortunately if you look at the leaderboards today there's already cheated records on there there's a
data/017548.wav|that is the current valuation of apple is all of that stuff combined apple is phenomenally phenomenally outside successful these are all
data/010079.wav|the meals are delicious uh they're
data/016039.wav|way again for the sponsor now i'm gone and now i am exhausted i hope you enjoyed i'll let you know way again for the sponsor now i'm done and now i'm exhausted
data/000146.wav|no good outcome there is no
data/027539.wav|with that in mind my initial gut reaction to this is that i'm positive because it can't get worse
data/004928.wav|see if anyone else wants to buy them they can't
data/032134.wav|but a battle was lost listen i
data/006837.wav|actually going crazy with it actually going nuts with it
data/016900.wav|is at all time highs and it's growing
data/001307.wav|in overdo it but it starts to become fake like you know the more money there is in having a hit prank video the more
data/004647.wav|sorry to bother you only just
data/031189.wav|in the house is like a sign of the future
data/005003.wav|well have already left they're gonna have them
data/022596.wav|get back to playing the game on your ps4
data/021395.wav|essentially it's called a naked short when you sell it before you've even borrowed it you're making a promise to sell it and that only works if it guarantees goes down it's called a naked short so
data/004785.wav|it could just walk away and as we remember from his first tweet that i just showed
data/005441.wav|specifically i mean some of these are fine but this one specifically
data/024813.wav|lot of getting it and then do it again to level
data/014839.wav|big example was uh stalker two
data/019102.wav|too often and for such a long time people have been treated unfairly and in some cases even hurt by others because of the color of their skin this stuff
data/022972.wav|add a little bit and the epic game store
data/029010.wav|is a week mango drinks every day
data/002425.wav|and yeah i believe i believe his website was just defunct or i
data/006676.wav|it's so it's a it's like instant dopamine play with sound off i wouldn't enjoy it
data/023476.wav|but in the end it's all they're both trying to raise this perceived value so
data/018365.wav|just the thing i do all the time i'm not sure if it's the perfect answer but in general my advice is always include hey i'm happy here i love this place
data/006219.wav|well be excited in that way for marketing
data/001155.wav|no i'm not eating the salmon mango meal and it's like um i'll talk about a second
data/007405.wav|a ton of my negative associations with the scene vanished when i hang out with real life
data/001194.wav|not be bored that's the plan um get smarter
data/014095.wav|with this hero now to the average person maybe ninja is not a hero but if you are a content creator there is nobody more
data/020098.wav|way too expensive the next computers were way way way way too expensive and nobody wanted to buy them
data/027253.wav|it's true or not it feels true because ubisoft
data/013038.wav|i'll be the good one to balance
data/023298.wav|we're a day it died after a day
data/003462.wav|not part of china and so it could lead to military conflict
data/025281.wav|the global this popular every country all over the world it's the biggest hit possibly outside of stranger things that netflix has ever had and so
data/030645.wav|if the if you get a question wrong you
data/012259.wav|so so this kid who i didn't even like i wasn't even particularly nice to
data/010596.wav|that's funny because this is literally my old time that i normally did every day until i started getting really busy and so all the
data/027940.wav|can follow investors if you want to see what
data/031676.wav|and then by the end of it i'm like fully
data/004424.wav|so there's a very real chance that this saturday we will have a scrub daddy millionaire a shark tank millionaire on the broadcast talk about what it was like pitching and maybe even watch a little
data/017996.wav|is deeply unpopular on the whole
data/030003.wav|one month you've got like a bunch of eight
data/002008.wav|that like i like everything but the boba you know just take the boba out and i love it it's like the
data/001239.wav|but that doesn't mean you could not run a brand account people
data/015500.wav|disney prints money with theme parks it's because
data/011759.wav|they're like oh is that from the outer rim
data/012077.wav|and there's not that much to do it's
data/032254.wav|it's like and he flips over one card and it's
data/022906.wav|a lot of private emails are getting brought public both sides are able to um request
data/004318.wav|did i imply in any way that steve carell
data/024811.wav|impact there is so much more than that
data/027010.wav|it would just rate is really highly so i'm interested if it was
data/008194.wav|i did think i would add a little energy
data/007986.wav|i crazy but honestly this is wrong
data/025588.wav|i can't wait to play this that was
data/000835.wav|inter with eight guys from craigslist one of them smoked crack at
data/021541.wav|of tesla and also you're shorting gamestop if you
data/027819.wav|the crash so at the point i'm trying to make is that i looked at the data and retail investors which is what you and i are the crash so and the point i'm trying to make is that uh i looked at the data
data/016351.wav|little serious i want to give what i think might be the biggest fail the biggest actual literal fail i've ever given
data/009305.wav|knows that stop them from like targeting children they don't apply to like the exact same things but better and
data/019954.wav|it's a fantastic acquisition number nine number nine greatest acquisition of all time disney buys pixar do you remember the movie brother bear you might not whether or not you know these films
data/008752.wav|a lot of me's and there's also
data/028456.wav|just reading my book macking on my subway sandwich
data/018846.wav|if voted this of 5 it is very weird even you know
data/005969.wav|well no that's that's the meme but
data/010077.wav|no have tried factored from this and they
data/022020.wav|it's a matter of time it's literally like jack
data/016263.wav|it's christmas they're trying to resign him and
data/003282.wav|okay this one's about protests all over ecuador because of a spike in prices for food and fuel that sounds depressing i'm
data/018220.wav|but he's also the cheapest of the of that cast and it makes perfect sense they would hire him and save money
data/031773.wav|but if there's ever a day you know that i could contribute a little bit of the lore maybe i
data/009490.wav|it's printed from his deaths but still that
data/021133.wav|we genius but i think it's actually just cringe and it looks like the votes agree cringe taco john's yes we'll do another submission from ari she wants to talk about taco john's from
data/024788.wav|is but they'll have different denominations so that's why things will be costed like
data/006293.wav|it's like that wait let me update my
data/017977.wav|to overturn roe versus wade which is what um basically gave
data/017948.wav|taco bell is a great example designing entirely new stores built around
data/006980.wav|and you know sometimes you don't get the
data/001850.wav|and i don't know if they have it or if
data/028541.wav|in the car ride a skateboard i didn't have a car so i had to skateboard i
data/023975.wav|during the peak of only fans hysteria
data/019967.wav|then they they warm up to it they start going through ideas and then seven billion reasons later which is the purchase price they got pixar making steve jobs absolutely insanely wealthy because he bought
data/032055.wav|that was just an inside joke for
data/026809.wav|for companies are so big five companies basically that only they can really compete with each other smaller companies have a hard time
data/011792.wav|and it looks like you're taking off
data/030313.wav|i did the full and then sorry i'm laughing at something else but
data/011689.wav|well that makes fun of it i'm not gonna
data/013511.wav|imagine a human city called manchester
data/000653.wav|even though we weren't youtube ballers
data/027274.wav|in the understand that now we're talking
data/005505.wav|there was nothing i mean there was nothing that you're
data/024605.wav|get stage ladies and gentlemen the future his truck resume had two trucks come on stage behind me next when this is an get on stage ladies and gentlemen the future is truck
data/012433.wav|it's kind of cool this is where the
data/000122.wav|did you end up losing your voice a bit we say
data/017274.wav|nude he be your poo is free
data/009464.wav|which time he's not going to weave in autos put him on goddamn thresh again and just
data/019410.wav|they would have outvoted me right here when we got this warning and they would have said no we can't do it or they would have gone to the teacher but because it was only jason i was able to convince him let's can go
data/005347.wav|and hassan comes in and he's like two three rows ahead of me okay hassan's like two
data/027545.wav|do you think they'll get back to these heights and more even though these were kind of
data/026452.wav|and you're spamming it and you're
data/003405.wav|and piece of news that i'd
data/007812.wav|give you one more day because it really is almost done i just want to like polish a few slides add a few like little
data/010918.wav|what about different than factors they actually give you the ingredients and instructions and
data/019195.wav|and also get back at Nintendo launched
data/001367.wav|if the thing and then i was gonna give you
data/021219.wav|got next year guns blazing i think
data/032257.wav|if the way this guy he slow
data/032169.wav|the chip stack so he gives me a
data/015007.wav|with the about that what's up
data/014003.wav|about some more failed business hats blockbusters lawyers
data/003514.wav|i i can't pretend like this is like a great period but
data/021785.wav|number one i was really worried that nobody had said trying times yet in that
data/007015.wav|i mean like hey what's your favorite snack and
data/018447.wav|they keep a small number of employees who are all filthy rich and they work slowly i think steam could win this or what could be really interesting
data/017968.wav|on sunday because i literally did
data/025335.wav|a third fail no actually let's
data/009576.wav|i have played for 10 years
data/019581.wav|the the greatest jingles because not only is it memorable not only
data/028972.wav|because they were living in germany
data/010222.wav|they just kind of walked in and saw that
data/003198.wav|who said that it's it's positive we got
data/009431.wav|it's to see what they're saying
data/030163.wav|so he throws his keyboard out he goes upstairs to nipper's computer
data/028027.wav|with tons of views in fact i'll give a win
data/012421.wav|as the party and he starts fighting rey and they're
data/023346.wav|it's golf stuff and so a disc golf manufacturer will pay him almost any amount of money because they target the exact market they want it's it's a win for both and so
data/001627.wav|parentheses i'm lying and that's from my editor that's quack who edited it that's not i don't think that's
data/017564.wav|a company that's way smaller than apple
data/012624.wav|so soon i cannot wait for daily
data/015144.wav|is gone like 20 billion dollars into debt
data/020210.wav|have it published on the website then vote on the best one and it will become an official item on
data/024510.wav|if you have to give us our
data/013837.wav|about their exclusive like their weird belief
data/005097.wav|the for your viewing pleasure so let's check out
data/022902.wav|it's such a weak mindset okay
data/005831.wav|the morals and being a good friend it was tough
data/029385.wav|eventually for your first time but i who
data/012314.wav|well you know like the food was not um
data/001350.wav|i wouldn't have planned the wedding if it was still in the air if it was still
data/005867.wav|if the first time usually a nice funny
data/019985.wav|i was doing great in animation we're doing
data/011004.wav|if there's no boss then what should i do as a challenge and i can't do a
data/017198.wav|i maybe i'll cough again i just got over it but
data/025637.wav|well it's student loans got married and bought a house in
data/022196.wav|they saved it they brought it home
data/027039.wav|the literal flavor town is pretty funny not really up to the marketers who made the video
data/024683.wav|what i am worried about is if this does continue for
data/009773.wav|what's the house anything in the news what's what's what's the what's what's the vibe
data/022476.wav|about the world if other sports were treated like skaters i think it was just like a good lesson for me as a marketer on how how important
data/013271.wav|we need to watch it i have not seen it nope nope
data/017257.wav|and that's what i'll say so this is a fail
data/000993.wav|no matter when you were born during a year new years is your birthday think about that or january
data/018265.wav|yeah listen you generally don't want to do commercials about dying pets you also don't generally don't want to do commercials about suicide you also generally don't want the commercials about pet necromancy cats getting mauled by
data/028949.wav|yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah this big hill and what i would do
data/008890.wav|world's richest man having 10 kids having three
data/007445.wav|know that was mostly all of
data/029157.wav|by the way the double a's back then
data/015854.wav|yeah i think that's very interesting i didn't want to include it in this because it's kind of outside of the scope of the streaming wars but it's very interesting because netflix has started to see its competition not
data/015423.wav|the services as one bundle for the same price as netflix you can buy all three of them i
data/018284.wav|in the book the toyota corolla is just the
data/012940.wav|like if you if you do it well enough you can get it can spread virally
data/000501.wav|like a chipmunk right here over the t i just
data/022949.wav|i'm not at that level in my career i could never imagine talking to another company's like top executives and being
data/026609.wav|i know because i've worked with ludwig
data/030546.wav|work parking garage you open up a door you're in a sealed underground room full of bikes there's bike racks and an air
data/027411.wav|it's straightforward free seamless process many countries already do this they were the models that our government was looking
data/031982.wav|i found out this day that he was unfiltered
data/014054.wav|human being and as someone who worked you know at twitch for example and saw dev teams
data/031502.wav|but outside of that i mean we don't even it's like it's like rank zero we don't
data/027491.wav|a media company but what i think was a very very good take that sort of
data/021781.wav|why it's so horny you don't really i mean this is not something alexa can actually
data/004364.wav|said exactly what i was thinking
data/031213.wav|what the corporation keep that in mind it'll come in handy later i a young 17 year old
data/029762.wav|i am in my twitch days i am so glad i went to europe a couple
data/026706.wav|and i remember thinking it's so weird it's so weird they're
data/024680.wav|crypto is almost certainly at least for the foreseeable
data/001491.wav|i gotta say though this seems a little
data/022916.wav|i was under the impression there was no movement with microsoft either
data/023653.wav|there'll be a different kid and they look up at the sky
data/006113.wav|as like nine sets one of his biggest opponents uh in a big tournament
data/015303.wav|it used to be owned by the
data/022035.wav|but i felt bad because uh the guy posted
data/006569.wav|worth it because we all know that the
data/032213.wav|i yet we want to make it last and then
data/004991.wav|why is he agreed to in which case it will be
data/011224.wav|invite him to this game yeah
data/010275.wav|pulled it down and then crawled inside
data/002200.wav|is that are anywhere close to reliable so i just uh i use my stream budget
data/031680.wav|in the league of legends with miz kif
data/025674.wav|it could get your brand in trouble as in this
data/002162.wav|people love that just make it long
data/029609.wav|it's uh the action of attacking or
data/004948.wav|the dollars a year now they've made a complete
data/002688.wav|we're looking for a six though
data/007012.wav|of coffee he got me a giant venti phil's coffee and it was so
data/016066.wav|and he saw potential in video
data/025996.wav|i eating ass that's a big deal congrats to pbr for
data/006990.wav|that was sort of my birthday that was sort of my birthday was just
data/012144.wav|you and she's like incredibly nice
data/011041.wav|move to a new city and and you're dating
data/009766.wav|in what way in like a way where she doesn't
data/032096.wav|in his legs were wide open kind of like they are now he does that all the time i haven't seen anyone spread their
data/001393.wav|we didn't from the server i didn't want to do that i didn't want to do that wasn't a good one chad that wasn't a good one he said
data/000267.wav|and we're having a good time we're all gaming we all we all
data/017443.wav|i never got invited i did
data/031339.wav|would have been mad he wasn't he didn't yell at me at all
data/009503.wav|he's here he's ready to go
data/009502.wav|yes exactly you get stuck inside that zone you're going to be locked down rushes
data/016759.wav|the economy it basically reduces the number of business founded raises the number of
data/019611.wav|is undeniable you hate to see it
data/017092.wav|it belongs to nvidia it's there is nothing interesting about this photo or this tweet at all i'm so shocked that slime did not roast this i'm shocked i
data/012590.wav|in three disney is parks revenues rebounding
data/031721.wav|in episodes of the final season the
data/018856.wav|it was before he got cut
data/012840.wav|even though they'd already booked the sweets and like
data/028885.wav|when i put the cup to my lips the night is now the rest of it's black everything
data/010716.wav|it's still more money there's there's
data/010588.wav|asked the question everyone in chat said yep like they all do it like it's very common and it seems to me and this is just a theory but that one person something weird and then i made fun of
data/028751.wav|it's scary process ever eventually i ran out of money
data/002956.wav|we're watching it but no one's it's just not taking over the
data/005860.wav|i don't want to like doxx anybody or say anything that i
data/019791.wav|this game was a kickstarter game that promised to bring back the magic of mega man to rekindle what mega man fans had lost
data/017906.wav|and there's like a lot of subtle and
data/019749.wav|is rhyme you know it it it's pretty impressive and this is again
data/013240.wav|but i heard it got better as the season went on i
data/005005.wav|the both sides vetting it there's no real way to get around it he
data/000643.wav|they learned they studied my tactics dude it was a real train wreck situation
data/031883.wav|big a a girl asked me to prom and now i have to go but i want to stay
data/021336.wav|i for one one prediction that i think maybe can
data/014428.wav|is it and they use it because you use it okay
data/008417.wav|go and we just yeah it's a
data/017212.wav|sheets and pillows and i hate it it's so disgusting and it
data/000890.wav|goofy and wacky that that sounds like a nickelodeon show this is a serious stream with serious discussions
data/023199.wav|specifically it will not enforce any standards
data/024961.wav|monday but basically i have a map that we're
data/025403.wav|in this coke ad they've been telling me to
data/004202.wav|zoomed out thousand foot look at the situation really
data/025212.wav|do you can't call us anything but a win
data/002999.wav|it's like you can just tell the unease went over the room and then i see a woman in the front she's
data/030921.wav|probably true probably probably the main
data/029731.wav|here's my here's my if i could have magic wand
data/017319.wav|it's like a draft amazon is hiring employees as if they are about to go to war they are gaining more people in their in their employ than armies during a
data/015520.wav|one show the morning show on apple tv
data/004484.wav|a slippery slope so true and wise actually
data/016995.wav|your marketing monday on it so if you don't want to read
data/003230.wav|which is a new version of the game that doesn't involve crypto at all
data/021657.wav|i feel like a much of a breakthrough
data/003049.wav|amc has not answered so i'm shorting amc
data/009532.wav|well even trade okay first kill no
data/022551.wav|because pokemon go was not out yet no you didn't think that it would be years before pokemon go existed this is one of my favorite my favorite april
data/005257.wav|you know there's some girls there's some
data/008357.wav|and wages are in trouble and
data/015978.wav|wharton than making money you just you take a bunch of debt on you lose money you lose
data/026360.wav|the genius bar again the gtsbar
data/018776.wav|i think i've covered the main basics here my my
data/014999.wav|sports is getting hurt as a byproduct
data/025958.wav|they'll bounce back when they get when they get more
data/030572.wav|my one year will be in may my one year of streaming
data/016853.wav|and comfortable uh predicting it but uh
data/032303.wav|it with you all the nice ones can go you can get a million nice ones and that one negative one sticks with
data/032199.wav|player player player winning money making good money
data/016455.wav|there's been an increase in labor
data/027531.wav|as sort of get twitter of the right track and all that i really think he added was an f t profile pictures so overall you can say as sort of get twitter on the right track and all that i really think he added was
data/026967.wav|i think they need more than this i i i
data/022621.wav|cast as angry gamer oh my god so
data/012706.wav|fucking degenerate like i was it doesn't take that much time because you play a game or two of league
data/012891.wav|and i had a dorm room so i he was like an adult dude i was like
data/022809.wav|with the company's goes public for
data/009889.wav|i surreptitiously buying up tons of bunkers and land
data/029041.wav|is this a fight or flight situation so i go like this
data/020517.wav|well and a lot of them don't they have no risk appetite they can't think of cool ideas they don't know what their fans want to hear
data/012995.wav|a little while and you actually learn it
data/029885.wav|in norwalk on july 4th that's how i get
data/000939.wav|despite the fact that you've never participated
data/008184.wav|well as mushroom is over it's dead over

data/017913.wav|what's a one and done but a marvel movie okay they have good
data/005146.wav|a video that will be going up tomorrow
data/001683.wav|and the chocolate factory parents love it children love it heck
data/006845.wav|i like the least cool you don't do any tricks you don't jump you don't you don't grind you just push
data/010422.wav|what i was just being sincere i haven't thanked
data/008653.wav|it as an argument and it doesn't have
data/026130.wav|because it spiked it's the only
data/027363.wav|is it relevant does it matter to gamers i think we've proven that it does
data/007856.wav|right here the one you get when you
data/014778.wav|is from personal and business so that's what i'm going to
data/013967.wav|if the wrong let's say you spend
data/017022.wav|what's going on what's what's the vibes
data/003211.wav|many people in debt basically what turns out what happened is not only were they not making money originally even when
data/029571.wav|stuff you know it's like but back then it really was true and
data/001113.wav|and if there isn't found a club yeah do that i did that for
data/008366.wav|i work at taco bell should i worry probably not probably not i mean you should worry that talk about
data/010544.wav|i'm already on a team you're goping down
data/011026.wav|it's going so far we're in we're tuesday
data/015756.wav|and if you signed up you'd stay but people are
data/028791.wav|so it was like and i was like what what do i say to that so i say it again
data/028334.wav|i have to go and games
data/017044.wav|for that i love some shark tank
data/024727.wav|can i was nothing today was nothing today was a
data/023108.wav|marketing is pure insanity and i resent
data/006329.wav|the only thing i need to make sure that i have is this
data/026478.wav|if the fails of the past week and as usual a lot of my wins and fails mostly fails
data/028040.wav|but they are doing it to scare more stores
data/026306.wav|you have to prioritize and apple's slide
data/016391.wav|about the economics of it more than i do like
data/004552.wav|be a little shy actually maybe we'll just get him to
data/005447.wav|in the reddit if you want to watch uh me
data/029803.wav|started going to tournaments i remember we went to one of the big ones for me
data/019767.wav|what will buy it for a short period of time essentially hype what it is is lying
data/032415.wav|great achievement okay just playing melee is harder than this entire game a million times over it should be something where if you do it you feel
data/029396.wav|i have probably eight dollars eight to twelve dollars in my
data/026596.wav|not me i'm not tooting my own horn here occasionally i'll see someone that makes me just just just
data/010054.wav|well with the flag on the front
data/020841.wav|is the ninja of the youth today's marketing
data/014381.wav|three things there is there's nothing left holding someone on twitch i don't think i
data/022296.wav|as them and their whole family and sues
data/016824.wav|and it's seeing a lot of money and tailwinds
data/011327.wav|if you need a safe place
data/026146.wav|yeah he called a public terrorist threat
data/002097.wav|that most of your decisions are basically coin flips that sounds sick i love that
data/026356.wav|the made a conscious effort to really focus on making it
data/027981.wav|in the fail well i i knew
data/014978.wav|it but they all have different goals they
data/013647.wav|yeah slime told you something that i can't
data/003724.wav|the the on that but on much larger things so they're trying to avoid getting completely broken up long
data/011570.wav|in the day dude i finished streaming 11
data/015292.wav|just to get the rights to james bond
data/002748.wav|a genius mind paid you a mere 150
data/018103.wav|i hate pepsi i will never never have a good memory
data/027468.wav|it's a good question for statement continues
data/028316.wav|in this group melee was too hard for me because i was
data/014591.wav|and live so they can be like gaming on youtube is bigger than ever because every year youtube gaming vods grow so they're
data/031825.wav|i think literally it is amaranth and
data/000198.wav|around with caffeine pills and pops them and says i'm
data/018339.wav|guess how many years of those 17 years
data/009200.wav|i do it's crazy you have friends that play starcraft
data/008154.wav|when i say might i actually
data/008314.wav|i recession why are you why
data/006516.wav|i probably should have and if you ever miss a payment that no fee stuff goes out the window
data/031745.wav|this wouldn't be funny if i didn't
data/021923.wav|not a lot of people in here and
data/013148.wav|in order to make good games you can just go into
data/022519.wav|in better returns i literally would be like okay
data/021079.wav|as are not buying condos let's be real
data/018425.wav|that they made a service where you you pay monthly for stadia you pay a fee
data/022741.wav|what the bigger let's go 12 and a half
data/020899.wav|you can find a lot of articles
data/024796.wav|players should know about it and that incentivizes them to think okay they're doing it i can do it
data/030294.wav|and i just get some random guy
data/025434.wav|and is like clapping and crying because
data/005553.wav|it was at for the shimmer awards doubled up
data/003086.wav|one understandable unfortunately there's not a ton of great economic news that i can throw in the wins and fails so
data/011981.wav|so i started getting these text messages to go around and it's cool because you get to explore the ship and
data/022333.wav|and i added more and created the green out so we did the green out but instead of just doing what
data/010699.wav|the good days like the days where
data/023241.wav|certified and then i looked at the label and a lot of you are spamming same
data/002307.wav|now for 10 years to come back to do one joke
data/014722.wav|what do you mean you don't know me
data/001908.wav|we'll go to jacob wolfe on twitter
data/013432.wav|how do you want me to say it i'll
data/003913.wav|but i don't think sh i don't think she
data/024602.wav|what the slogan driving around i believe south carolina i'm surprised their tires
data/016011.wav|if that you can do it they're not going to
data/027646.wav|interest payment now this company already lost
data/011006.wav|the chimps in two hours i can't do all the rain i can do fall
data/007451.wav|this is a random story but i'll tell it because it's interesting
data/020004.wav|i to go to 30 billion would crash my
data/030440.wav|cause you guys are eventually going
data/000299.wav|with the point is it's fantastic
data/001552.wav|how do you know about death valley
data/026110.wav|and when kellogg's posted online applications for scabs to
data/023395.wav|in nightmare did you go to a good university i went to the best university arizona state university the harvard of the
data/016083.wav|and i found their website which bro you can't
data/029939.wav|never been the ceiling mango's been at the top
data/007518.wav|coffee because i don't drink coffee
data/024545.wav|you have to keep that a complete secret and that is extreme that's not even like that makes no sense with their argument of like we
data/023610.wav|salary on top of bonuses out of her
data/021733.wav|this is going up at the top and actually great this is a great 30 second spot
data/030608.wav|let's go famous composer wolfgang amadeus mozart was born
data/027506.wav|been running for a very long time and it has made almost no money if you go to the max twitter basically has been
data/002746.wav|let's see what you would have
data/032178.wav|the day became saturday and saturday was exactly the casinos still talk about
data/016460.wav|i applied for small business loans from
data/024102.wav|i might be on manhunts next who knows okay he both watched and commented he is a fan okay he loves the content i am now turning my entire channel into
data/028770.wav|i wanted it in so bad and she even told
data/027375.wav|at the stage now you guys know internet businesses especially platforms like like platform businesses like youtube twitch facebook they've all used a
data/006690.wav|it's like trying to sell a posture corrector he doesn't need it
data/023491.wav|selling cars so they can have high perceived value if they get too many
data/004512.wav|and you just uh you just
data/022819.wav|we're going to grow so time warner was despite making about
data/006398.wav|thousands of dollars to buy bolt stock then fired them and the stock crashed
data/018995.wav|what the topic i'm very interested in today i am a marketer
data/014161.wav|is it twitch contracts in this period are
data/026603.wav|the quirky and excitable ruby this show is
data/008661.wav|it's unlikely i think it's unlikely um
data/021580.wav|but if i say okay i'm gonna go to
data/024118.wav|come who are in the market for a car but
data/029107.wav|living out of my car living at
data/003583.wav|is something more reasonable and when that happens being young is an advantage because you could buy in and
data/031248.wav|well i'm dressed in a business suit and i'm like what if i go back to that mall now i don't tell anybody at all which was stupid because i'm just sneaking out i sneak away from the school group
data/026982.wav|i know crypto boo i know crypto bad i
data/028422.wav|or and he didn't do that so he retired um but he was pretty high up
data/014173.wav|so they went for somebody who's connected to every group on twitch to somebody who really is sort of the avatar someone who
data/006742.wav|the percent that cares even smaller that being said during the sun's game
data/025884.wav|worry about sexist culture how do they handle
data/000460.wav|see like we don't want to wait an hour so eventually everyone's like
data/012788.wav|like we have to practice a lot harder and
data/012611.wav|i'm the first whale of many
data/008850.wav|what are you talking about the original
data/021367.wav|a short is essentially a bet that a stock will go down okay so essentially let's say ludwig stock is at
data/013396.wav|broke boy says what okay well you got me on that one
data/028489.wav|so embarrassed and my dad looks at me and he's pissed off my dad's pissed off because why would i do that why would i choose that moment
data/013265.wav|it goes back to one man one devious
data/003503.wav|if i just came into a lot of money from something should i hold
data/000634.wav|we gotta make some and we
data/014013.wav|is selling like one tenth of everything else
data/031451.wav|but stanz did survive poseidon's wrath
data/021628.wav|it's pretty good i like how often the product is
data/029464.wav|while the internship though he's like well what
data/012857.wav|it's too unreliable so i swore right then i was
data/022000.wav|rallying behind it so i'm not so sure
data/002584.wav|for one more chance this is your last
data/014314.wav|if the the good features i like youtube but he can't leave he cannot switch over because twitch prime money was such a big chunk of his income that you can't keep up with it so it's a nuclear bomb it's very powerful and
data/014207.wav|which if you count gaming vod content or
data/028208.wav|we're looking forward in general but after the venue after this whole event they were like it was imperative it was like an urgent there was urgency to it okay blur got on the list
data/004331.wav|right sorry nobody cares keep it to yourself i'm an andrew garfield
data/024347.wav|i that you could have got across by the way an insurance company like in the height of
data/004613.wav|have you reacted to pay the musicians quincy son of quincy of i reacted to it what he have you reacted to pay the musicians quincy son of quincy have i reacted to it
data/027059.wav|it yeah it's just really pretentious but i think this ad being for crypto just
data/016786.wav|so yeah me and ari will try
data/028961.wav|so they were all gone and i realized that i have lost
data/019739.wav|i thought the last weapon we had against
data/014337.wav|what is that they didn't make their own so he's like we need to learn how to do that before
data/012129.wav|like that it was i've never tried anything like it it's kind of like sleep no more which i really want to
data/029963.wav|monday i'm not doing it i wanted to
data/001352.wav|are worried about is if the the priest asks
data/022850.wav|i saw this article i was
data/011885.wav|so that was cool like the bridge was cool but again this is the only time
data/029538.wav|negative memories because i wasn't around in the scene
data/008575.wav|i don't think twitter rules but in this situation they're like
data/021841.wav|it's all about the long term okay
data/024747.wav|consumers from their money and we are starting to see that seep into all aspects of
data/006640.wav|oh my god dude they took chris paul
data/029938.wav|i right from league and even still near the end he wasn't he'd never like he never touched the
data/016768.wav|people are dying almost as fast as
data/019337.wav|so the entire semester was like i
data/000770.wav|again as an idea while drunk i'm just telling you the
data/015218.wav|best positions going forward not because they
data/011647.wav|you can do insane things so what i'm
data/027804.wav|it worked because it was a it was a
data/032000.wav|wondered why until i went to brunch with him and his wife and he was going to order orange juice and his wife said no
data/029714.wav|i say anything but he knew it and he had to let me know and i thought that was such an epic god moment
data/023459.wav|people buying it okay if you want a huge market share you can raise your perceived value really high and keep prices low okay for example think about netflix perfect example netflix could charge more they would get fewer customers
data/014897.wav|you know how the ceo of nintendo's
data/015037.wav|too young to even have this netflix and it wasn't even that long ago this was what netflix was in the early
data/030128.wav|the the game for months and my dad is
data/027216.wav|want to talk about today the main questions about difficulty because i think that's the most interesting aspect of
data/022912.wav|how they love the idea of
data/029659.wav|and i kind of i was like yeah that that makes sense bro
data/026400.wav|the thinking about this type of this this
data/023495.wav|fucking month because they sell trucks every month
data/004911.wav|or payday for each share we owned it's an
data/021930.wav|is off and this content almost ran by itself with the power of the the team that i built with with
data/001267.wav|part one look at the iconic
data/025068.wav|when ethiopian government was dead broke and there was a famine
data/000777.wav|but anyway that was our idea to make
data/026688.wav|these meetings i didn't know this is this
data/027844.wav|targets of the everything bubble popping it's going to be though it seems to be
data/004644.wav|no i i really am not interested but thank you for your time and i hang up
data/012045.wav|close our eyes and do it again but this
data/005256.wav|knows me which again is fine which again is fine but they don't know me okay they don't know me it's like it's
data/008898.wav|the day twitter is other rich dudes you
data/001518.wav|and all i want to ask you is are you
data/014994.wav|well seeing dramatic collapses and this is leading to
data/017108.wav|i know what major you're going
data/018925.wav|we give us nearly two billion dollars we will guarantee you a big success with the
data/020694.wav|real awards and the monday goes to
data/030187.wav|or like all right on your mark get set go and we had money on it we had
data/002116.wav|would be impossible wait i think 2024 we
data/003727.wav|and they're positioning it as sales fall
data/005649.wav|so i go to dinner with a bunch of people i've never really hung out with
data/014089.wav|kicking off every single person who
data/006941.wav|i had a very very very very
data/027817.wav|we should i buy the dip a lot of people who have been investing in the past let's say 10 years have never seen a market
data/027162.wav|wait the currency enough your debt is worthless the
data/013897.wav|i'm even more mad at the movie there's
data/000945.wav|it was a surprise to me thank god that it got leaked because i had a bunch of not a bunch but
data/025504.wav|what do they do so anyway i feel like this is the truth for a lot of companies or
data/021607.wav|i say about that but it was the story this is like the only interesting story of the game itself that's why
data/003058.wav|we would i was just you know what
data/020080.wav|it's a ton of money twitch still loses money and is being sued by a million record labels the greatest acquisition of all time what is number one is it minecraft poggies is it
data/031528.wav|but like artosa says that many
data/013798.wav|when scientists have come up with so you better pray for these little guys
data/011442.wav|in a barber you want that
data/017671.wav|are packaging to what it would look like if microsoft
data/005010.wav|what of lawyers on his side
data/026759.wav|it's will look like to try and take down
data/026584.wav|way better oh my god this is the problem with people
data/013043.wav|it was like how because we pay teachers so little and give them no respect there's so many bad teachers and to accommodate of having so many bad teachers we have to be so strict
data/018712.wav|if we lose this console war we've got no
data/029925.wav|it has never won a tournament and then so when he finally beat
data/027413.wav|would not be competed with by the government they wouldn't make their own free software as long as they would agree to offer a free version to the majority of americans okay but the thing they did is do everything possible to hide that
data/031512.wav|is the last game of the last season
data/021242.wav|because as you can see from this graph is now massively massively bigger than films or music green is films
data/009279.wav|maybe we'll do that actually sounds fun the boss is pretty fun
data/018568.wav|it's nobody's just flopping out of the gate
data/030088.wav|you don't understand how long i've been hauling
data/027558.wav|printing a bunch of new shares it dilutes the amounts of shares there are so that they
data/005438.wav|with a marketing manager for me to say no so i took
data/024953.wav|loser and here i am four months later into the game greetings fellow masters i
data/015391.wav|every warner brothers movie day and date same as theatrical release online okay so when dune comes out in theaters you can instead watch it as it's meant
data/024771.wav|what that skin having to go to your wallet and
data/008097.wav|very much man oh my gosh 50. that's crazy
data/003582.wav|is he could not buy in to stocks or housing at the incredible prices it was at it was too high so eventually you got to clear the brush out of the forest like zombie companies have to go under
data/013115.wav|in one week okay i'm hustling i'm grinding
data/007745.wav|why those didn't sell better they pay for themselves they literally pay for themselves you wear a sigma
data/024589.wav|that was going on throughout the entire app over his epic trial and that was the trial to determine whether or not this character could appear naked and i guess what peely can
data/030855.wav|and then nearly got an alternate account and donated to play it during
data/012210.wav|and i won't have it all right
data/030034.wav|oh boy it's you know there's nothing like a good awe boys
data/003615.wav|if you are able of having a good
data/002831.wav|it is it's not good for the company and
data/011491.wav|the bit of a different thing where we don't
data/023497.wav|their market share gets too big they lose the exclusive value of
data/021853.wav|at of the actual serious part
data/022533.wav|smart googlers are how much different the google
data/032336.wav|it was descending dark the ability that grants
data/000338.wav|it wouldn't do anything like the
data/030376.wav|this is like this never happens but what if they check my bag and they pull out the
data/020281.wav|for is deserved instead of paying
data/014198.wav|facebook has been known to lie okay and in general from what i've seen youtube has been growing at a steady pace as well as
data/006907.wav|i just never left the office
data/012655.wav|if the gator what's that for
data/019603.wav|they sound like me talking to my
data/009767.wav|doesn't do it at all anyway today we're gonna be watching
data/006820.wav|but i'll probably do an episode of night
data/025548.wav|if they should just be more organized so they have more effective ways to leverage their power because they have power
data/001373.wav|in the discord call real quick if you just are
data/011990.wav|and you start to like meet people and realize who
data/023049.wav|it's probably going to happen here is epic
data/011744.wav|you know i bet if i were to drop
data/008499.wav|at the end of the day it's a legal document but it is interesting
data/023032.wav|legally i can't even say what they take they take a lot more
data/027181.wav|in the way you think today's marketing monday topic is a debate
data/023129.wav|what if we can get people to eat them and so they
data/015828.wav|that's already a dying industry and it's going to be replaced with online variants people who are gen z are
data/023245.wav|it was more unhealthy than jolly rancher
data/008662.wav|he could just not pay you know
data/000886.wav|we'll figure out where we meet we'll
data/002361.wav|what i'll get you the steak and
data/027709.wav|which is awesome overall cool app
data/024253.wav|what the next one kia's the
data/010688.wav|it's just simple politeness i was asking how you're doing i doesn't you don't
data/007435.wav|dude if i had any uh you know you
data/011158.wav|no actually i think the tv
data/006617.wav|here's a tip step one quincy step two engineer
data/022257.wav|okay well yeah i wasn't i wasn't expecting man literally i was like cracking a joke for the first
data/007214.wav|care how much this costs this
data/011283.wav|because i promise you your desktop audio is always way louder than you
data/002348.wav|that's just hours you could have gotten there's really no getting around it
data/012951.wav|and your opinion uh you said any worth i'm
data/010479.wav|you could try bursting into tears i could do that but
data/003553.wav|the time i was most doomer in my life
data/030118.wav|i am in pure denial my dad is angry he skipped right to angry because
data/000778.wav|the that we ended up not doing it
data/010751.wav|i love an exam just finish the exam
data/011699.wav|i can get the videos here
data/028602.wav|a got bought it got bought it got
data/012446.wav|i wanna help you like he's talking about and
data/013427.wav|i want to lecture me on the different ways to pronounce five nights at freddy's fandom that's a you problem that is
data/026507.wav|story to tell you can hate or you can create what'll it be and the internet chose hate
data/012068.wav|the experience for both me and
data/004700.wav|is he has recommended smoking a fat blunt as a

data/018646.wav|no i don't monopolies no longer get
data/019145.wav|i think that this is not the most inspired brand partnership you know I'm not but
data/008780.wav|is that it's not all of his money so like
data/029514.wav|it was their whole life mission
data/013855.wav|if you actually didn't care you wouldn't tweet about it and i know
data/022953.wav|if they don't talk like this anymore
data/005992.wav|and it's it's just absolutely the worst because they've

data/007706.wav|the find like a girl who speaks spanish and then try to
data/029860.wav|and scarves in the pieces this is you could ask any fossil
data/011182.wav|if you're like regularly going on hikes
data/030064.wav|at six years old probably the world's biggest pokemon fan i love pokemon i

data/002725.wav|maybe two if you keep pushing it okay
data/002628.wav|misinterpreted the signals let's find out if you truly have the foresight the wisdom this needs to be tails again
data/005316.wav|if the women we were talking a lot it was a
data/018901.wav|they can't so we have a genius plan here's what we'll do we'll take

data/030035.wav|nothing makes you feel like a
data/016627.wav|the hottest years ever in history 19 of
data/023154.wav|i can relate or whatever so i thought i'd give a talk about some of the tricks of the trade that turned like a burger that looks
data/025712.wav|is everyone dressing up as a clown which is ronald mcdonald's thing
data/011510.wav|as twitter deal you should just think that
data/022126.wav|put it lightly pretty irresponsible this guy's
data/031051.wav|where he got his money he bought
data/024839.wav|it's business model that when they release a
data/016257.wav|all the way into the season opener against the
data/003675.wav|i kind of snowballs and that's the real problem that i have is like er is just
data/004319.wav|well would be my guest why why would you think that
data/027416.wav|include it in a search engine so the
data/023025.wav|big money if epic wins this lawsuit apple says then all these other people will lose money
data/003634.wav|so boomers control all the wealth basically in
data/000632.wav|really nice it was really really nice so
data/011407.wav|if you don't follow melee i don't blame you you
data/017487.wav|well reagan basically there has been um
data/015207.wav|when you could win the entire globe they
data/013780.wav|hey what do you do when your name your brand name is
data/030923.wav|oh true story so when i was interviewing
data/001086.wav|it won't be invited nor asked to but i'm sure he will
data/026493.wav|after two months of outreach conversation with former business partners and
data/030221.wav|knock knock knock knock no no no no no no no no no no no no no
data/024153.wav|it's funny that like ninja hit the
data/026261.wav|if the the government but in general uh the reasons
data/019721.wav|the student loan debt has gone
data/011289.wav|the time and it's okay yeah
data/007766.wav|wow look at me no pants andy connor ate them
data/022496.wav|i'm going to start with the company
data/027630.wav|this is actually the take that i think almost no one's talking about that i think is my final big concern so the amount of money was
data/004289.wav|one little speaker crackling and then you can't understand me and then you're like oh i wish
data/003426.wav|or is like a you know it leads to an active
data/005282.wav|the whole thing is so awkward thank god thank god because the line was really
data/030243.wav|going to be kind of sad kind of lonely everyone's going home to see their family what am i
data/022854.wav|tom was going to the moon he said
data/006463.wav|it was like dystopia rebranded let's get to an actual fail let's get to actual fail and
data/030751.wav|the sweetest mother they got it right maya they got it right
data/009537.wav|in this game over two kills
data/022863.wav|so i just want to close this targeting tuesday by saying i think
data/026408.wav|and the clock model is a way to think about any brand and in fact you can um you
data/006227.wav|if you win flip it over
data/011533.wav|it's cool yeah i did see there was a mr mrs
data/001609.wav|we're going to watch videos that have three criteria number one don't be boring number two don't be too long and number three and most importantly at the end of the video we should have learned a thing or two we should come away with it thinking
data/008708.wav|see a bot that seems likely one
data/020988.wav|crack up i could totally relate to the guy thinking it was
data/011882.wav|look pretty cool and it really it's like
data/025508.wav|to a charity in the cayman islands connected back to our bank account so
data/009633.wav|but this is a classic gg go next in solo
data/016042.wav|i my setup so i'll probably still stream from arizona i'm thinking of doing a family stream real ones remember real ones know i did a family stream back in the day where may asked in my setup so i'll probably still stream from arizona i'm thinking of doing a family stream

data/004470.wav|if i feel like it and then

data/023951.wav|go anywhere else canada has realized they're so bad at marketing
data/020349.wav|i don't don't be so specific on that you're not in the market for
data/025812.wav|of these companies was sued by the state of california for a culture of sexual harassment one of these companies was also deeply tied to china
data/008030.wav|what i'm saying and the problem is it's so
data/000600.wav|crashing around people are flying off it's crazy that happens it wakes me
data/025948.wav|is the overwatch league 60 million dollars for
data/007758.wav|if the think embarrassing to say
data/004254.wav|it is unfortunate i mean there's so much
data/029660.wav|i walked away from there like
data/023200.wav|so companies will just slap it on anything that's not selling and
data/013685.wav|you could possibly imagine if you guys don't
data/014383.wav|or worse the live experience is buggier
data/027452.wav|release date back give that some
data/028343.wav|i went down to last stock

data/025291.wav|the my first win that's my first win and
data/003258.wav|on store shelves and has sales figures is
data/009453.wav|what we're getting out of him but uh uh
data/014201.wav|it's a better way to think it's
data/010949.wav|and we might have to increase it hey truck can you please speak towards
data/018268.wav|pet suicide oh oh my girlfriend had one
data/015662.wav|netflix and amazon prime have been killing it and the way they're doing business their strategy seems the smartest
data/008181.wav|we just think the minions day
data/025944.wav|it's innovative in the same year this is overwatch league
data/012444.wav|in order i think you got general written all over you the way you've been
data/021363.wav|in the last week and yes i did and what i gained was
data/008545.wav|if the thing for it he loses between
data/014580.wav|they pay big bucks because they're they have
data/016649.wav|the price of batteries has fallen exponentially similar to
data/010058.wav|that was historical yes that was
data/017355.wav|what was interesting is so there was an interview with some amazon recruiters and executives about this massive hiring pace and
data/021789.wav|of making you want to do some nature stuff
data/000463.wav|but nick allen showed up as another surprise
data/018854.wav|of the school any publicity is good
data/012400.wav|a fire alarm like don't be scared that you're
data/004628.wav|many different crypto based moon shots
data/028568.wav|yeah whatever like that so anyway it was being
data/002474.wav|we did a bunch of chips quickly they bought them and so
data/005724.wav|that he bought for will quote for will neff he said for
data/027671.wav|it must can make twitter very profitable very
data/020763.wav|and of the year for marketing because he partnered with literally every goddamn brand on the planet travis scott travis scott started this year
data/029262.wav|at can you believe it's all deserved because he got rid of big dig
data/031946.wav|well parents are freaking out how
data/032166.wav|give up the pit boss's biggest fear
data/005730.wav|and then i'll say this all right
data/025585.wav|it's not moving at all and not blinking that
data/002456.wav|and marketers don't often have enough actionable data on what the actual demographics of their customers
data/006759.wav|massive youtuber extremely funny and he most of his content is
data/027151.wav|around it there's going to be
data/025179.wav|while your chips taste so i added a tagline too for you the
data/005034.wav|it's and every post so every person
data/017191.wav|my god dude i was i was really really upset
data/002074.wav|like that you know some something
data/007774.wav|if my subscription was a pregnancy by now we could have had triplets no we've already talked about this right
data/016278.wav|a big warm shout out to our favorite promisers in the gaming
data/027818.wav|where stocks don't always go up people are kind of under the impression that stocks always go up that's not true at all
data/032202.wav|it's a money printer all right so all of
data/031427.wav|you know not as one does when you're playing competitive
data/006719.wav|oh there it is the veil here it is
data/008270.wav|and of the day that's where
data/002879.wav|i was going to pay for this this difference so what's interesting though and what's very very interesting
data/026642.wav|muscle they get from opening one industry to buy out or dominate others and it creates a very interesting competitive landscape okay muscle they get from owning one industry to uh buy out or dominate others and it
data/013737.wav|he uploaded a sex game to roblox use slurs yeah yeah so
data/028925.wav|well now she told the story laughing no not assault guys
data/020091.wav|come over to apple john scully and then that guy and steve
data/030769.wav|why did you think i needed that right then that's so funny
data/014005.wav|we still have a few more hoodies hoodies
data/003519.wav|i don't see anything as um existential
data/011157.wav|i am morbius poster that i have behind my tv right now and also my sigma mail poster no
data/014268.wav|when i can't stick my i can't land on my eyes will not land on it it's like
data/021056.wav|for free wow i just may
data/009373.wav|well i know how these tournaments actually should go
data/005635.wav|with miz was exactly like that so that's
data/004273.wav|the only downside of crypto is that you lose all your money because the number goes down it can't because you're not allowed to sell
data/000808.wav|i just keep tossing it in i'd lose all right
data/014210.wav|but in terms of live which is growing rapidly and nobody wants to get disrupted by you think about facebook getting disrupted by
data/005095.wav|i actually i'm not sure that i have but
data/018477.wav|they brought their kill streak they pulled it out so we're going to talk about that today we're
data/022398.wav|what did she say i understood none of
data/006930.wav|well as i just don't shower and of those three options the last two i usually wear a hat
data/017286.wav|at stories begin here is edward
data/029901.wav|where to get back home and
data/001671.wav|for heist that formula one racing has pulled in the last three years they literally planned and executed an ultimate content
data/012868.wav|and a good senior year so that's what i brought my
data/018885.wav|well let's let's close the street
data/018991.wav|the idiocy of the two founders just just wasted
data/022130.wav|at the end of the day you only exist to sell more of a product and we understand that and the more clearly you understand that i think the better your social can be people are not opposed to brands on principle if you are aware and honest that you're trying to sell something people are generally either ignore it or they're receptive
data/027345.wav|this is not an isolated incident this is almost the core of what has given these things
data/002239.wav|windsor marketing and things like that yeah but not like well you don't like do
data/005319.wav|we're definitely gonna do it and the dream blunt rotation
data/002656.wav|girl is that what i'm seeing
data/003705.wav|know that basically like if you sell a lamp or batteries or um a
data/027963.wav|are you see me has is kind of the perfect energy
data/003204.wav|at the poverty i read an interesting story i'm
data/003825.wav|it's a lotta people to subvert traditional means to the channels of power
data/024834.wav|there's constantly adding more to make sure that it's not the case another thing
data/010258.wav|psychic no longer an innocent child sounds like he's
data/022855.wav|the moon they looked at all of his history
data/018675.wav|the quote from the prime minister of great britain but it was pretty close europe was pretty close and japan was a thousand
data/024881.wav|they would have said before that okay so people once they
data/015445.wav|they have the best world-class ip the red
data/008561.wav|is right to discovery he says i don't want
data/007691.wav|our streams and then only occasionally like today i'll stream for a few hours late at night but
data/017326.wav|what of political power is the main thing that's
data/007605.wav|start lying okay if i start meeting my editors in person
data/008729.wav|it has to be i think it's
data/006553.wav|and appliances things that they want to buy for
data/018865.wav|it's the thirstiest time of the year with claymation celebrities and
data/006897.wav|and a culture it was a short for your first meeting chemicals are so i don't think i really i lived at work and a culture it was a show up for your first meeting kind of culture so i i don't
data/024160.wav|dream league of legends only and not give a
data/024095.wav|we are so right you're not gonna get
data/006539.wav|if the profit center and a lot of what apple's
data/023621.wav|of bars because it passes three tests okay the ingredients are natural they smell good and
data/018791.wav|at us jump in to the first ad and then I
data/009352.wav|i know that comment um the
data/002238.wav|tv advertising so like social ads and influencer
data/000582.wav|it was a hitman dude a spanked decor after
data/020740.wav|but to be truly terrible to stand out you can't just be a
data/024395.wav|these ads are pretty big waste of money i think if you feel like
data/010091.wav|that can come with your box if you get factor
data/024904.wav|if you like you did some work they will give you a randomized reward based on some amount of effort like let's say you plant a crop and then it grows and then you get something special any kind of
data/002182.wav|i was hustling i was working like
data/012815.wav|team of the country we won ivy law
data/019865.wav|and it was supposed to be a godlike
data/020744.wav|herman the worst out of the year and when i think back to make
data/014462.wav|it's not a huge deal it would be
data/006116.wav|that's what you have to understand
data/031987.wav|the weekend and then the weekday they go back and kiss susie during the school shooter
data/021432.wav|when they came knocking that's like their boss i mean that's how
data/028085.wav|i ever done because you can tell that he
data/015877.wav|you to take marketing money to the big screen well it's not really the big screen is
data/007339.wav|bet you hi congratulations on i think we went even
data/026559.wav|was you can make so much money instantly or add a thing where you could pay a dollar to get a new puzzle on the same day i mean this guy could print money and he's choosing not to do it which is like an insane
data/016757.wav|is just open up to immigration you know this is a pure
data/031785.wav|that holds the new twitch together the arrival of the hot tub meta it turns out should be called the arrival of the amaranth meta because looking back at this last month
data/030907.wav|i mean we'll get you something i'm
data/023080.wav|equivalent every three years at retail price okay so you must be really hardcore
data/014900.wav|and the nintendo's lawsuits have felt at least thematically appropriate
data/014908.wav|the fact that he agreed to pay it is interesting so he agreed to
data/009241.wav|we're going to tune in a second i'm going to watch this
data/000950.wav|and then i find out my bachelor party is this weekend and i have to like
data/022242.wav|why did he have to sound so insanely sad and
data/025833.wav|the ip live beyond video games and so what
data/016253.wav|i was like you know what i'm gonna go ahead and do that research i'm
data/019922.wav|it's just it's not always it's super duper generic but it's also at this point by the time it releases incredibly outdated like shooters have been
data/014011.wav|and you could really kick off dog shampoo for example that's an interesting one
data/027193.wav|calling prototype and no one else wanted to work on it he wanted to work on it because he figured if i could find a way to take
data/031044.wav|was like in the cracks of every window and like there was just deep black mold
data/028753.wav|at the call from hey guys if you guys use hey guys
data/006946.wav|the world is my oyster but when you turn
data/015669.wav|movies people want to watch and so as long as you have amazing content and also they've proven they can do it with like loki and
data/025018.wav|who said god damn it i just heard a rumor i'm not

data/015882.wav|one bundle would be killer but you can only get that at
data/030379.wav|with the different line and you put the ring on your dick right is that what you think i did you think i took the ring out of the bag mid
data/030636.wav|cape books called like rivers of the world that was the only
data/004972.wav|his political stances all seem to be based on things coming from his own personal life that he
data/023955.wav|i would assume the cola sells worse
data/006589.wav|that says we were all busy that weekend
data/009725.wav|seeing someone if you saw someone get
data/000877.wav|what do you want in this world
data/010237.wav|and always raise money for charity too

data/016151.wav|what months shine your light on me think of the nine months
data/015876.wav|the ad hoc model where they just basically subscribe to one service their main service probably netflix and
data/023141.wav|cause it's not taste how things are presented is the difference between
data/014189.wav|i was about where we are now let's talk about where we are now in those streaming
data/017806.wav|intelligent for for the modern times okay
data/008019.wav|very impressed i'm very very impressed
data/021324.wav|listen streamers make a lot of money from subs but the amount of money you would make from having a popular game massively dwarfs that i'm getting i'm getting closer to the
data/025632.wav|up on revenue they're making more money than ever but they're spending more money than ever the war is expensive and so in
data/003575.wav|kind of attitude you know what i'm saying that's all
data/014682.wav|with sonic hedgehog both spelled wrong sonic spelled wrong hedgehog spelled wrong and your first
data/015509.wav|in dollars the most valuable company on
data/011722.wav|yup just yet okay i'm gonna
data/002787.wav|good looking out you know stay classy
data/029591.wav|one kind of what he needed to focus on and i was making this point i kind of realized this watching the
data/028279.wav|with my life that's a judge of character that guy's a
data/013000.wav|reinforcement like you had to like sit down and try it until you learned it
data/003014.wav|if you're looking at like we're
data/008975.wav|two people so since the deal has been signed to now twitter fired two big executives
data/008916.wav|wanna talk if you have something you have to like if i owe you money for something or whatever go through pay he's going to handle that and i'm um i'm
data/010470.wav|big a youtube frog here first time

data/019241.wav|you get denied by the ladies shoot
data/030896.wav|and then i poop and my acid reflux
data/000210.wav|hang out we go to the steakhouse and the
data/012525.wav|in the dark okay i i don't need my the things that make
data/005170.wav|deep dirt under everyone she had

data/031958.wav|where he worked for ludwig this a slime back when he worked for bts he produces event and at this point slimy where he worked for ludwig this is slime back when he worked for bts
data/026269.wav|that conclusion if you look at the data it
data/027231.wav|when a game actually refuses to do that and cuts it all back it's also freeing the branding choices that it's made
data/024576.wav|it's because at the end of this all even though
data/013147.wav|the more powerful overall media because people love games and if you can
data/027672.wav|very quickly charge people one dollar per month for every
data/011539.wav|by the day the weaves have infiltrated all aspects of our life and government weebs are everywhere
data/006934.wav|and it was also farther from my house
data/027048.wav|it'd be excited for this show
data/022114.wav|this to me one of the worst brand tweets of all time this was this did take place at the end
data/029266.wav|dubbed lord helix president was the
data/012081.wav|couple girls eventually join up but it was mostly boys ends up being probably like i
data/032173.wav|i let it ride i double up again on the field i say let it ride though and i don't give him his chip back
data/015179.wav|what netflix to be included at
data/003335.wav|economy into a recession to prevent any sort of wage price spiral from happening which would mean rising wages
data/022210.wav|old man gets shredded lift up his
data/011121.wav|can use headphones anymore so i'm going through speakers
data/026331.wav|a verizon store costs less than half a million dollars to open but it shows right the difference between this and this it shows you can you can
data/024734.wav|video games but first i want to start by having you watch a very short video that maybe illustrates the point i'm trying to make here about
data/009379.wav|nobody's doing and he's doing and he's dead in
data/003776.wav|and i left a long voicemail
data/027835.wav|what used to be the main metric for businesses until this whole bubble and uh these guys are burning
data/008262.wav|it's the connect and build communities
data/009650.wav|what does that boy boy has picked up a rallies
data/028755.wav|at my parents home in colorado colorado
data/007564.wav|the theme for this but because australians cannot just take a roast
data/004593.wav|won't mention them but i'll keep eating it and
data/010150.wav|and i made the mistake of promising that i'd get pepper sprayed so okay
data/031254.wav|but i really i really want to watch this game there was uh there was two parts of the mall
data/024422.wav|and i saw this ad from korea
data/008410.wav|i used to have the best titles in the business and then coney came along
data/001260.wav|but i haven't seen it yet
data/005830.wav|the make sure he was cool i was trying to balance like
data/022843.wav|the next year not only do they lose all that money they have to do a write down of
data/007224.wav|know he's a little he's just he's
data/015738.wav|and it was entirely through the free trial then i cancelled um the boys
data/012261.wav|the game but he asked me to take over from the
data/000884.wav|i could say anything you say
data/007602.wav|it would be really cringe in person so i
data/011180.wav|there's truth in this if your life gets
data/002135.wav|with the full article that i can't read because it
data/023068.wav|it's on food annually it's seven
data/031100.wav|let's go up your money goes up it is not like this it is more like this let's use a red one like straight
data/028132.wav|we all imploding almost every spec that
data/023548.wav|you killed taxis a lot of cities don't even have
data/026925.wav|all they're really trying to get across is
data/019216.wav|no and my jaw hit the floor as a kid I mean
data/008631.wav|and that's losing money if i give you a
data/011311.wav|if the first semester was coven
data/011956.wav|you know i i like i was like oh this
data/020996.wav|and that's exactly where i think it
data/014415.wav|gotta crack if they crack these problems twitch stays on top if they don't i
data/028767.wav|to be like no i can't afford housing
data/006854.wav|i don't have a private gym like blood okay
data/004257.wav|make it even more hyped up and more insane they always they add lies to it and then it
data/016893.wav|serve their content it just they got massive
data/012440.wav|we like if you're a bad guy you
data/000713.wav|something like bro i've always loved you
data/020786.wav|i think is the best ad of the year the
data/027355.wav|and you try to find out the core where's
data/026259.wav|your money would have gone up like five thousand seven hundred and eighty percent and there are many reasons for this
data/002251.wav|is advertising he liked it but didn't understand the jokes the trend of people sending marketing
data/005443.wav|in bright white smile and this dude's like
data/013006.wav|i e be done you'd be done and that's just
data/027849.wav|yeah there's also entertainment from watching
data/027755.wav|well there's no there's absolutely no way this
data/004328.wav|add that i'll never said that tom holland
data/014044.wav|the avatar okay he he is connected to every group
data/009418.wav|if you're if you want to say hey just stay in the back don't die put

data/013820.wav|was on online is depressing me cause it's all like
data/012522.wav|wants to do you'll never be bored for the full
data/006515.wav|what it in different payments and when the payments actually come
data/028707.wav|he's like hey because i i was trying to
data/023308.wav|he might have handled this you know what i'm saying this is a very smart seasoned pr strategy to just get it away to just
data/001880.wav|while visionaries he invited me on
data/004581.wav|eating a factor meal right now goat
data/004717.wav|toss almost every song you can in there
data/025854.wav|paid me to go to an event they also paid for
data/021771.wav|okay well that's the first time
data/011567.wav|and that's cool that's fine that's
data/031839.wav|in pack openings this past year a billion what is pink
data/020881.wav|decisions are critical and plentiful risk is for real stress can be crippling delegation could be impossible if you're
data/000928.wav|in one thousand dollars okay i like your moxie aim reasonable twenty thousand dollars
data/004908.wav|with this extremely high offer for
data/025440.wav|who is now sentient who nods back so pepsi may have
data/026761.wav|actually actually we could even say goodbye to some of the ceos that have tuned
data/003606.wav|why and i have basically two jobs that are doing really well
data/018107.wav|i swear to god god gamer
data/019228.wav|as a marketer the Wii was genius okay
data/018092.wav|the landing in the desert this these problems are too serious for pepsi man to handle this is soldiers in a crashed helicopter whoa whoa
data/015685.wav|emerge last a few more years and then die that is my
data/029825.wav|we have to watch this youtube video
data/031555.wav|is the best player in the world
data/004873.wav|if the world and he is demanding in all hands emails that every single person comes into the office for
data/018648.wav|monopolies what if microsoft bought discord that's not crazy
data/018483.wav|the most valuable companies in the world in a current ranking apple currently the most
data/012016.wav|they friday like they kind of already knew that i was evil and that
data/016502.wav|one became like the third biggest company in the world
data/009763.wav|i rented it from a blockbuster
data/027423.wav|but thankfully thankfully you know what
data/028100.wav|million dollars in value in a day
data/022997.wav|you have to do no work apple does barely any work and they get an insane amount of money
data/009977.wav|more than a rapper i'm an actor too so here's
data/031096.wav|because i know the math i've worked at
data/012507.wav|for margins i think they let a lot of fat extra to make money also i've lost way more than five k in vegas for margins i think they left a lot of fat extra to make money
data/026113.wav|which i found to be quite impressive and it led to
data/007430.wav|if you want to cover that up with an
data/011872.wav|it it actually feeds back into what's going on the ship so what i realized is that pretty quickly i realized this is that
data/007993.wav|you guys are like reverse my parents my parents were always like hey listen love this stream but
data/030694.wav|and she's like did you hear did you hear
data/013629.wav|wait a minute what the this
data/003501.wav|in america but the bill was only 50 billion dollars
data/007864.wav|we see what a terrible merch idea
data/031778.wav|i really got me great post
data/030357.wav|she's always talked about going to tahiti
data/030870.wav|where i the uncle iro but young
data/013356.wav|i'm trying to help you you think
data/027307.wav|they wouldn't be strong enough to stop themselves from creating the difficulty
data/024543.wav|there's no cut okay so apple literally
data/030643.wav|know what what two nations border the united states of america and
data/019585.wav|actually catchy well i was shopping for a new car which
data/017568.wav|over the past 10 years apple
data/024990.wav|and made some ads and everyone voted the wrong way and uber got off
data/032027.wav|as wanting more like the one year bobby was
data/004043.wav|i was basically trying to like take my mind off not feeling so well i wasn't i don't think i was sick straight up
data/026020.wav|the pooh becomes public domain so i think you can see where this is going winnie the screwed chapter one
data/002867.wav|the past and the fact that the the judges said you know
data/013632.wav|actual streaming wars twitch v youtube
data/019118.wav|stock and we can see who's really
data/011915.wav|you can see this this is like
data/003840.wav|there's people that have found a way to
data/025896.wav|he believes or trusts a youtuber apology
data/028826.wav|well apartment where you could basically live in this office and that's what i did i never left the office
data/028023.wav|i regularly i give wins and fails updates
data/001523.wav|i'm thinking about it every time here simple question that i'm sure you
data/015537.wav|impact or ruthlessness that amazon has and from looking at it closely it just feels like that's the idea in theory but not in practice because right now they're the smallest by far so this is a
data/032003.wav|im sorry and scar was very whipped at that dinner
data/022466.wav|well it's beautiful it's clean and it's a great
data/013829.wav|this guy lol sorry for what xbox is barely clean at twenty
data/022053.wav|which is about domestic abuse saying you had pizza
data/004544.wav|i know it's a little embarrassing but it'll actually be great it'll be great for your political career people will love it this will be a big idea for
data/015713.wav|take a chance on marketing monday and i'm glad that lily has taken the leap and they went all out with this full
data/010540.wav|we'll figure it out we'll figure it out
data/019799.wav|with the great movies uh optioned
data/002968.wav|i'm gonna tell you guys what
data/009550.wav|it's better on paper it has the two best
data/004277.wav|welcome to marketing monday on a wednesday let's kick things off with the wins and fails starting out before we even get to a win or
data/005425.wav|drama frog they're both good at youtube it's possible for multiple people to be good at youtube otherwise we're all just
data/031855.wav|is still the face of twitch it hasn't changed ludwig did have a month did a
data/008483.wav|i must send you to brazil i want
data/024522.wav|i it looks like apple does have monopoly
data/030530.wav|whilst we go on this vacation that was the plan and
data/007653.wav|and then like hulu and amazon prime sharpening their knives like like like walking towards the throne
data/021513.wav|and then take a little cut and instead of investing
data/007559.wav|so he's like take my phone i'll find it
data/005226.wav|and they did lose a little bit but i want to
data/008226.wav|that he literally raises interest rates stops inflation by
data/029265.wav|and turn the helix fossil into a nominates dubbed lord and turn the helix fossil into an ammonite
data/031150.wav|the only thing i have a problem with was the the saying only three thousand
data/022530.wav|a google paid for most of this movie
data/002147.wav|the official launch of the new party is my birthday did you invite yang is it a conflict
data/019088.wav|they try to be super authentic super relatable this is a human that feels like it's it's trying to exploit vulnerable people that's what it feels like to me now that being said none of this applies to
data/007179.wav|i heard that he has trouble getting out of state he has a hard time getting to tournaments he's like
data/029474.wav|you should check this guy out give it give him a ring
data/022874.wav|the arguments done over zoom children found the
data/022641.wav|the team this has been a
data/016060.wav|in a truck oh god hi
data/003176.wav|for like the past five or six years
data/028077.wav|or phone or an ipod if this keeps going
data/002542.wav|you lost what are you talking about me don't they don't don't throw
data/025353.wav|by the way this is our office they had
data/019101.wav|if he was just himself i don't think it would be as relatable or interesting to the audience he's going for it's like
data/027378.wav|they look the other way it helps them
data/030836.wav|somebody my co-workers know too much
data/011863.wav|in the story of the trip things are happening on the window so it's cool i
data/016841.wav|with the scariest ones the one that
data/030210.wav|or try of it because he won the first one
data/020621.wav|and that of course is the worst attempt
data/006608.wav|i ended the day it's like 12 coffee count memes
data/019818.wav|this game might be number this game might be number one but let me give you my reasoning let me give you my
data/023697.wav|the cliff and quit my job and and
data/032038.wav|on my script i just wrote dunk a
data/028153.wav|get that it means they cannot pay their bills which means
data/030697.wav|that's like crushing and i remember i said dude kyle got second place and he's in sixth
data/023848.wav|in delroy and his um his new album back to the
data/028943.wav|truly cannot sniff jack daniels without feeling sick other than that
data/004632.wav|it's still up over the past five years but it's down right now but back when it was up i would get these cold calls all the time from wealth managers they just called every single nvidia employee and they're like hey
data/018348.wav|it should get some form of stock if you're working in a
data/028983.wav|gummy bears i didn't feel hungry i just felt sick so
data/008665.wav|to pay it just feels it feels hard to do if he truly just
data/005298.wav|what should i couldn't i was like
data/031491.wav|if there's there's no the levels
data/011955.wav|it's myself and i'm like listen if you need help on this ship
data/009491.wav|knowing that their value will just go up
data/004338.wav|is as funny as he might think
data/030790.wav|what did you mean when you said she blown my dick like a cello
data/022121.wav|by responding to moon pie what's going on
data/031481.wav|i still firmly believe that the world would be a better place where that wealth
data/011666.wav|the five hour flight to florida to the to the orlando disney world where they have built a gigantic
data/018038.wav|weird strange mask running through my living room this is
data/030077.wav|if the kid that delays a marshmallow to get two
data/004028.wav|we'll get to it though that's that's
data/018672.wav|every time you bought a console they lost money that is how attractive the pricing was okay but they managed to gain market share and some
data/011797.wav|the ship okay kidnapping yeah exactly
data/009602.wav|you basically say if you're not with
data/026696.wav|but out of nowhere he gets it
data/021997.wav|they followed it with significantly less
data/004722.wav|when it comes out tomorrow okay
data/001067.wav|is something you enjoy uh but
data/012395.wav|the resistance or whatever so kroy gets up on this balcony in front
data/022755.wav|to a t that is literally the story of mark cuban because number three radio on the internet was yahoo's acquisition of
data/000888.wav|how about i pick someone else

data/023263.wav|be outside yeah that's what he's thinking
data/029547.wav|if you go on stage you're like smash four it's
data/024212.wav|the getting those groups are pretty interesting because those groups are
data/023411.wav|are you inspired me to do radiant
data/017225.wav|the brand's account shot back ask your mom but the guy was completely not

data/001596.wav|healthy and nutritious and tasty legitimately tasty meals that i really do enjoy and i've been eating for like
data/032424.wav|and then three calling someone a
data/012463.wav|meet including the kids like oh my god it's
data/026046.wav|if the at i'm not gonna say there's
data/026240.wav|and often they lead you to spend now
data/027859.wav|well of of a larger financial reckoning by the dip
data/008937.wav|it owns a company could theoretically make changes improve its profitability maybe sell it go public again but if he just
data/005454.wav|yeah target goes hard dude target goes
data/010298.wav|but i just don't know him and i have no in with him i have no contact
data/027435.wav|and nobody nobody saw it so i'm glad i see the
data/029617.wav|that's actually one of those things like if you try to beat the best you're always like rotating around

data/019089.wav|now a needs your support so
data/000715.wav|but in high school i always thought you were
data/015478.wav|scarlett johansson sues them for breach of contract they're just locked into a lot of contracts that want to keep things the way things are
data/006882.wav|and then he was tipping the dealer more than my salary like over the course of that night i
data/031539.wav|is the best player of all time so
data/012688.wav|with both hands begging for escapism
data/015571.wav|as their own streaming service and uh or you can have

data/011489.wav|you know as my favorite thing in the whole i world but today i'm gonna try different they were we don't do that okay you know that's my favorite thing in the whole wide world but today i'm gonna try
data/019824.wav|all this stuff they all talked about it and none of it was there at launch this game was one of the most disappointing launch games in history and if i only talked about the moment of launch it's just
data/006741.wav|they don't i'm in meetings with all
data/019717.wav|and this is the amount of student debt right so in
data/032239.wav|and just before i turn to walk away
data/015187.wav|the dollars to create korean only shows
data/018987.wav|and understand they were competing from day one with tick-tock which just did it better and

data/018714.wav|on getting them signed up for
data/020805.wav|but i have not yet seen what we're about to watch don't get canceled don't get
data/005358.wav|first i literally don't react i just assume he's talking to someone else so we like he like he's like looks me
data/022229.wav|are you trying to like bat my hair
data/028896.wav|no i i absolutely i vomited to be quite clear um so but apparently the whole night at

data/004723.wav|am i the only person that genuinely likes listening to the music like willingly in their spare time oh dude
data/025484.wav|so the fail is this guy
data/026086.wav|they just found a different white guy
data/009118.wav|the new ways of stupid that i can't even comprehend it it baffled me at first
data/004790.wav|when you start to look into it and so i found this
data/019936.wav|is the oil market for years and years and years and
data/014324.wav|mail shipping company and then when it became a streaming service it didn't make any of its own content you
data/013940.wav|so yeah everything's easy fun smile clean app if you miss any
data/018222.wav|add you're trying to attract parents you're trying to get families
data/013864.wav|you don't care okay this is a good way to get them to get in the
data/009494.wav|the minecraft bed wars looking for control
data/007162.wav|is the people you you grew up with and
data/021763.wav|it's just like it's so sad it's sad to just go back to the past to try and make a quick buck and the takeaway is not that i want to eat local with ubereats i mean the food never even
data/019620.wav|which as you know like canadian prime minister is like almost as high as like a
data/032244.wav|our bills and he pulls out this little
data/021881.wav|with the photos that i want to tell you

data/010808.wav|the a lot i skip go through morbius one to get
data/001544.wav|let's see who can i can pull up
data/024142.wav|what they did and it was leading to big
data/031770.wav|you know the lore because if there's a
data/029138.wav|we would consult the helix fossil all the time like in game
data/024997.wav|you know i don't like their service it's like they're doing something that pisses me off in the moment alaska hates starbucks
data/014451.wav|at the one that but i don't think you will choose apply for mr on that but i don't think people choose
data/025206.wav|and anniversary event recently apparently they were so stingy it was like the stingiest anniversary
data/000282.wav|our company like they're not so
data/011943.wav|it's probably like a total of 150
data/012007.wav|part of a very important mission
data/020519.wav|you can't blame the marketing guys for doing their best job what they've realized very quickly is that reputation is everything your brand is everything losing your brand means you're just another
data/002686.wav|as you should have a walk-away
data/018182.wav|but i'm opening the ad review okay it's the
data/016644.wav|fast enough i'm not sure but
data/031926.wav|but we were like really really
data/023958.wav|what cheaper but the problem is that selling it cheaper with no
data/026078.wav|if any clip gets popular they will automatically write an article about it and and sort of farm it for clickbait
data/030811.wav|war it was like it's a free a free fish game and once i found that fish game i did not spend another second looking at fish here it
data/030482.wav|there'll be a candle on the table
data/019928.wav|it's happened a million times ever
data/024195.wav|we just playing the wait and see because twitch
data/005606.wav|walking up to me and i'm like this
data/024027.wav|so that they and then only show the
data/019479.wav|so get out there and play because you've got to
data/026188.wav|if dividends for riot all of their games
data/014905.wav|we're fighting the fight they should have fought although it feels
data/010792.wav|which they make a morbius too
data/018941.wav|let me see if i can find some quibby ads
data/031530.wav|is his ability to create the biggest armies it's called macro the ability
data/009623.wav|back to back is what the crowd is chanting for mr
data/012389.wav|so we we get to the
data/005141.wav|right now just hold one second
data/021221.wav|i think they're going to cut their losses as of the end of
data/020649.wav|team and these lights can get the camera to focus on me please please
data/025680.wav|add something that makes you afraid these are my these are the prime ones my
data/002791.wav|the artist is not well known and this song got massive off of just this video randomly and then they put him in the music video but barely and if
data/005326.wav|in the front section and it was like kind of
data/014231.wav|if the for streamers and so instead of like it being
data/030628.wav|if the of germany i i hear there's going to be a geography be at school except
data/018536.wav|aims to do that you are willing to take a loss bethesda is going to take a
data/019785.wav|i feel like this but when you watch it
data/028688.wav|so i i don't want to
data/015287.wav|talk a little bigger hdmx a
data/002785.wav|it's really anyway let me get uh
data/027280.wav|ads for dark souls 2 that basically said how
data/019091.wav|we're seeing right now is v tubers so i showed you
data/002976.wav|camera goes off and we're in the theater in darkness and
data/001396.wav|something about this game show is perfect and something about it is flawed i can't figure out if there's a flaw here
data/029700.wav|nowhere near mega i felt kind of good
data/021932.wav|in the past all right there was still new
data/007376.wav|on whether a top a type did mango make it if yes topic could be pretty good if no
data/027066.wav|was making goofy sounds like people love
data/028054.wav|if the wins and fail show number one i'd like you all to say a farewell to the ipod it may not have
data/015636.wav|and customer and as long as
data/030917.wav|well listen i think you're great all
data/023208.wav|model of apple juice you're not getting a bottle of apple juice you're getting
data/022560.wav|we found that's just not effective enough that's why we're excited to launch a brand new premium feature duolingo push
data/017650.wav|so if you look at google search volume apple store near me is more popular than supermarket near me haircut near me convenience store near me and often especially lately church near me they're i mean they're like temples they
data/005847.wav|i saw in his eyes that he had seen that
data/008604.wav|they're like leaking the text messages uh here it is
data/018274.wav|i always have a cup for whoever gets
data/030242.wav|so one christmas i couldn't go home to my family because my family lived in germany and i went to college in arizona so i was like oh okay i'm
data/022485.wav|while they don't get me you don't you feel like you're you're understood for a
data/001273.wav|look at all these game posters
data/008138.wav|anyway that was funny not worth
data/008877.wav|minimum daily active users discussion you know
data/024355.wav|okay the the stunt is cool and i assume
data/009011.wav|is that good content i hear woo was thinking i would open up a lobby
data/021868.wav|it's to work let me figure out the good habits that make me
data/029836.wav|it's a really wrong because he pulls out some
data/002842.wav|his arguments and said we're gonna
data/027595.wav|cause he'll make improvements to it and he is a good man but
data/030132.wav|so i had to like literally when my dad
data/001235.wav|i don't think necessarily that a good
data/010154.wav|outbid and then my dad called me and said hey is this all right i
data/015309.wav|it's got that kind of money um
data/008701.wav|i i'm trying to hide like he's got to prove
data/017264.wav|let's get back to the wins though uh we
data/012576.wav|no you don't know because i haven't told the end part i
data/026852.wav|so much so she also sold swanky seashell accessories shiny
data/005418.wav|with youtube um i i literally i think
data/002934.wav|wait and everything i don't know
data/009302.wav|small things you can make that would actually make the industry a little safer for people who are susceptible
data/008348.wav|generally so he goes door to door
data/031988.wav|how the times have changed it's so funny
data/004453.wav|is slurpy day good marketing like
data/021784.wav|in nature to help us heal and reconnect with the ones we love the most
data/023509.wav|in the amount of dealerships so look at this
data/030102.wav|this is the folly of youth when i read nintendo power and i hear that i think oh my god
data/011991.wav|who on the crew or who
data/012770.wav|cause people i know in my life and he's
data/008903.wav|or a working institution we can't have that it makes no sense up yours woke moralists hey if
data/019547.wav|god wait what is this some guy wrote
data/028503.wav|the bonding moment little do you know how
data/009789.wav|all gas heated buildings are being dropped to 17 degrees
data/015147.wav|make that money netflix does not have that
data/027520.wav|the product at all in like seven years i
data/032271.wav|if the table he's literally teleconferencing gambling a thousand dollars on
data/023748.wav|one or more in car insurance oh
data/000398.wav|and that's when we go to gamble and germa comes with us german
data/021686.wav|certain is better by rocket mortgage we even afford this house i'm pretty sure we can pretty sure rocket mortgage you can be certain not pretty sure i'm pretty sure you could take batista down
data/015781.wav|big enough to have a major impact but it is look there's a lot of there's like
data/024289.wav|it's very tied it back to the product
data/021107.wav|it's not like i'm not gonna i'm not
data/022282.wav|it reminds me of childhood memories
data/008614.wav|was that doesn't want to own the company i mean there's a real chance that if
data/001830.wav|in materials and water and everything needed to make it it seems like it's a very daunting task that may not come to real fruition but they sure are paying a lot of people to work on it i was reading that people
data/004692.wav|get excited and having a good day and ready into a good weekend i truly mean that you know
data/004070.wav|the cheers such an awkward terrible thing to
data/004891.wav|in their perspective okay so flashback four months not three but four a month before
data/027319.wav|i could never match but i think this is a huge part of some of the core rabid fans that have built the enduring brand of dark souls and i think to remove that capability would remove these fans and remove their ability to help spread this message
data/026562.wav|watch cinematic universe i assume that this is all part of a plan to make an absolute dummy amount of money but if he actually
data/018263.wav|why stop it it's a one but it's betw it's a lot of
data/030283.wav|like what are my odds here and finally i
data/009984.wav|give me a chance my melodies will make the
data/015384.wav|something called project popcorn when hbo was
data/010827.wav|the chat provides all of it
data/018789.wav|i studied marketing in school we collectively will be sifting through a treasure trove of hundreds of ads to find the very best using a voting system one through five after every ad chat we'll vote we will talk about it
data/031221.wav|i don't like that you know and the competitions are like all about business skills so it'll be like your team on
data/017768.wav|invested in this area he would do frequent
data/010296.wav|if someone gets me in contact with
data/004704.wav|he's trying his best to be relatable
data/030999.wav|in sell for massively inflated prices there was a crop of mysterious arsons happening in rank controlled apartments
data/008683.wav|read a lot of different opinions from people
data/017482.wav|whether through awareness support through any of these
data/011895.wav|whatever you know which is fine for me honestly
data/031931.wav|it's like a 30 minute limo ride and
data/028873.wav|it was this bar in seoul that if you could show your id and you were a
data/018083.wav|whatever it takes to not die to this goddamn coke truck
data/028848.wav|and i'm just living at the office i wake up and i'm like i got a
data/027421.wav|yeah like when you tell everyone it's gonna
data/021141.wav|you're trying to maintain but if
data/001091.wav|i can't in good conscience say that i am the one to give you that advice i can tell you you can do what i didn't
data/006879.wav|the the cards wasn't the biggest deal
data/024061.wav|months and months of no downloads total flop all right so
data/016577.wav|i have a friend who graduated from
data/024371.wav|the commercial and then later they had to actually
data/031847.wav|im ninja everyone in this category wanted to be ninja and then just like
data/001551.wav|what is the hottest place in america
data/012410.wav|so so anyway we were like off in our group and but luckily luckily on our side is like a bunch of
data/012941.wav|what you can't do with paid
data/030584.wav|we're cool all right if you'd like to join my kahoot the pin is i'm gonna say it
data/021714.wav|want to buy a car i think no more or less of toyota after watching this
data/008954.wav|i think he had a bigger plan with it i don't think he was besides the last time he needed an excuse to sell his shares he just made a
data/018719.wav|it's like a pressure price it's like a price that just makes you want to jump on it now what does sony
data/028008.wav|when microsoft and sony the real winner will be the gamers both sides are getting better both sides are getting better games pc gamers are winning most of all because they both have
data/018959.wav|what are you doing you're browsing your
data/020631.wav|of my anger is that this is a disingenuous
data/029606.wav|i can't even you can't even touch him you can't
data/007695.wav|i first started dating her than i do now
data/004640.wav|i'll be looking for a stable bit of wealth management and we have a full service platform helping to make sure that your
data/021967.wav|you're a billionaire on your way to a trillionaire there's one more thing you gotta do okay and it's really important fill the last half of your book with puff pieces let me give you an example of one story that really stood out to me by the way i think this is a true story but it's so funny that he chose to
data/005522.wav|i you know what i love my family so whatever it's
data/014215.wav|i cannot read every sub while i'm doing
data/002049.wav|i changed it to say that i'm not looking for someone who's living at home with their mother
data/030965.wav|do you get zits a truck
data/001728.wav|the the tell them that he's lost everything and he's like he's like scared and he's like worried and so he bets all of his money on like a
data/027068.wav|when you do that you got
data/012697.wav|if if you have friends that are
data/025319.wav|some other idiot in a neverending
data/032312.wav|that's why for the past five streams or whatever
data/021514.wav|we are safely they invested it in risky naked gamestop shorts so now not only are
data/017702.wav|they were very slash extremely satisfied after their visit these are unheard of numbers in the world of
data/018023.wav|bad examples good and bad examples i would like to show you what may be the greatest example of all time
data/009552.wav|and i think if they drafted differently those guys could take over a game that
data/027722.wav|if the yearly salary of the CEO of Coca-Cola
data/015944.wav|that works well is hard and that's why
data/009113.wav|makes sense doesn't make sense it doesn't add up the story doesn't add up ember kingdom name of the three months youtube frogs shanghai makes sense it doesn't make sense it doesn't add up the story doesn't add up
data/008893.wav|he's owning the lib so hard yeah
data/018664.wav|dominated the world if you are old enough to remember the
data/014367.wav|is so incentivizing for big developers to focus only on twitch drops
data/007854.wav|we can all relate sometimes this gets busy
data/010257.wav|i was living with his family having a good life and now who that lives with
data/003680.wav|harshly enforced estate taxes like the top tax rate was very high estate taxes were very strong
data/024889.wav|well actually one of the most devious examples i've seen
data/015890.wav|it's android and apple yeah they can't
data/025947.wav|we're going to three million dollars franchise in the
data/005040.wav|so it'll be like a top reply from like
data/026757.wav|by sony now the second thing they have to do is this announce their competitor to
data/002839.wav|sort of the big boss around

data/025448.wav|almost daring capitalism to stop him and i would like to give a a salute
data/009759.wav|and neither of them are like that great
data/020797.wav|it's actually very hard for a
data/021379.wav|and then i hope that it goes down to like 50 and then i just buy
data/013973.wav|is giving you debt with high risk that's about it that's it so i
data/025679.wav|to get that deep psychological response but you don't want the risk of something like this you go for a more spooky
data/015452.wav|at the theater than almost every other studio
data/022310.wav|we're just said never speak to me
data/000736.wav|well it's like we all we're all losing together at least it's
data/026576.wav|it's been four million takes on this i'm just
data/027633.wav|like a dollars he has a few billion dollars and he has a lot of tesla stock and if
data/002463.wav|and they found that there was consumers who were like they they called them like
data/009454.wav|a pretty hefty amount on beast
data/025969.wav|well of this at the end of the day blizzard has one thing that is keeping it going
data/022872.wav|it it could not have kicked off in a more perfect way the apple versus epic lawsuit was held
data/027612.wav|realistically the problem at twitter stems from leadership rather than like
data/008328.wav|what camera do you use i'm a professional videographer and your camera looks amazing yeah i use a
data/012784.wav|the of his debates and then he would
data/023401.wav|three years late thoughts on costco keeping the price of
data/024176.wav|in the yard there's definitely more coming
data/004879.wav|at the companies like neurolink is
data/026252.wav|worth 3 trillion dollars that is worth
data/011958.wav|i don't want to just be on the sidelines
data/022716.wav|but you get the idea he was a big sweaty loud yelling man who had gotten obscenely rich as microsoft grew in the
data/017653.wav|well the product it signifies and
data/011201.wav|with the generational wealth that's crazy
data/024577.wav|okay but at the end of the day when you did this and violated your agreement with apple you broke a contract and there's nothing more sacred in this court of law than a contract so at the end of the day you have to pay apple 12 million dollars for violating
data/001241.wav|i think the xbox tick tock is amazing i think it's like the perfect blend of like
data/013323.wav|and i can't throw you very far
data/000818.wav|not seriously but i thought about it i thought about it i was gonna do

data/026492.wav|no you can you don't have the rights okay and where after two months of outreach conversation no you can't you don't have the rights okay
data/019520.wav|it's not as catchy the tune isn't as good
data/025200.wav|see if i can finally bring it out of this
data/029987.wav|was in the way and i needed
data/001007.wav|you really you don't have to worry about it
data/008206.wav|is cringe they are doing many things that are anti the will of the majority of people that not much more i'm
data/007421.wav|okay so you can see it right here
data/027887.wav|with the shopping online the idea was that uh
data/003367.wav|and so if possible um do what you can
data/006144.wav|team that i made in the last second and
data/029904.wav|after that like literally it it started so much later
data/025052.wav|when quickly tech brands tech brands is almost all
data/031414.wav|here don't worry about that second of all you don't need to ask
data/008051.wav|you said hey big a mobile viewer here congrats on the engagement
data/014556.wav|with a job that i'm focused on but
data/001075.wav|you ever hung out with someone who
data/000251.wav|they all drove out and one of them wasn't he's a teacher so he
data/007945.wav|when it comes to entertaining the audience i am just i'm happy to be here when
data/013593.wav|slime was he doing it was
data/013119.wav|got dinner with jay-z booked thursday
data/016200.wav|if you like but then also help a billionaire get a little bit richer and that's i think
data/012035.wav|and then you hold it for half a second
data/011331.wav|right i forgot all right all files
data/024414.wav|look at this and they're like you're behind
data/020299.wav|the snowman doing this a cutaway to a funeral with the kid at
data/012906.wav|my friends um i think even like ludwig and
data/005399.wav|who is now like a 30 million view month
data/012265.wav|do you think any of the
data/026626.wav|his companies bait raped on how much cash
data/024233.wav|okay my first thought is how the did that cost five million dollars where did the money go i guess they must
data/003121.wav|i don't think they pay particularly high
data/023533.wav|and the margin of ferrari they make as much money per phone as like a ferrari
data/024000.wav|i got them all of like fans lee and fan house
data/004358.wav|or for you felt like that was worth it because you had to go get that you
data/024641.wav|know that the chinese economy has been growing rapidly over the past
data/028269.wav|no it turns out this guy had written i worked at x company
data/008088.wav|live on air to go to who that
data/030724.wav|vladimir putin probably only got the bicycle question
data/026844.wav|or life which basically means ignored then we have the seats here for
data/028351.wav|the whole company marcus heavily outranks ben
data/014439.wav|we just won completely and twitch thinks
data/007768.wav|man gets hungry and you don't know what
data/019997.wav|i think the best media acquisition of all time some of you guys are not
data/031453.wav|at which point when i got the ball back i immediately
data/003022.wav|this is the only thing we can find when
data/022118.wav|it's about any brand tweet that gets replies or responses or retweets
data/031791.wav|in the thick the lines are between minecraft
data/001686.wav|getting rid of that idea or not i want to be clear grandpa joe is
data/005589.wav|or buckets of wings there was buckets of wings showing up there was tons of like
data/007462.wav|by the way by the way
data/029393.wav|i didn't get it then i realized the waiter's coming around
data/025688.wav|yeah peter dill the vp of marketing peter dill weed more like it peter dill the vp of marketing for sony
data/022608.wav|new product you can go like super goofy like this or you can go like on the edge of believable
data/027644.wav|was on twitter's shoulders as a private company and we're looking at something like a two billion dollar yearly interest payment just to pay the debt for elon musk buying the company he is
data/019863.wav|at the story in the universe was huge
data/019357.wav|with six we were losing ground there were dmc we're starting to catch up and with six we were losing ground they were dmc was starting to catch up and i was like
data/024722.wav|and everything stays super high then it becomes like it is now where it's impossible to
data/026957.wav|it's the first good ad i think they got their
data/013018.wav|so you could actually maybe even
data/016980.wav|and come back live for some shark tank oh i didn't want to recommend one more thing while you're here
data/020340.wav|he knew every model every color
data/008563.wav|and everything he's requested they've sent
data/029653.wav|and i like what she's talking to
data/006497.wav|which is going to be the exact same thing as karna and
data/026106.wav|why it was a powerful image i really really was impressed by it and the
data/028912.wav|at that point when i get back down i believe is when the night starts to take a turn for the less fun that's when i start to realize i'm
data/027480.wav|i thought was impossible every single person on twitter has posted every single variant of every possible take
data/024856.wav|these people for the killers you sell competitive advantage
data/023127.wav|if there was a locust plague and the government was like
data/002487.wav|in in their products to basically ensure they get a
data/001428.wav|the the question for some money of course
data/015193.wav|put out globally but now they're realizing there is cheap good talent in all
data/009860.wav|in and yeah and and there's
data/014886.wav|someone who's got their finger on the pulse of what gamers actually want and if you look
data/027002.wav|again you're competing with other amazing commercials with huge
data/023280.wav|or i was like how the so
data/020877.wav|most companies won't even offer it and so the government stepped in to do like this fake fire insurance because you need it so if there ever is like a catastrophic fire or hurricane it's
data/026175.wav|what do you do well there's one option this is
data/015214.wav|bro i support more than two languages yeah
data/011938.wav|i you know resistant activity on this ship and we're
data/001775.wav|it's bag of him slow dancing with one of your employees
data/013002.wav|worried about learning this one thing in math you could actually get it i think that's the way to learn i think i think
data/018512.wav|it's clearly made it a strategic priority
data/012404.wav|first order members to rise up like
data/028872.wav|yeah okay so i did 21
data/010249.wav|well marketing scheme which is appropriate uh you know
data/023954.wav|and so they're copying things from america again and also brandless failed dramatically
data/005829.wav|i talked to e about it
data/013110.wav|funniest tweets of the year so far literally gut busting laughter i
data/008474.wav|where the exposure i've given him then we will
data/018228.wav|but like no one's taking this
data/022549.wav|when it came out wait how did you think it was an ad pokemon go no you didn't think
data/012826.wav|when i was playing all league
data/028246.wav|piercing it was like a painting that follows you i'm like looking at
data/017002.wav|you're in just a minute we're
data/029316.wav|the hyper fan i was a guy who'd put thousands of hours
data/025614.wav|us for let's see what's a fail though to
data/030234.wav|the was no face because that's the money
data/011303.wav|okay what'd you say i have
data/022421.wav|or whatever it just the whole idea of like trying to like logically argue your way to a better product in marketing
data/007533.wav|is literally it this is the
data/010411.wav|if the were voice it's not great you're still choosing coke or pepsi you know
data/020006.wav|they were acquired and it's because they became essentially the de facto
data/007081.wav|except for one time just to be a dick about it
data/017432.wav|and i sit at home drinking green smoothies and meditating i'll have
data/026606.wav|to watch the show the way he delivered this ad read made me feel like i was there watching
data/022718.wav|but just stayed still for like 10 years
data/027805.wav|instead of tapering it off they actually kept going and increased it
data/000346.wav|for the guy running the place we looked
data/005848.wav|but he's like oh no what clip
data/028822.wav|you can take whatever you want and they're always restocked dozens of walls of snacks dude any
data/026304.wav|we stand out from their competitors okay the money has gone from here to here because as
data/020828.wav|and talk about marketing or tuesday and uh some people said it
data/008038.wav|so far have you seen the
data/032421.wav|it's more important to dodge to get greedy
data/023209.wav|in some apple juice and a lot of like grape juice white grape juice but it's
data/023391.wav|and motivation for marketing yeah of course bro when i was working at twitch and i
data/008878.wav|if twitter sold for less to elon would
data/024519.wav|the judge said was and this is really good
data/011500.wav|it'd be an interesting movie but they sold it
data/021290.wav|if you guys are watching me right now
data/011441.wav|in ireland so you have to fly over also i don't know how to cut hair you drive a hard bargain irishman steve but that's the kind of moxie you want
data/023305.wav|coke zero sugar that's it and then it became not a story
data/019271.wav|you know how to make great exclusive and a great next-gen console he posted on
data/008371.wav|although they're trying to automate i mean have you seen the
data/008471.wav|oh marketing monday oh yeah it was fun
data/017440.wav|anyway whatever it is it all seems really cool it all seems really cool i love that i love that i love the ground of the
data/002298.wav|at the three months is so different everybody all your viewers still
data/013077.wav|that's the thing is with youtube it's the
data/017335.wav|so there is a positive benefit i'm not going to
data/018240.wav|to play this child that was an interesting what was that trying to say like their competitors are the devil or what
data/013535.wav|were bonding gaming thing when it was just him
data/027407.wav|for the vast majority of americans how much they owe in taxes it's already reported by their employer the irs has a number in
data/027285.wav|will make sense in a second
data/016668.wav|here's one that is relevant to me specifically
data/012181.wav|everyone's like wait where's he going
data/015751.wav|future that doesn't exist because people are literally just scavenging the parts they need and so
data/012039.wav|if the four and a half minutes
data/013871.wav|the main thing let's do one more fail
data/009281.wav|there's no way they sell individual ad spots it's probably a much larger package deal
data/004502.wav|if anyone can watch it whenever it's their birthday
data/027433.wav|are committed to protecting your investment and your tenants hashtag owners and neighbors and it got with paid literally zero

data/010028.wav|it's the best one out of ten means it's it's number one out of your last 10 videos
data/010776.wav|page you said keys let's go keys let's go keys let's go keys let's go keys let's go keys a thousand
data/008139.wav|i wish i could i wish i could have
data/009994.wav|in your corner of your stream for a month okay we
data/016601.wav|trying to do it's a it's just a tailwind behind
data/027207.wav|when the entire opposite direction and when people played demos of it they
data/002363.wav|in flies when i'm watching thanks for all the great moments and content these past
data/018046.wav|it should have been a coke can
data/003863.wav|if he didn't do that i think he could have a better chance of getting
data/017176.wav|i have begun the process of working on that but i was pretty slow because i had coveted which i'm going to use as an
data/031943.wav|and i remember there was that thing
data/008048.wav|long paragraphs of text which there's a lot and if you want to see
data/030438.wav|we get to the valentine's day and
data/001846.wav|return to the grind uh no no no no
data/010022.wav|that makes fun of jake novak types do you have it i'd like to see it
data/017211.wav|annie disease is when you get cold sweats when your body is like frigid cold and you want to put a blanket on but the second you do you start sweating through
data/031560.wav|with his back against the wall and that
data/032377.wav|hey i know it can be hard to believe especially if you're having trouble yourself so i made you a video guide i reopened
data/016533.wav|talking about three million dollars if you won
data/026349.wav|describing what it would look like if
data/022109.wav|is over and over terrible so what you want to do is not do
data/024151.wav|the like could not get paid but you know if
data/009893.wav|like up just like a just like a
data/000063.wav|the party i didn't do like a streamer thing
data/014474.wav|one from nvidia and every single person in my life told me to go to blizzard but i had a feeling there was something in my gut or in my brain that was like nvidia would be better for me
data/009528.wav|that's not a bad idea tell him to stay back
data/013799.wav|but i think they think the rat is controlling this but it looks like the rat is just
data/016992.wav|if the check it out it's actually it's it's pretty
data/025599.wav|is that make you seem relatable smile more that was my first win for humanity because we have that guy
data/029969.wav|it's not true he said till the
data/015946.wav|well that it and they've been so slow but now
data/006090.wav|is pop offer was about to pop off on him
data/008175.wav|i did and also i was paid in mousepads
data/023882.wav|a negative shot i'm not even worried about them
data/004620.wav|that of course i obviously can't tell you a happy birthday it wouldn't be fair to the shareholders of
data/008791.wav|more likely is a big billion multi-billion
data/017569.wav|to decrease the amount they spend on commercials advertising digital banner ads etc and yet they've built a brand
data/001925.wav|so why would i you know what i'm saying just because i like streaming i also
data/017374.wav|the industry every ticket sold one out of every
data/006479.wav|the confidence is probably best tied to activity in strip clubs and
data/007903.wav|we're hesitant to gift because i wouldn't want
data/024938.wav|to not go in the direction of making more money these ways so that is one of the most damning and
data/026421.wav|well this is this is mango if you guys know that you know i generally will get more viewers than mango but mango has always
data/019294.wav|been a console gamer or you are thinking about getting a console this generation is the time to jump in I think
data/024228.wav|pedigree so let's start with this
data/026553.wav|i'm stealing i don't give but yes this like
data/029872.wav|he was an employee at twitch
data/017534.wav|below are becoming tuned out to them and so marketing
data/029197.wav|the highest number of watchers a twitch stream had ever
data/008296.wav|people when they study listen to like classical music
data/022021.wav|his tweet will be deleted within the day i know it because the second the new story gets
data/015131.wav|he's the most powerful talent agent in the world right now he's the guy that ari gold from entourage was based off of his
data/021950.wav|okay one thing that has been very clear in my mind and a good way to think about how to be strategic in your life is what is something hard i can do that most other people won't now the famous amazon example is this if you are running a business and someone in the
data/022315.wav|new mobile ordering app with one one thing is it's got a cheesy voice these are not designed for consumers to see they're only for other
data/026000.wav|and to be steve jobs create a fake blood testing company raise nine billion
data/008211.wav|what argument that'll convince you i think it is very
data/011257.wav|it's going to be so we did not we didn't we
data/029525.wav|for years and years and years these guys just didn't have a chance and so when
data/016124.wav|probably probably in a week or so after i visit arizona and uh going to be doing
data/009076.wav|way we'd be like not the non-pal
data/017528.wav|is to answer the question about what is marketing that's not advertising i think
data/018634.wav|and then if they get a they
data/000058.wav|is it fails that i could run into
data/031062.wav|i thought he was going to be really cringe just based purely
data/026640.wav|we're really talking about in technology four or five companies that have absolutely absurd amounts of power and
data/023363.wav|marketing related at all but i was browsing
data/021902.wav|much more likely to fall asleep on time and get good sleep and if i get good sleep then i can actually have the energy to work out the
data/002324.wav|time with them and and hang out with the animals uh much
data/006607.wav|is that made it made it uh very fun and
data/012289.wav|it's it's it's cool you know it feels
data/004160.wav|you have brought receipts from those 25
data/007829.wav|i made that myself by buying stock footage of money like 14 different
data/028110.wav|unfortunately i got scooped by ludwig
data/026845.wav|what were they thinking this is a true waste of money and that's
data/016608.wav|info and not send them down crazy
data/017663.wav|all day to test the experience
data/021699.wav|sounds interesting because it depicts my chat
data/017654.wav|is that they're worth the price tag
data/009846.wav|which is odd given how much me and kanye
data/027213.wav|in the first week absolutely smashing
data/009926.wav|what about the union of marriage i'm getting married so
data/003803.wav|okay if they reach below a certain point if they reach below
data/003878.wav|i was losing faith with the right i mean
data/000330.wav|and it feels scary but if you were to take off the helmet it's a flat piece of
data/023886.wav|monday and that's for humanity on these uh let's see i have oh this is my next w
data/029071.wav|we tell you i scrap with ludwig
data/007995.wav|working hard like is your boss okay with the stream like
data/009844.wav|living in seoul you did not need a car one bit and it was not inconvenient at all legitimately a car would be more inconvenient getting around
data/026945.wav|that are moving into prime house buying years and
data/008162.wav|lud stands and lyric and then i immediately have smite
data/029152.wav|for four hours but i was a kid you know what i'm like
data/031030.wav|i guess infections and stuff all the time and i
data/006915.wav|the same time it would be harder to quit
data/005407.wav|but when you make a like i really am proud of the marketing monday netflix video i think quack did a great job i feel like the research was great i feel like it came together well i feel like if you watched it in a few months you're still getting something out of it like it's still i feel i like that i
data/024776.wav|that is a quote once you break that wall you break them
data/013644.wav|i think a lot about the world and that made me relate to you as a human
data/026920.wav|in this ad yeah he didn't i don't it would have
data/004499.wav|at all times because they could always make this argument what okay
data/002843.wav|this trial in september fairly soon fairly soon which is a big win for twitter's court
data/001957.wav|it's kind of just done live and you make a video out of it it's the one thing i think about but outside of that i'm look i'm i'm
data/003795.wav|be more moderate democrats actually no we don't moderate democrats are the reason why we're here to begin with we need to
data/019866.wav|wow killer type beat and it was a buggy empty mess but this is not only this is not only the matrix online maybe you heard of
data/028111.wav|but didn't do the same video i want to talk to you this is both
data/007353.wav|that was promised we've always wanted a
data/015664.wav|netflix is going to dominate content have low churn and raise prices prime
data/010051.wav|us with his musical talk on school shootings top five rappers eminem was afraid
data/000695.wav|and they start making all this
data/001912.wav|one dollar to quack and it's like ugh
data/011528.wav|in pr team for free and you're broke and you have an anime profile picture on
data/013211.wav|there are only seven harry potter books sad just perfect
data/010787.wav|don't have anything related to it
data/015928.wav|if you guys know this but there's all the
data/017407.wav|so not only did i get forgotten by
data/003363.wav|if there are positive things i just
data/009158.wav|it ranks it based on how long it's been up
data/016019.wav|dubai guess youtube's actually a pretty big deal i think it's uh i think it's worth
data/019016.wav|they don't miss deliverables they don't promise they'll do something in a contract and then get lazy influencers are notoriously unreliable influencers wake up at noon if not one and
data/019437.wav|the brand the company launched the nation's first
data/026215.wav|and i would like to talk really
data/031235.wav|well how to make esports big in the west it turns out they didn't need me they just needed fortnite i was irrelevant to that idea but at the time i was like i'm
data/030081.wav|walking up the whole day i'm always like dude
data/014940.wav|top of the size a little bit of this thing yes sir toss the branded alerts up
data/024912.wav|games that apply over 100 plus roles or 90
data/006850.wav|i've got this trick i got
data/029551.wav|was because they they invited a lot of bailly yeah
data/006310.wav|and youtube sided with him that's
data/031936.wav|and eventually even i'm like okay we've been
data/013683.wav|we are talking about the streaming war between twitch and youtube what it means who's winning how we got here but first we open as always with some wins and fails in the past week of business and marketing starting with a major win for exactly five minutes to twitter shareholders because ceo of twitter jack dorsey finally stepped down to take a roll as gandalf in lord of the rings
data/004449.wav|or it could be a six days late marketing
data/026420.wav|want to bring up somebody i think we all maybe
data/009988.wav|team novak get it training let's turn this around were no longer bullies team novak let's get it training let's turn this around we're no longer bullies
data/013001.wav|like nothing else is bothering you you're not worried about other tests or
data/018135.wav|it's because they can't get their pepsi
data/022941.wav|the war but your license to use unreal engine 4
data/029371.wav|i the win him over i've made him laugh
data/003768.wav|it could have real movement i think it's the beginning of all problems i think
data/029756.wav|on something on the internet yes dude get
data/003807.wav|representatives into doing the right thing i don't know
data/000201.wav|the table so he's always the villain
data/015763.wav|black widow right and it wasn't that successful wasn't black widow's same day
data/026265.wav|of their company beats even mainstays like coca-cola disney
data/004029.wav|that's uh that's a wins and
data/016865.wav|it's of increases and this is just scaling up
data/023679.wav|health insurance which by the way i'm sorry wait i
data/010853.wav|it was like saying come on i i want the points i don't
data/012757.wav|you gotta figure out like well you gotta
data/017621.wav|i have the margins and the
data/009147.wav|honestly honestly one of the worst
data/005908.wav|i think those are the main things that's
data/003673.wav|but then because the wealth is generational and doesn't reset and doesn't there's not
data/018757.wav|and they can just upgrade the front and the
